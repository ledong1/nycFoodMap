Zhen Wei Fang, backed by Wei Chen and the Congee Village team, pairs its pristine hot pot fare with an absolutely wild environment. ', 'A robot host greets guests in Mandarin. Mixed martial arts matches play on four televisions. Michael Jackson pumps through the sound system. Multitiered meat trays rise 3 feet above every table, flaunting vertical croppings of raw lamb, beef, and tofu skin. Diners use chopsticks to plunge red ribbons of New Zealand lamb ($15) into white bone broth, turning the flesh brown, soft, and succulent. You slurp the meat almost as easily as you would a noodle. ', 'Want to combine hot pot with a few hours of sake-fueled karaoke? There are private rooms for that. There are also semi-private rooms that double as immersive multimedia carousels. High-tech projectors broadcast computer-generated nature footage on three separate walls, giving patrons the sensation that they’re dining inside an IMAX universe inspired by 1990s screensavers. Leaves fall over ersatz mountains; palm trees sway in the digital wind. As a waiter sears expensive wagyu over a hot stone, snow falls upward toward outer space. The title song to Free Willy plays on the speakers, and you let silken A5 wagyu, slathered in pork fat and Sichuan chiles, dissolve on your tongue for $80.', 'What a New York story: In the literal shadow of one of the city’s most irrationally packed culinary establishments is a hangout that’s killing it — a little more quietly, and with a lot more heart. And in case anyone’s worried Zhen Wei’s visual antics might compete with the gustatory bliss, there’s another place called Tang down the block hawking high-end hot pot fare in a more sedate environment.', 'The back dining room at Zhen Wei Fang.', 'Once upon a time, a hot pot spot in Vegas was the country’s most expensive restaurant. The chef was Masa Takayama (yes, that guy), who served a $500 omakase of shabu shabu, the Japanese adaptation of the Chinese tradition. It didn’t last, but New York has a solid representation of that elevated style at Macoron, where a celebrated hot pot tasting runs $128. ', 'Chinese hot pots, by contrast, a pan-regional tradition with roots in the Han Dynasty, haven’t reached those levels of extravagance in the Big Apple. High-end Sinosphere fare isn’t nonexistent — one thinks of the $150-plus fish-maw platters at Oriental Garden or the black-truffle luxuries of Hakkasan — but such venues haven’t yet reached the critical mass of expensive French, Japanese, or Italian venues.', 'Local hot pot cuisine in particular remains an affordable affair, ranking with Korean barbecue and American smokehouses as some of the most accessible and vital Big Apple restaurants for groups. Some, like Hou Yi in the East Village, draw in budget diners with $31 all-you-can-eat affairs and self-serve ice cream bars. Others, like Mister Hotpot in Sunset Park, aim for a late-night crowd, hawking reasonably priced meats until 2 a.m.', 'What sets apart Zhen Wei, and the Sichuan-leaning Tang down the block (more on that below), is that they’re modernizing the Manhattan hot pot experience a bit more pronouncedly than their excellent peers. It’s all in a similar vein to the efforts of other ambitious operators from the mainland and Taiwan, which is to say they’re updating and repackaging their ancestral fare for a booming Chinese student population — and anyone else willing to spend a few extra dollars at more fashionably contemporary restaurants.', 'That roughly means patrons at both venues will encounter, to a greater or lesser extent, posh interior designs, performative sourcing, bespoke cocktail lists (ugh), craft beers, orange wines, exorbitant wagyu and abalone, and, at Tang, a lighting scheme so Instagrammable that the Museum of Modern Art would be jealous. ', 'If any of these touches make it feel like a beloved tradition is adopting the moneyed signifiers of obnoxiously hip restaurants, rest assured: Both venues manage to keep their souls — counterbalancing stereotypical indulgences with classically Chinese organ meats and powerfully fragrant broths.', 'The communal experience is a central element of a hot pot meal; one imagines a hungry crew huddled over a single steaming pot. Dinner at Zhen Wei, however, is more uncommonly individualistic.', 'Each patron selects their own $6 broth, which simmers on a personal induction burner. It’s tempting to assert there’s something inherently ridiculous about such a setup; one wouldn’t expect a single order of fondue to come in three separate crocks for sanitary reasons. But I’d retort that the courtesy is entirely less absurd than so many other elements of upscale dining, from the use of four plates underneath a single starter at Per Se to the use of eight different wine glasses during a tasting-menu beverage pairing. ', 'Or, more practically: It’s fun to try out different broths at Zhen Wei by dipping into your neighbors’ pots. It’s the soup version of share plates.', 'Most options work well with everything, though the spicy Sichuan gives a nice kick to neutral items like soft tofu, gorgeously gummy mung bean noodles (take them out when they turn translucent), slippery tendon (as weightless as shaved bonito), and feathery enoki mushrooms. The intensely porky tang of bone broth, in turn, imparts a savory, swine-y aroma to flaky red snapper and firm sea scallops. And sweet and sour tomato, packed with electric acidity and umami, helps tame the gentle funk of lamb or tripe.', 'Every broth boasts a voluptuous roundness that makes them sippable on their own; they’re even better poured into small wooden bowls for ramen-noodle dipping. And although the patrons do much of the cooking here, those stellar soups, intensely funky XO ramekins, and all the prepared items are the fine work of chef Wei Huang, a Guangdong native and pan-regional virtuoso who helmed Zhen Wei’s first location in Miami.', 'The chef grills cumin lamb skewers in the style of a studied Xinjiang hangout, offsetting the juicy meat with marshmallow-like fat. He sends out chilled bang bang chicken that balances the poultry’s clean punch with the searing heat of chiles. He whips up shellfish boils on par with Le Sia, coating barely cooked-through lobster claws with a mess of salted chiles.', 'And he also oversees a kitchen whose cooks ensure everything is sliced thinly enough to cook quickly. This part is simple enough: Tongue tastes like tongue; Spam tastes like Spam. But for what it’s worth, the shaved ribeye is so well marbled it seems to disintegrate with the same elegance as Japanese wagyu, and packs no less flavor at just $12. I recommend enjoying all these cuts in the back room, decorated with four 82-inch televisions, each of which shows Jackie Chan singing on a variety show, on mute.', 'For those who insist on wagyu, Yu Liu’s Tang Hotpot, an offshoot of the East Village noodle shack, provides it at a marginally lower cost. It’s sold here for $65, or as a smaller portion as part of an $80 combination platter with pleasantly chewy abalone, flaky snapper, heady goat leg, beef short ribs (cut a bit too thickly), paper-thin pork, and shrimp (impressively flavored when simmered in seafood soup).', 'The only catch is that the broths, served communally in copper pops from Yunnan, are nominally more expensive than those at Zhen Wei, though they can serve up to four, making them cheaper for larger parties. Spicy Sichuan starts at $18 for the table, while a more “curated” version of the same soup — with a separate pot of pork bone broth — runs $23. ', 'Spoiler: Both taste about the same, delivering no more complexity or flavor than than the versions at Zhen Wei (and arguably a touch less). That brings up the central issue with Tang. Notwithstanding the fact that New Yorkers unquestionably underpay for Chinese fare in almost every form, the quality of Tang’s food and service don’t necessarily match the higher prices it commands. Its beef and lamb selections don’t sing with the clear, powerful flavors one expects. And really, there’s no need for condiments like $4 truffle-oil sesame paste.', 'But what Tang can flaunt is a smart beverage program, energetic bar crowds, and shiny digs — evocative of a mid-aughts power spot — by New Practice Studio, the same firm that did stylish restaurants Hao Noodle and Hunan Slurp.', 'A host escorts Canada Goose jacket-wearing patrons to room booths. Louis Poulsen Radiohus pendant lights, set at uneven heights, do their best impression of summertime fireflies, casting dim luminescence on Italian soapstone tables and chartreuse banquettes.

And smart-tablet ordering systems mean that food sometimes starts to arrive at your table before a waiter finishes taking your order.

Chef Baiguang Han, late of Szechuan Mountain House, doesn’t get to show off his culinary chops as much as his counterpart at Zhen Wei. One exception is a nice platter of braised and chilled meats, a collection that shows off beef shank, duck wings, pig’s ear, and gizzards in all their chewy, snappy, gelatinous glory. That aside, stick to the raw meats and seafood, the nice wines, and the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory scoops of lychee ice cream.', 'Successive waves of gentrification have been pummeling the Bowery since at least the early 2000s, from the Avalon luxury developments and its $3,000-per-month studios to the sprawling clubstaurant that is Vandal, a behemoth that earns its riches by commercializing the street’s artistically populist ethos of yore. ', 'Hot pot spots hawking expensive Japanese beef certainly won’t solve any larger urban problems, alas. But inasmuch as the city continues to change, it’s good to see both older and younger Chinese operators get in on the action, while still keeping things more accessible than their Western counterparts.', 'Cost: Soup base is $5-$6 per person. Meat prices vary per cut. Short rib or beef tongue is $10; prime ribeye is $13; hand-sliced lamb is $16; Japanese wagyu is $80.

1,"['David Chang’s newest restaurant, under chef Eunjo Park, is a bright spot in the mall’s otherwise bleak dining landscape', 'Any acolyte of Gallic gastronomy knows that a fine way to celebrate the unctuous bliss of shellfish is to gel it. Thomas Keller devotes nearly 400 words to the complex technique in his seminal French Laundry Cookbook; the late Joël Robuchon, in turn, practically fueled a worldwide empire with his lobster gelee, setting it in clear jars as if it were a Fabergé egg. ', 'Any adherent of Korean cuisine, however, knows that an easier but no less stunning way to achieve this effect is to throw a few raw crabs in soy sauce, let them marinate for a while, and then eat them raw. This is called ganjang-gejang, and to consume it means to experience the pure, unadulterated jelly of the sea.', 'It’s not a dish that has achieved the ubiquity of uni or fluke ceviche. If you’re enjoying raw soy crab in the five boroughs, odds are you’re dining at a select group of rustic Korean spots. The slithery meat hasn’t regularly found its way onto brasserie shellfish plateaus — or into the city’s thriving community of more creative Korean hangouts. In fact, when South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook visited the Big Apple in 2017, she jetted over her own ganjang-gejang for a dinner in Flushing, claiming, correctly, that its availability was limited in the U.S.', 'Enter Eunjo Park. The chef, who grew up in Seoul, runs Kawi, the most resolutely Korean member of David Chang’s internationalist Momofuku empire. She is here to give us dry-aged steaks, pricey wagyu rice cakes, and a high-profile platform for that crab.', 'She prepares the meat classically, letting female crabs soak in soy before chopping them into quarters. The flesh itself is translucent. It dissolves on the tongue like hot bone marrow — except the crustacean is cold, salty, and sweet, with a delicate tidal whiff. Koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; Park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel. This all begs for crisp sheets of gim (dried seaweed), which are provided for making wraps. But really, the main event here is a singular one, and that is sucking out the meat from speckled oceanic appendages.', 'The raw crab is above; below, Eunjo Park works the pass at Kawi', 'Modern Korean food is New York food — no less so than any pastrami hut, trattoria, Sichuan spot, or South American food hall stall. The movement isn’t dependent on the Momofuku brand for legitimacy; it’s already thriving across the city, at packed venues like Haenyeo, Cote, Oiji, Atomix, Her Name Is Han, Soogil, Hanjan, and too many others to list. But the addition of Kawi to the ranks certainly doesn’t hurt. Indeed, it’s heartwarming to see a superstar operator show up to a $25 billion complex that’s become a bastion of bland steakhouses and use it to represent dishes that are still largely underrepresented, or undervalued, throughout the country’s fine dining scene.', 'Take kimbap, maki-like rice-and-seaweed rolls that are more commonly found at Asian takeout spots. Park goes for a bit of elevation with these, stuffing them with buttery foie gras, torched short rib, and best of all, sweet omelet chunks and dried anchovy. On the side is a two-ounce tin of trout roe to amp up the umami. It’s not cheap at $50, but the mix of salt, sugars, and oceanic oils make it one of the city’s more affordably generous caviar services.', 'New York does not suffer from a shortage of tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), but no one quite prepares a version of this delicacy like Park. She pipes the tteok into a single pinwheel, pan-fries it in chile jam, and tops it off with Benton’s smoky mountain ham. The net effect of this cross-cultural alchemy is a blood-red product sporting the dense chew of a firm steak, the fire of hot wings, and the complex, nutty porkiness of Spanish Iberico. Even amid the city’s crowded Korean scene, Park, who’s worked at Ko, Per Se, and the three-Michelin-starred Gaon in Seoul, makes stunning fare that feels no less urgent.', 'Momofuku, born from an East Village ramen shop in 2004, now boasts 11 restaurants on two coasts, with outposts in Sydney and Toronto to boot. Expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen Nobus across the world. Chang has avoided this conundrum so far. As he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from Paul Carmichael’s Caribbean-Pacific tastings at Seibo in Sydney to Max Ng’s Singaporean-accented dishes at Ssäm Bar.', 'Times critic Pete Wells touched on these themes in a fine essay from last year, but a significant question remained: Would Momofuku be able to keep up the creativity after taking on an infusion of funds from RSE capital? Apparently, yes. Just as Chang has lit gustatory fires in sleepy hotels and casinos, the two restaurants he’s opened in posh shopping centers this year — not exactly paragons of innovation — have been as interesting as anything from his early East Village days. ', 'Kawi has some of the strongest flavors and spice levels of any Momofuku. Park deploys a sweet pepper sofrito to tame the funk of tiny raw clams — but only barely. She sends out spicy tuna kimbap that packs a level of heat more characteristic of a competitive eating contest. But because this wouldn’t be a true Chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, Park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. She tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. At the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top. The layering of crunch, sweetness, silkiness, and slipperiness, all in one bite, with a yuzu perfume to boot, is as good as any Jean-Georges Vongerichten masterpiece. Call it tofu brulee.', 'The setting for these indulgences is nothing too spectacular, and that’s not a problem. Chang has never been about vistas. Kawi is simply a windowless room filled with dark woods, soft banquettes, and classic rock. There is no view of the Vessel, thank goodness, only a view of what matters: the open kitchen, where Park wields a blowtorch with aplomb.', 'The fact that there hasn’t been much debate over Kawi’s prices likely constitutes a minor victory, or a least a dose of hope for a pantheon of immigrant chefs who have struggled with the burden of being viewed as cheap. One of the longstanding riddles of the culinary world is that the chief difference between an order of dumplings and a plate of ravioli is 10 bucks.', 'But things are changing. In an era when Korean tasting menus can command $700 for two, it’s perhaps not surprising that rice cakes, which typically run $13 or so, can scratch at $40 after tax and tip here. ', 'Tableside service is included. A server drops by to dip into your wagyu ragu with golden shears. He takes each tteok, as long as spaghetti, and snips it into bite-sized gnocchi. The creaminess of the cake achieves a symbiosis with the savory meat gravy. Kawi makes its own rice cakes using an extruder; most restaurants buy theirs, and the result is a product that’s softer, lighter, and more tender than elsewhere. ', 'That process costs money, but in an exorbitant mall, it’s worth not overlooking value. Inasmuch as Chang complains about overpriced pasta, most Italian spots are nice enough to do half portions for a lower prices. The giant wagyu ragu could, at $35, could easily be downsized. Same goes for the cakes coated in Parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites. Even the chilled chickpea noodles are expensive by any standard; one dips the firm pasta into a cool pool of sesame sauce, making for an excellent spring tsukemen of sorts. This easygoing dish runs a steep $28.', 'The real deal at Kawi, however, however, is the chicken for four. Park slowly roasts a breast, skins it, and lies it over rice noodles for a warm, comforting feast. In a separate bowl sit all sorts of wings, drumsticks, thighs, and errant pieces of skin. They’ve been fried, sans batter, for a pure chicken crunch. A generous sprinkle of togarashi adds just the right amount of salt and heat. At $67, the dish is easily chicken for two, with enough leftovers for days.', 'There is no printed dessert menu the kitchen uses the power of sound to market its signature sweet. Anyone who sits near the chef’s counter will hear the soft thumping of the bingsu machine, the Korean term for kakigori. The pulsing is soothing and repetitive, not unlike windshield wipers. Ice piles high in a wooden bowl, which a chef squirts with syrup and whipped cream. The flavors here are subtle and almost monochromatic. You dip your spoon into the volcano-shaped dome, retrieve a mass of snow, and let it dissolve on the tongue into pool of warming ginger. ', 'It’s tempting to wish Kawi was literally anywhere else, but if it can act as a calling card for modern Korean, a beacon for tourists who might not have otherwise engaged with it, this restaurant is arguably right where it should be.', 'Cost: About $100 per person or more. Small plates — chicken wings, fried cod with yuzu — are $12 to $17; raw fish is $18 to $34; larger plates, including steaks, rice cakes, kimbap rolls, and stews, run $27 to $60.', 'Sample dishes: Soft tofu with salmon roe, raw clams with sofrito and chile, raw marinated crab, wagyu ragu, chilled chickpea noodles, rice cakes with chile jam and Benton’s smoky mountain ham, boiled whole chicken, bingsoo (Korean shaved ice).\xa0', 'Bonus tip: Don’t sleep on lunch, the only time to sample the rice cakes with Benton’s ham. A midday meal will give you enough time to hit up Peach Mart next door before it closes; try the black sesame and butter sandwiches, or stuff a collection of Asian candies (including Hi-Chew) into a long takeaway tube.', 'Disclosure: David Chang is producing shows for Hulu in partnership with Vox Media Studios, part of Eater’s parent company, Vox Media. No Eater staff member is involved in the production of those shows, and this does not impact coverage on Eater.']"
2,"['The Greenwich Village mainstay is seemingly stuck in the past, even with a new menu from chef Victoria Blamey', 'The sale of foie gras — a fatty indulgence that punches you in the gut, steals your money, and tries to make you feel good about that transaction — will soon be illegal in New York City. Most restaurants, however, won’t have to do much to comply. Force-fed duck livers don’t enjoy as much popularity among young culinarians, a class of hospitality types that turns to nimbler luxuries like uni, abalone, and truffles. In fact, simply encountering foie on a new restaurant menu is somewhat rare.', 'Gotham Bar & Grill is an uncommon establishment in this regard. Foie takes center stage at the famed American venue. This is all the more surprising given that the Greenwich Village fixture, for the first time in 34 years, boasts an ambitious new chef: Victoria Blamey, who takes over from Alfred Portale. ', 'Blamey lets foie show off its sweet side, juxtaposing it against saltier, chewier ham hock. For a more savory affair, she glazes the product with a layer of truffled seaweed gelee, imparting the stomach-distending, main course-sized appetizer with bass notes of earthiness. And in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin. It’s a fine ode to 1996, when Gotham paired this delicacy with guinea hen or squab, or to 2013, when the restaurant featured a trio of simultaneous foie preparations as well.', 'Excess is the point of this extravagance, and Blamey prepares it well. But as a legacy restaurant looks toward the future, perhaps a wallet-busting old-school indulgence shouldn’t occupy so much real estate on a tight bill of fare. And while the poussin-foie is now gone, there’s still something retro about the larger framework of the venue, a contemporary Greenmarket restaurant serving two big steaks and two types of caviar while offering just a single vegetarian main.', '“In a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, Gotham Bar and Grill is an outlier,” wrote New York Times critic Sam Sifton in 2011. It was, in his words, a restaurant that celebrated “stability and excellence.” And while the owners in 2019 decided to seek change — a claim backed up by hiring Blamey — Sifton’s assessment still largely holds true.', 'Portale, in his early reign, ranked among the most influential and envelope-pushing New American chefs. In the mid-’80s, he acted as an early champion of seasonal, local fare. And more famously, he built dishes vertically, constructing seafood salads as if they were edible Marie Antoinette wigs. But even as Gotham trended more internationalist in the 21st century, its influence waned amid the brash, stripped-down small-plates era of the aughts and beyond.', 'The acquisition of a younger chef, who built a reputation for whimsical and inventive tavern fare at Chumley’s, could have been an opportunity for a full reset. But notwithstanding a touch of high acid here, a bit of Maine uni there, and smart smattering of chiles everywhere, it’s not clear this is truly Blamey’s establishment. Gotham very much remains Gotham, minus any long-faded excellence.', 'Counterclockwise, from top left: Patrons dining under puffy chandeliers; chef Victoria Blamey plating a dish during service; beef tartare underneath crispy tendon; diners perusing the menu in the rear dining area', 'Yes, the dishes are new, but this is still a big restaurant with big portions, big prices, a bar longer than some entire East Village restaurants, a lounge menu with an epic crab galette, and a fortified host stand operated by four people who look like they spearhead J.P. Morgan’s private wealth management division.', 'On the way to your table, you pass under puffy fabric chandeliers, past a party of five guys (each of them wearing blue-collared button-downs), past three gray-haired men in suits (two of them order the foie), and up and down a few stairs. A waiter is quick to mention they are sold out of the $90 caviar, and can only offer the $140 version.', 'Sometimes the food feels in sync with both new and old gastronomy. The kitchen laces beef tartare with confit tomato, showers it with fluffy gran queso, and tops it off with a wavy tendon chicharon. The layering recalls the altitude of Portale’s architectural tuna tartare, but in a way that’s distinctly, well, Blamey. ', 'But on those rare occasions when the menu feels loose and modern, the service takes a strange and stodgy turn. If a party of three has one man and two women, should a host really ask: “Will the gentleman sit in the middle?” Should servers say things like, “I’ll bring a cocktail list for the lady?” Should a waiter really ask me, the only male at the table, about whether to clear the wine list after a female companion does all the ordering? Should he make eye contact only with me when asking to clear a course? Does Gotham require that certain staffers follow Robert’s Rules of Order (1876) in addressing guests by the third person? If so, Ryan Sutton doesn’t like it.', 'A modern restaurant seamlessly weaves meat-free (or meat-light) dishes into its offerings, prompting diners of all stripes to order them without qualms. Gotham instead sends out dishes that can feel like obligatory concessions to those with dietary restrictions. Beet kimchi ribbons, tomato, and trout roe sit over a pile of stracciatella doing a bland impression of cream cheese. The result is a preparation that tastes like a failed take on a 1980s chevre and beet salad. ', 'Lapsang souchong adds a whisper of smokiness to Japanese eggplant with Sea Island peas, but for naught. The dish is simply a bland, mushy mess (though on another visit, it boasts a more complex roundness and tang). Pea dal, in turn, sit in a rich bath of coconut milk and curry leaf oil. It’s a preparation that begs for naan or rice — or really anything to placate the grainy wallop. At Gotham, it comes with nothing. It is simply a thick, gritty, unbalanced stew of legumes, an incomplete side dish posing as a composed appetizer.', 'The good news, however, is that the sole vegetarian entree showcases Blamey at her best. She chars Caraflex cabbage, drenches it in brown butter, pairs it with a seaweed gremolata, and throws everything over firm beads of fregola pasta. The dish is a striking blend of starch, smoke, restrained fat, and buzzing savoriness.', 'Ruth Reichl, in her own three-star review over two decades ago, described the mains as “straightforward,” a qualifier that still feels apt in 2019. Madai (sea bream) expresses itself as a run-of-the-mill, “here’s a clunky slab of overcooked fish” over a zingy green tomato and poblano sauce. Better is slow-cooked lamb shoulder. It shows off the animal’s agrarian musk with greater degree than most fancy spots, while a calabrian chile sauce lights the palate ablaze. It would be a perfect four-bite starter. As a more Herculean main, though, it feels burdensome.', 'And then there’s the foie gras-laced poussin, whose breast mimicked the texture of overcooked tofu dragged through sand.', 'At the bar, a shorter collection of dishes shows off the calculated risk-taking that Blamey was renowned for at Chumley’s. Her spreadable boar rillette packs equal parts funk and heat; it is like an American answer to ’nduja. She stuffs smoked sturgeon into little “everything” eclairs for an haute hat tip to Ashkenazi appetizing traditions (currently off the menu). She douses raw scallops in citrus and granada chile, resulting in what might be the city’s most wonderfully pungent and peppery ceviche. ', 'The true showstopper is the crab galette, a riff on the traditional chupe stew of Chile, Blamey’s native country. A puffy disc of pastry yields to a thick layer of pulled Dungeness meat. The flesh is laced with chartreuse, tomato, and chile. While an ordinary crabcake often feels lethargic on the palate, her pie hums with acid, spice, and the rich taste of the sea. On a good night, at least. A repeat sampling resulted in more muted flavors.', 'For dessert, consider the souffle. No denser than soft meringue, it shows off a whiff of perfumed peach, checked by the farmer’s funk of tart sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream. A tarte tatin for two does everything that’s expected of it, employing soft, flaky, buttery pastry as a conveyance mechanism for bouncy, caramelized, autumnally aromatic apples. ', 'But pain perdu, alas, functions as a pedestrian elevation of the classic French toast dish, albeit for $15. It feels like a dessert that could come from any fancy restaurant from 2009 or 1999. And that pretty much sums up Gotham. The establishment isn’t so much moving the culinary scene forward as it is acting as an ode to itself. For a restaurant of a certain age and its patrons, that’s probably okay. Let them eat foie gras.', 'Cost: Starters at $17-$29; mains at $27-$55; most desserts at $15. Those prices exclude caviar ($90-$140), steak for two ($135), the souffle ($22), and the tarte tatin for two ($28). Expect to spend about $125-$150 per person in the main dining room, and a bit less in the bar room.', 'Sample dishes: Scallop ceviche, foie gras with seaweed and truffle gelee, beef tartare with tendon, charred eggplant with Sea Island pea, Elysian fields lamb shoulder, Caraflex cabbage, peach souffle with sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream.', 'Bonus tip: The restaurant is reasonably busy, and sometimes packed, on any given night, but the expansiveness of the space means that same-day tables aren’t too tough to come by on Resy; Gotham also accommodates walk-ins both at the bar and the dining room.']"
3,"['Desi tacos and cumin-laced guacamole are executed well at the clubby restaurant, but service issues hold back the former Indian Accent chef', 'Here’s the scene on a recent night at GupShup, a hip new Indian restaurant that has attracted the likes of actor Anupam Kher and comedian Jimmy Fallon. Bollywood movies show at the upstairs bar while thumping club music — not so much the dancing kind as the anonymous variety familiar from a duty-free cosmetics store — fills the dining room. A large group of Elite Yelpers, distinguished by their very cool nametags, are mingling, swirling red wine, and hovering too close to our table. My party has been waiting for the first course to show up, but when a server finally swings by, she brings something a bit less expected: a beverage bill from the downstairs bar. ', '“It would be great if you could settle up,” she says. How welcoming.', 'Ten minutes later, a waiter ferries over a tray filled with guacamole, tacos, ramen, and other fusiony fare that wouldn’t feel out of place at a clubstaurant like Tao or Vandal. That reality extends to the cocktail list. Anyone who orders the house mule, a watery mix of Grey Goose, turmeric, ginger, and lavender, will have to ask for an “Ayurvedic Jackass.” ', 'It’s all enough to make one wonder: Is it not odd that chef Gurpreet Singh, whose eye for nuance made Indian Accent one of the city’s more exhilarating fine dining experiences, is channeling the ubiquities (and ignominies) of the modern food world? It is odd — until you start eating.', 'Guacamole, at first glance, is indistinguishable from other excellent versions elsewhere. Cooks mash the avocados to order with green chiles and cilantro — nothing out of the ordinary. ', 'But a few subtle tweaks make the dish stand out. Cooks lace the fruit with cumin; its sweet musk wafts along the palate. And instead of fried tortillas, GupShup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from Gujarat. And while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. It’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.', 'For “tacos,” Singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. The soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. It conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. You continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of Gramercy.', 'The dining room and the jackfruit tacos', 'There are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of Indian fare in New York. One of them, which includes venues like Chintan Pandya’s Adda and Hemant Mathur’s Sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from Kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). These venues function to remind New Yorkers that South Asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.', 'Singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. Its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of South Asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. One thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of Rahi in Greenwich Village or the foie gras duck haleem of Baar Baar, a frenetic Bowery space with a Buddakan-style vibe.', 'GupShup, by Indian-born restaurateur Jimmy Rizvi (Korali Estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. It finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist Karishma Naran’s mural of a modern Indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.', 'That means Saturday morning avocado toast. The line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether Singh adds anything to the conversation. The chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. It would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. ', 'GupShup’s ramen is another misstep. That’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a Southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. It’s the execution that’s flawed. The ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.', 'Those mistakes aside, Singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. There’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. Or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. Ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. ', 'But just as Momofuku Bang Bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, GupShup’s own evocation, blending Indian sensibilities with Jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. The puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. The tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of Alka Seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.', 'Or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in Delhi. Vendors typically finish it off with butter. Singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. But somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. ', 'Sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. If the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. ', 'Singh, in short, is taking advantage of New York’s thriving globalism to riff on his ancestral cuisine. And if any of this seems a touch off, kindly remember that GupShup is simply deploying the same whimsical eclecticism as its non-Indian peers, from the American restaurant serving Southeast Asian shrimp toast to the Spanish-leaning seafood spot selling Sichuan-style pig ear to virtually any sports bar anywhere in the city hawking tacos.', 'Singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. The kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. Tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.', 'Singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at Indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. Here at GupShup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. It uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.', 'Beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of Kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of New York restaurants. Maybe that will change after more folks try GupShup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. Nizams haleem, a staple of Ramadan iftar dinners in Hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. The humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. ', 'Too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. It came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. Maybe GupShup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? ', 'Weird things tend to happen here. The host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. When someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” The complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.', 'Pre-made desserts, however, are still available if the pastry chef is absent, though it’s not clear whether that’s a good thing. Fig and banana sticky pudding is a study in bland flavors and cold, mealy textures. Cinnamon panna cotta, on two occasions, tastes like what would happen if a kitchen worker thought that the traditional Italian dessert was supposed to flaunt the texture and sweetness of grocery-store cake frosting. ', 'For a Gramercy Park restaurant with operators as experienced as this, one could reasonably expect more polish; the service missteps tend to distract from the food. And that’s too bad, because Singh’s cuisine represents a thrilling chapter in modern New York Indian cuisine.', 'Cost: Starters at $10 to $24; larger dishes at $24 to $46; desserts at $10. Ramen appetizer is $16, or $34 with a lobster tail. Naan is $5-$7; cocktails are $16; chai is $15.', 'Sample dishes: Guacamole with khakra crisps, tomato rasam ramen, smoked salmon puchkas, pulled jackfruit “desi tacos,” chicken tikka, kerala beef fry, tiger prawns.', 'Bonus tip: If you don’t ask a server to course things out, literally all of your food will show up at once; this is even true for solo diners ordering multiple plates.']"
4,"['New York’s luxury seafood market is more crowded than ever, but Eric Ripert and Maguy Le Coze’s Theater District icon remains essential', 'Salmon, in its common New York form, is decidedly unluxurious. Diners more frequently encounter it as a salad protein than as an haute menu item. New York magazine’s Adam Platt once quoted a companion calling it the “Cheerios of restaurant food,” before adding that it was “predictable” and “useless” to critics. In fact, the last time Pete Wells positively used the word salmon in one of his rare four-star reviews was in 2012, when he wrote up Le Bernardin, Eric Ripert and Maguy Le Coze’s French seafood palace in the Theater District. It was a brief mention. I will be less brief. ', 'To understand why Le Bernardin remains one of the city’s most thrilling and technically astute restaurants, a gem of a splurge that won’t drain the bank account as much as other fine dining institutions, do one thing: Get the salmon. ', 'Order it raw with Moroccan seasonings. Neat rectangles of fish sit on the plate like pats of creamsicle-colored butter. They melt on the tongue, releasing warming, musky notes of argan oil and cumin.', 'Order it seared, with a Northern Indian spice blend. Slices of red-hued sea trout — part of the salmon family — nearly fall apart when prodded. They ooze fat, enrobing the mouth in a velvety slick. A dice of roasted tomatoes adds acidic relief, while coriander and garlic impart a sharp piquancy.', 'Order it in pot-au-feu. Chefs place the fish in a shallow pool of water and warm it for just a few minutes, barely firming up the meat. Tableside, a waiter surrounds it with a moat of veal and beef broth, then spoons black truffle butter over it. A whisper of well-done flesh acts as a counterpoint to the wobbly pink filet; its ample oils channel a mouthful of salmon roe. A dose of broth then brings a rush of meaty, earthy balance. Here, the majestic fish is as luxurious as wagyu.', 'Clockwise, from top left: Ran Ortner’s “Deep Water No. 1” oil painting overlooks the dining room; executive chef Eric Gestel and chef Eric Ripert inspect winter truffles; a waiter sauces striped bass tartare; natural light floods the lounge before lunch', 'It’s tempting to write “Le Bernardin has still got it,” but that’s what Michelin declares, without much context, every autumn when it awards yet another set of three stars to the restaurant. The more complex reality is that New York seafood has evolved in the 33 years since Maguy and her late brother, Gilbert, relocated their Parisian restaurant to New York. Namely, there’s a heck of a lot more competition now. Milos came along in 1997 with its jet set lavraki and yacht-friendly prices. Marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. And in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination. Scores of tiny bars, many of them in hip downtown locales, cater to a moneyed clientele seeking (endangered) bluefin in all its fatty forms. ', 'So really, how much culinary relevance can a Times Square-adjacent French spot flaunt as the new decade nears? A lot, as it turns out.', 'Le Bernardin could keep up with any posh omakase joint on its salmon alone. The menu focuses on sustainably minded catches with a breathtaking band of textures and flavors. Langoustines sport a mouthfeel that’s somewhere in between marrow and gelatin. Hiramasa, or amberjack, bleeds luscious oils. And poached skate boasts the soft, ropy mouthfeel of Cuban ropa vieja. Ripert and Eric Gestel, a longtime lieutenant who recently ascended to the position of executive chef, have not served bluefin for over a decade.', 'Another plus is that the menus — $165 for four courses, $198 for a tasting, $228 for a longer meal — are more accessible than those of the city’s most vaunted sushi spots. The beverage program has a generous feel to it as well. Wine director Aldo Sohm offers scores of glasses under $20, including a flinty skin contact grüner veltliner (sound the air raid alarms, there’s finally a natural wine at Le Bern), and a seven-pour pairing at just $95.', 'The room, updated in 2012, still shimmers. A tempestuous painting of the ocean, deep green and bigger than my studio apartment, still lines the back wall. Leather banquettes coddle patrons seemingly dressed for a black tie charity ball. Patrons who only follow the (absurd) rule of “jackets required” will nonetheless find themselves wondering whether they should’ve donned a tux. A team of largely female sommeliers, an outlier in this male-dominant field, glide across the room with airy zalto stems and silver tastevins —  shallow cups used to check the color and clarity of wine.', 'Waiters rush to tables carrying pots of sauce. Lots of sauce; up to 30 different ones on any given day. They aren’t so much a performative flourish as they are the cornerstone of any dish, conveying endless layers of aroma, acid, meatiness, and creaminess. The result is a visual style that can veer closer to “rustic shallow soup” than “built for Instagram,” but none of that matters once you start eating. And slurping.', 'Any hot broth is the fine work of Vincent Robinson, a saucier who’s plied his craft for over thirty years here. Saucing is a famously fickle aspect of gastronomy — these fragile potions can collapse if you look at them the wrong way — and yet Robinson operates with the precision of a physicist working a particle collider.', 'Take that hiramasa again. It’s too rich by itself. Gestel, riffing on a light Japanese stew called nabe, adds tiny shrimp for sweetness and matsutake for a whiff of pine. Then, a pool of lemongrass dashi amps up the entire thing — accentuating the seafaring flavor while toning down the oil.', 'In a peekytoe crab dish, one must concentrate, almost pray, to sense the subtle coastal aromas. It needs help, just not a lot. So the kitchens adds a light shellfish sauce, with a hint of fragrant coconut curry that only seems to magically appear when you whisper the word fenugreek to yourself three times.', 'Ripert has long displayed a fascination with Asia, but over the past decade Le Bernardin has espoused a nautical globalism rivaled only by the more casual Saint Julivert. In 2019, that translates as sharp, salmon-y hat tips to India and North Africa. It also means a transatlantic take on the Spanish speaking world. The cooks sear octopus to a bouncy crunch — nothing unexpected there. Then the flavor station throws in a swatch of mole poblano, a few shoots of cilantro, and a pour of Spanish chorizo sauce. The flavor is sweet, grassy, and nutty at first, before giving way to a deep smokiness. Aldo then swings by with a half glass of Navazos Niepoort ($15), a non-fortified fino that cleanses the palate with a tongue-scrubbing yeastiness.', 'Decades before neighborhood brasseries were putting sea urchin on flatbread pizza, a young Le Bernardin offered it baked in the shell with its own juices. “It smacks of the sea,” Craig Claiborne wrote in 1986. Thirty years later, Le Bernardin continues to embrace strong flavors, sometimes dipping into levels of heat, oil, and funk uncommonly seen in even new tasting menu spots.', 'Take the geoduck, a staple at Cantonese seafood spots but rarely encountered at ritzy French hangouts. Le Bernardin slices the phallic shelled beast into paper-thin rounds. This past August, it arrived simply with a few slices of cucumber and jalapeño. The mollusk snapped with a scallop-like sweetness, before exuding a tang that recalled fresh clam washed in tidal foam. And then the chile kicked in, jolting the palate with a capsaicin kick that would be aggressive even by hot wing standards.', 'Toward the end of the meal, a server brings over the surf and turf of the century: a cube of wagyu and another of Hawaiian walu. The steak expresses a level of beefiness that recalls a Shake Shack burger, while the texture mimics that of silken tofu. The walu, improbably firmer than its bovine counterpart, packs luscious oils and grill char; it is as delicious and complex as a slab of more regal tuna belly.', 'If only the calamari had as much pep and zip. Stuffed squid with romesco shows didn’t rise above the level of a similar, cheaper dish at a tapas bar. Just the same: the caviar atop tuna carpaccio exhibits such a mild flavor one could eat it and not know it was caviar. That miss would likely feel tougher on the four-course menu, where it commands a $50 supplement. And while I’ve never had an a la carte dinner here that was anything less than outstanding, the laws of percentages dictate that the sting of a flop is felt more greatly over a shorter meal.', 'Keep in mind that Le Bernardin’s waiters can operate with a retro formality that doesn’t always keep pace with the modern food or uber-cool wine service. Staffers might apply the honorifics “monsieur” and “madame” with such frequency — more so than anywhere I’ve dined in the Francophone world — that you half expect a singing tea kettle and dancing candelabra to accompany the desserts. ', 'Appropriately, those sweets are as playful as a cartoon.', 'Pastry chef Thomas Raquel, taking inspiration from the trompe l’oeil works of Albert Adria, will trick you into thinking there’s a real apple on your plate. There is not. Instead, Raquel surrounds a core of apple confit with brown butter mousse before hand painting and glazing the sphere to look like a tiny McIntosh. The feeling of cutting into fruit and finding cream is a dream that every child on earth should one day experience. ', 'As for the mignardises, the chocolate dome tastes like a Junior Mint and the pate de fruit packs so much tart passionfruit one wouldn’t be faulted for mistaking this as a Sour Patch Kid. The lesson, of course, is that majestic dishes don’t have to be stereotypically fancy or mild to reach their apex. Sometimes, you can get by with salmon.', 'Cost: Dinner at $165 for four a la carte courses (three savory), $198 for a seven-course tasting ($293 with wine pairings), $228 for an eight-course tasting ($373 with pairings). There is also a $170 vegetarian tasting menu. Lunch is three courses (two savory) for $93. Diners in the lounge can order a $60 City Harvest three-course menu.', 'Sample dishes: Langoustine with seaweed matsutake salad and dashi; peekytoe crab cake with sweet curry sauce; Faroe Islands salmon with black truffle pot-au-feu; Hiramasa with lemongrass-infused bouillon; octopus with chorizo and mole sauce; Hawaiian walu with Japanese wagyu; apple with brown butter mousse and armagnac sabayon.', 'Bonus tip: Reservations can book up at least a month out, but the full dining room menus, including the tastings, are available to walk-ins at the bar and lounge.']"
5,"['Keith McNally’s restaurant reboot delivers charisma, gold-tinged nostalgia, and a familiar brasserie experience to a changed New York', 'Voila: What was once an entire food hall, with myriad vendors and ample seating, is now a single chic French brasserie with two-hour waits. Welcome to Pastis 2.0, the rebirth of Keith McNally’s downtown gem that you might’ve first learned about (like I did) because Lindsay Lohan and other A-listers were slurping onion soup there in the aughts. The new location, run by mega-restaurateur Stephen Starr, sends out roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers a few blocks away from the old location, which was torn down to make way for a luxury home goods retailer that, on its rooftop, serves roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers. Really, this is a certain segment of New York in a nutshell: more of the same. ', 'The thing is, in the case of Pastis, it’s generally a good kind of same.', 'The first incarnation, which fueled the nightly party that is the Meatpacking District, was born in 1999 as a Balthazar sequel of sorts. It simultaneously functioned as an affordable-ish hangout in an increasingly expensive nabe — remember when Samantha from Sex and the City revealed she paid $7,000 per month in rent here? — and a constant celebrity magnet. The partying was wild at times, but it never truly devolved into the type of Rich Kids of Instagram debauchery that nearby spots became known for; there were no dance-party brunches where magnums of Champagne came with sparklers or where jeroboams (if you don’t know what that is, you can’t afford one) triggered recognition by the DJ.', 'By Meatpacking standards, Pastis was chill and inviting. It still is.', 'When a hip burger spot I no longer patronize turned us away in 2005, Pastis took us in. And so we feasted on bacon-loaded tripe and drank Stoli orange martinis (woof). Things are a touch more crowded these days; a line of aspirants regularly snakes toward the door. No reservation? You’ll get quoted a multi-hour wait, though a host concedes that they hold back tables for regulars. ', 'Now you know: Be a regular. Or be here at lunch when it’s quieter. Or be famous. ', 'The second coming, like the first, remains a brilliantly fashionable place to people-watch. Why hello there, Dan Abrams and ex-Men’s Health dude-itor Dave Zinczenko (or his doppelganger), bro-ing it up in a booth. Such antics are more enjoyable than the filet au poivre, which is sometimes grayish and medium when ordered medium-rare, sometimes cold and blue when ordered rare. But the creamy pepper sauce covers up the flaws well enough, and oh, wait, is that John Mayer? At a table surrounded by women? Sounds about right. Let me munch on some bland king crab, and whoa, gosh, what a nice mop of hair that Mayer boy has. Another $16 daiquiri? Sure, why not.', 'The space is a near replica of the old one, from the worn wood planks to the dark banquettes to the zinc bar to every other detail that suggests the venue is 40 years old and not a few months young. McNally, who recently quipped that people go out to eat to escape their spouses, has hung so many artfully worn mirrors that getting caught cheating here is assured. Buy me a hard seltzer one day, and I’ll tell you about the nearby celebrity cuddled up to a person who was not their spouse. ', 'That duo, with their aristocratic cheekbones, looked fabulous. So did everyone else. Anyone who’s dined at McNally’s restaurants knows they’re lit in a very particular type of gold, a hue that suggests that, somewhere in France, a quaint town exists where it is perpetually twilight. On a recent evening, after a glass of muscadet, I reached for a carafe filled with what appeared to be more of the precious liquid. Alas, it was a jug of water, magically turned to wine by amber bulbs that make everything soft and fuzzy.', 'Pastis, in short, looks, feels, and tastes like the old Pastis. Or the current Balthazar. It is a piece of nostalgia for an era that still exists, and for a type of food that is neither threatened nor in short supply. ', 'Starr seems like a logical partner. He runs some of the city’s most distinctive and ambitious Gallic spots, fueling the haute throwback ways of Daniel Rose’s Le Coucou and the classic-modern cafe vibes of Marie-Aude Rose’s La Mercerie. Pastis, of course, is neither distinctive nor ambitious. It sends out basic, mostly well-executed brasserie fare. There is a pedigreed chef, but there is no bio on the website, no waiters who speak about him in reverent tones. They simply tell you how awesome the croque madame is. It is awesome. The haute ham and cheese sandwich — fat slices of toasted brioche, salty jambon, gooey Gruyere, and a sunny-side-up egg — functions as effectively at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.', 'Pastis has “devised a menu so traditional that virtually every dish could qualify for protection by the French Ministry of Culture,” New York Times food critic William Grimes wrote in 2000. The statement could as easily apply to the 2019 offerings: tangy beef tartare, cardboard shrimp cocktail, nutty trout almandine, cloying, one-note bouillabaisse that tastes like it never met saffron. And snails. ', 'The snails are hot. They sit in little tubs of oil that bubble at the table. To watch someone consume an escargot too quickly is to watch the real-life version of Wile E. Coyote swallowing an ACME bomb. Let them cool, then let them squish around in your mouth like the amphibious garlic sponges that they are.', 'Those who order tuna ravigote will be no less pleased. A crimson circle of raw fish nearly takes up the circumference of a plate, lying underneath a verdant pile of mint, tarragon, basil, chive, and dill. Herring, by contrast, tells its story more rustically, as a series of masterfully butchered slices matched with halved potatoes. It is a fine study in salt, smoke, and maritime gelatins.', 'Should you order the roast chicken? Probably. The aggressive brining leaves the breast with a faintly springy texture, but after dredging the meat through rich jus, you won’t notice such details. The pairing is a giant bowl of mashed potatoes, equally buttery and starchy. But best of all are the lobster frites. The chefs roast a two-pound lobster, rip out its meat, drizzle it with about three pounds of garlic butter, and garnish it with fries for dunking. It tastes the way a good lobster should: like a sweetened version of the Atlantic ocean.', 'For dessert, order baba au rhum. A quenelle of cream looks like a cumulus cloud that’s about to be munched by an oblong Pac-Man cake. This being baba, the cake is naturally doused in rum. Lots of rum. I’ve had baba just about everywhere, and can say without qualms that this is the only place where there is enough booze leftover to do a half a shot from the bowl. One feels buzzed afterwards.

Expect to spend about $100 or more per person after drinks, tax, and tip.', 'Sample dishes: Tuna crudo, steak tartare, onion soup, snails with garlic butter, lobster frites, trout amandine, grilled lamb steak, filet au poivre.', 'Bonus tip: If the hosts quote a multi-hour wait, tell the bartender you’re looking to dine; the wait shouldn’t be longer than an hour. Otherwise, scan Resy for cancellations. Also keep in mind that Pastis might just be closed for an unannounced private event the night you show up.', '']"
6,"['Japanese skewers with classically French sauces reign at Maison Yaki, chef Greg Baxtrom’s second restaurant in Prospect Heights', 'The outdoor garden at Maison Yaki, a French-Japanese mashup in Prospect Heights, smells of charred meat and fresh wood. Servers ferry charcoal-grilled skewers slathered with sauces that bear names like maltaise and allemande, while the backyard deck radiates the pungency of sunbaked cedar. Two humans in shorts play pétanque, an old Provençal game similar to bocce. They take turns throwing steel balls, politely raking the gravel after each round, sometimes hitting the back wall where tiny strings of lights intertwine with creeping vines. And then, after a few minutes, a bearded host invites them back in for dinner.', 'On this evening, Maison Yaki is only a Slip’n’Slide short of qualifying as summer camp. And yet, the backyard acts as one of the most civilized waiting rooms in New York. ', 'Fans of Olmsted, a garden-equipped sister spot across the street, know a thing or two about waits and reservations. Maison Yaki, a casual spot where literally every dish falls under $10, improbably boasts some of the same inconveniences as Olmsted, giving away its best tables a month in advance; the only availability three Saturdays from now is at 10:00 p.m. But the little secret is that the kitchen serves the full menu out back. Waiters balance the crispy beef tongue katsu sandwiches on ledges, right by the two pétanque courts. ', 'As I wait for a friend one evening, I order a skewer of king trumpet mushrooms a la greque; the namesake lemon-wine sauce brightens up the meatiness of the fungi. At this point, the sky is starting to darken, and I’m cooling off with a fragrant yuzu gin & tonic. In this era where even an informal dinner can be planned with the precision of a Google Calendar invite, and secured with the threat of a Resy-backed financial penalty ($25 per person here), it’s nice to simply walk into a joint and eat standing up while playing alcohol-fueled lawn games.', 'A patron plays pétanque; a spread of dishes', 'Chef Greg Baxtrom, late of Stone Barns, has himself another winner here in Prospect Heights. And the good news is that the wait to dine indoors is much shorter here than at Olmsted, thanks to a 50/50 split between walk-ins and reservations. Kitchen counter seats overlooking the smoldering charcoals, or bar stools underneath the mini-indoor mushroom farm, turn over reasonably quickly on weeknights. ', 'Evenings here trend more affordable as well. Draft cocktails, including wonderfully strong Manhattans and martinis, cost $9. A full meal for one — two small plates, five skewers, two drinks, tax, and tip — will run about $80, versus $115 or so at Olmsted. That’s not cheap anywhere, especially not in a neighborhood where the median household income hovers around $62,000 per year. ', 'But relatively speaking, the prices are reasonable enough for a style of cross-cultural dining that doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the city. Maison Yaki is a cross between a French bistro and a Japanese yakitori spot, and most of the time, it’s a darn good one at that. ', 'For traditional rillettes — confit meat in a jar — a thick cap of white fat helps preserve the slow-cooked proteins. But in the fanciful world of Maison Yaki, a layer of wasabi-ginger foam, doing its best impression of lard, sits above a mound of shredded duck leg. The frothy tweak cuts through the poultry funk with finesse.', 'The history of French-Japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. Most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. Joël Robuchon’s chain of L’Ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. And oodles of modern Japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.', 'But yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. Their cuisines are more codified. That doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. A bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-English names. The same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.', 'What’s particularly clever about Maison Yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. Snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. Baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. Chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; Baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and Franco-style braised artichokes.', 'Chicken breast nuggets are typically paired with wasabi at yakitori spots. Here, Baxtrom douses the little bites, whose stunningly squishy interiors recall ripe grapes, in sauce allemande — essentially Thanksgiving gravy.', 'This isn’t contemporary globalism; this is classic fusion. Almost every Japanese-leaning dish has a striking French accent and vice versa. And the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. A Korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an American steakhouse. A pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. And a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. The lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which Baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce Americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest Gallic seafood soups.', 'From top left: The dining room at Maison Yaki; chef Greg Baxtrom with shiso snails; scallop skewers with sauce maltaise; Max Katzenberg, co-owner and general manager', 'That’s not to say Maison Yaki couldn’t use a bit of work. The kitchen doesn’t always display the same technical prowess with Japanese grilling as it does with French-style saucing. This is not unexpected for a young venue. Cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. Watching a senior yakitori chef (or Uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. They tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.', 'The binchotan station at Yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. Gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. Baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. The sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. The squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss. Well, except when the meat is overcooked.', 'You’re Invited to the Eater Young Guns Summit', 'Then there are leeks. They’re seared past the point of no return, essentially vegetarian mush on a stick. What saves the preparation is a vichyssoise sauce (a blend of potato and more leeks), adding a hit of bright, creamy buzz to the soft allium.  ', 'Skewered pork belly arrives hidden underneath a foamy dijonnaise, adding just enough tang to balance the richness of the swine. If only the swine exhibited the silky fats and crispy flesh that normally make pig belly so compelling. These are simply firm, hot cubes of meat. ', 'One might logically ask about all the offal that typically define the modern yakitori spot. For now, items like gizzards and hearts only appear as specials, which is too bad because those off-cuts and viscera provide something that Yaki could do better with: texture. ', 'The variegated mouthfeels one experiences at venues like Tori Shin — thanks to snappy knee bones and rubber band-like arteries — help break up the fact that you’re essentially eating a whole lot of hot, fatty meat. Baxtrom’s old-school saucery, which harkens back to the era of Careme and Escoffier, serves a similar purpose, which is to achieve a sense of balance. But still, it would be nice if more of the skewers exhibited more than the soft or faintly chewy textures that dominate a meal here. ', 'There are worse verdicts, of course, than chomping down on a pillowy duck meatball. The kitchen doesn’t lace it with tiny bits of bone, as is the norm; the fluffiness puts it closer to an Italian meatball than a Japanese one. You dip the succulent poultry into a ramekin of soy and what looks like yolk. Turns out the egg is really an avant-garde sphere of fruit puree that pops with the poke of a chopstick. “Duck a l’orange,” the menu says. Very cool. Equally cool is Yaki’s rare textural masterpiece, two chicken wings on a skewer. The skin shatters like the top of a creme brulee, while the silky flesh underneath yields with more ease. ', 'This is the appropriate way to end a meal here. Baxtrom didn’t initially employ a pastry chef at Olmsted, an omission he managed to pull off thanks to a masterpiece of frozen yogurt. And while there’s now a chef dedicated to sweets, the team hasn’t yet found that killer finisher here at Yaki, so for now you can skip the mealy Japanese cheesecake or run-of-the-mill profiteroles. Those who want to extend their stay can kick the dirt out in the backyard with a martini and a few steel balls.', 'Cost: All items are $10 or less. Dinner for two should run about $150 after tax and tip.', 'Sample dishes: Baguette with yuzukosho butter, chawanmushi with summer truffle and artichoke barigoule, escargot in shiso butter, beef tongue katsu sandwich, asparagus with béarnaise, lobster with sauce Américaine, chicken breast and sauce allemande, duck a l’orange.', 'Bonus tip: Even though the best tables book out far in advance, about half the restaurant is reserved for walk-ins. Waits are more reasonable than at Olmsted — and sometimes non-existent in the later or early hours —\xa0but can hit 90 minutes at prime time.', 'Update: An earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that Olmsted and Maison Yaki do not employ a pastry chef. They now do.']"
7,"['The famous Chicago import is indulgent to a fault, and not nearly worth the wait that it commands at its Tribeca location', 'To observe the flattop at Au Cheval, the New York spinoff of Brendan Sodikoff’s Chicago burger palace, is to witness black steel turn pink. The cooks here do not tend to verdant asparagus or springtime ramps; rather, they traffic in flesh, blood, and marrow. Beef patties and pork belly cover the griddle with such density that an intrepid cat could walk across without burning its paws. It is a carpet of meat. An Angus rug that sizzles. These burgers are why otherwise rational humans subject themselves to an inordinately long wait before dinner. ', 'The Tribeca hotspot offers two optional toppings: a fried egg and a layer of pepper bacon — the kind that’s cut so thick it could stand alone as an appetizer. Those add-ons are for those who want, to borrow the words of a waiter, “the Instagram burger.” ', 'I want no such thing. Twenty minutes later, my server sends over the standard model: two seared patties. They boast a handsome maillard char and a midlevel bovine punch. American cheese — or as I like to call it, yellow salt — folds itself into the brown nooks and crannies. This all goes into a golden brioche bun slicked with dijonnaise. It is a tasty burger. Then again, there is no shortage of tasty burgers in New York. That’s worth keeping in mind when a host says it’s going to be 90 minutes before you sit down.', 'Also worth keeping in mind: The signature item runs $27 with fries, placing it firmly within gourmet burger territory. Add the suggested toppings and you’re at $35, which places it alongside the DB burger as one of the city’s priciest. But while Boulud’s truffle- and foie gras-stuffed specimen is a veritable act of expert charcuterie, the Au Cheval burger, with all the fixins, is a gloppy, runny, everything-falls-out-when-you-bite-it expression of American junk food. It’s not quite in the same league as its peers.', 'Back in 2010, when the iPhone was still in its infancy, Apple sent developers a rather famous set of guidelines. “If your app doesn’t do something useful or provide some form of lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted,” the tech giant wrote, adding, “We don’t need any more fart apps.”', 'The city’s restaurant scene would benefit from a similar set of guidelines. To wit: Our New York doesn’t really need any more classic steakhouses or expensive burgers. There’s something positively head-spinning about a well-funded operator looking out over the cityscape and declaring, Gosh, New York could really use a few more ribeyes and Pat LaFrieda blend patties. And yet here’s Thomas Keller, bestowing Manhattan with a carbon copy of his Miami chophouse at Hudson Yards, and there’s Sodikoff, giving Tribeca a near replica of his Windy City spot.', 'The indulgent menu is nearly identical to the original; the only real difference is the digs. The room is smaller in Chicago, and the service is efficient. Here in New York, the ceilings are high enough and the booths are roomy enough to suggest a grand brasserie or prix fixe spot. Sodikoff, who made his New York debut with the ultra-exclusive 4 Charles Prime Rib (good luck getting a reservation before 11:45 p.m.), bills this as a diner. If that truly were the case, it would heed the cue of MeMe’s or Gertie’s, two venues that seek to rethink that dying form with a mix of nostalgia, generosity, and egg creams.', 'Sodikoff’s use of the term feels more ironic than honest. Is “diner” really the right description for a venue that books up between 5 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.? Where a host says “we’ll text you,” rather than invite you to hang out in the downstairs bar? Where the lighting is as dim as at a nightclub? Where food isn’t delivered as platters with sides, but rather ordered a la carte, as at a steakhouse? ', 'In a city where affordability and accessibility feel under assault at every angle, “diner” isn’t a term worth ceding ground on.', 'Au Cheval’s food — unlike the bright, high-acid fare of the past few years — functions as a throwback to the fatty aughts or a hat tip to Chicago’s historic affinity for meat. The single burger comes with two patties and the double comes with three. Fried bologna is piled as high as a mini kakigori. Vegetarians don’t have much to work with here, save a not quite palate-cleansing green salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, or an omelet stuffed with too much chevre. Herbivores can also pretend the fries aren’t crisped in beef fat. ', 'One might justify this as bucking trends, or as “transgressive cooking,” as my colleague Robert Sietsema put it. I’d counter that the prevailing philosophy at Au Cheval is to ignore accepted principles of good cooking, or of what normal stomachs and bodies can handle. That said, here’s what to order and what to avoid. ', 'Chilaquiles: Traditionally, the dish consists of tortilla chips simmered in salsa. That much is true here, except Au Cheval stacks everything high and adds sour cream, guacamole, egg, and jalapenos. The chips and toppings are arguably more in conversation with American nachos than the Mexican staple, but it doesn’t suffer from the fusion-y sensibilities. The salsa is applied generously enough to offset all the richness.', 'General Jane’s Fried Chicken: A whole bird lacquered up in a honey-soy-ginger glaze. The exterior color recalls the dark, molasses-like hue of Pok Pok’s fish sauce wings, albeit with a touch less balance or complexity. Each bite yields a hefty crunch and tender flesh, with some of the fattier bits giving off a deep, poultry kick. Sprigs of cilantro keep the rampant sweetness in check, if only barely.', 'Eggs with foie gras: A moat of tawny shallot-sherry gravy spills across mounds of soft yellow curds. This isn’t a study in contrasts, but rather an essay in amplification; the eggs enrich the sauce, while the sauce adds salty, umami oomph to the eggs. The only thing that’s out of place are the knobs of foie gras, which are overcooked and only serve to pump up your bill. The cost is $28.', 'Root beer float: This concoction is more of a parfait, with interspersed layers of ice cream and soda. The result is a sundae that’s easier to eat than most floats; diners aren’t tasked with attacking a single globule of frozen dairy bobbing up and down as it melts. The root beer, incidentally, packs an assertive sarsaparilla sucker punch.', 'Mille-feuille: Pastry cream as thick as cheesecake sits between layers of puff pastry the color of milk chocolate. It is an excellent American tweak to the French classic. ', 'The Chicken Bar', 'Located down a flight of stairs, just before the restrooms, the Chicken Bar is where to pass an hour or so while you wait for a Friday-night table. The red-hued lighting\xa0is bewildering and blinding at first, but your eyes will adjust (though your phone’s camera will not). Here’s how to roll like a pro down here:', 'Drink a Painkiller. Bartenders pour the frozen Tiki cocktail into tiny plastic water cups. The soothing, silky mixture of rum, pineapple, orange, and coconut efficiently cleanses the palate of the aggressively seasoned fried chicken. ($14)', 'Try a hot chicken sando. The downstairs kitchen fries up three chicken fingers, seasons them with cayenne, ancho, and gochujang, and places them each inside a comically tiny bun. The poultry packs an intense salinity and an impressive crunch, and while the heat level is mild, a dose of Crystal hot sauce, available at the bar, should get the job done. ($10)', 'Avoid the bacon cheese fries. There’s not much going on here, just a pile of bland fries with underseasoned and underspiced bacon chili and cheese sauce. ($10)', 'Fries: The fries at Au Cheval have received the type of breathless praise that one would expect to see hanging above a Broadway marquee. Let me be brief here: They are fine. Sometimes they are crispy; sometimes they are not. The beef tallow adds no distinctive flavor or aroma.', 'The burger: A perfectly respectable burger, though a touch pricey at $27 with fries (or $18 without). The bacon-and-egg burger provides impressive flavors as well, but it’s a drippy, unstructured mess.', 'Hash browns with duck hearts: This isn’t a typical shaved potato hash; Au Cheval instead uses diced and roasted potatoes. The crispiness factor is more subdued. In any case, cooks slather the nuggets in mornay and duck gravy. This would be a reasonably nourishing dish at a roadside diner in, let’s say, Montana, after a long day of skiing and hunting elk. But one might argue such organ-y and carb-y indulgences don’t quite jibe with a hot and humid New York summer.', 'Broiled salmon: This is the sole fish option here. The kitchen, rather than letting the fish express its luxuriant oils, sends out a well-done slab of salmon. The menu promises brown butter and black pepper, neither of which are apparent on the product that arrives. The flesh has the texture of well-done tuna fish and comes with a side of what the waiter eagerly describes as “steak salt.” It tastes like any salt.', 'Chevre omelet: A classic demilune of scrambled eggs, folded over goat cheese and red bell peppers. This isn’t a bad pairing, per se, but the eggs are infused with such an obscene amount of butter and salt that the palate craves acidity, be it a zingier cheese or tart oven-roasted tomatoes. Instead, the chevre adds fat and the pepper adds sugar. It is a study in too much.', 'Bologna sandwich: The key to a good fried bologna sandwich is imparting the mortadella with a mid-level char, causing the edges to curl up like roni cups; the crispy bits act as a counterpoint to the meat’s intrinsic sweetness. Here at Au Cheval, however, the sandwich is simply a pile of warm, nutmeg-laced cold cuts on a bun. A slathering of melted cheese and dijonnaise increase the glop factor. A corner deli could do better.', 'Cost: Excluding the $50 pork porterhouse for two, all dishes are under $30, with many items falling below $20. A standard burger meal, however, can quickly get pricey. The signature item is $18 by itself, $23 with bacon, $26 with a fried egg, and $35 with all of the above, plus fries ($9). Add on two drinks and you’re at nearly $90 for one after tax and tip.', 'Sample dishes: Green salad with pickled shallot, kale Caesar, foie gras with scrambled eggs and toast, fried bologna sandwich, chilaquiles, classic burger, mille-feuille, root beer float.', 'Bonus tip: Tables are released on Resy a week out and get snapped up quickly. Walk-ins during the off hours can face no waits; during prime time, waits can creep up past 90 minutes. Also: consider swinging by just for coffee, be it a pourover or a “military latte” (a creation that’s dusted with matcha and cocoa powder) at the Sawada stand inside.']"
8,"['Pinsa, the thin and crispy pizza famous in Rome, is the specialty here', 'Montesacro Pinseria is a serious Roman restaurant masquerading as a pizzeria. The pizza, of course, is the almost faddish pinsa, an oblong flop of well-browned dough made from a combination of wheat, rice, and soy flour, tracing its roots back to ancient Rome. Part of a mini chain that includes another branch in Portland, the restaurant was founded in San Francisco in 2015, and claims to be the first pinseria in the United States.', 'Our branch — run by owner Gianluca Legrottaglie, chef Riccardo Buitoni, and wine director Emanuele Tibaldo — lies in central Williamsburg, just above the Lorimer L stop on Union Avenue. If the place seems eerily familiar, that’s because it was the former and much-missed bistro DuMont. Now, the front room is quiet and serene, with a bar running along one side and an open kitchen at the end of the room, so open you can reach in and grab a loaf of freshly made bread, warm, moist, and with a dense crumb.', 'But a crooked hallway runs around the kitchen to the place most diners settle down: the covered rear patio. With a black interior and bright spotlights, it feels like an airport runway at midnight. The patio seats 70 or so, and potted plants are scattered here and there. Big tables can be easily pushed together into bigger tables, where groups seeking post-work pizza hunker down, with huzzahs rising up to the retractable ceiling.', 'Let’s ignore the pinsa for a minute. Romans are very fond of variety meats, and evidence of this is a marvelous pig head roulade ($11), composed of smoky and greasy swirls of white fat and pink flesh. There’s also a tripe dish, Roman-style in a cheesy tomato sauce. What’s the difference between it and the famed tripe of Florence? Well, Roman tripe is further seasoned with fresh mint, an herb often seen in Roman cooking. You’ll be seeing more of it at Montesacro.', 'Unless incorporated onto a pinsa, vegetables ($13 to $16) will not be the most memorable aspect of your meal. Most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal Romanesco, also undercooked; and Brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. The notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash. It gets crumbed like tempura, making the mellow orange vegetable crunchy and soft at the same time, and then dribbled with honey and heaped with grated cheese. Get three orders and it could happily be your entire meal.', 'Pastas play an important, if minor, role on the bill of fare, and all I’ve tasted have been unfailingly excellent. Closely associated with Rome, egg-yolky carbonara ($18) shines yellow in its bowl, dotted with cured guanciale in little salty tidbits and poured over mezze maniche, stunted tubules that trap more sauce than the spaghetti traditionally used. The effect is like breakfast bacon and eggs.', 'But make sure you examine the easy-to-miss special menu, which flaps on a tiny slip of paper stapled to the regular one. Special pastas have included potato gnocchi, soft as a winter mitten, mired in a fibrous beef cheek sauce that clings in great globs to the pasta, and burrata-filled ravioli lavished with fresh chanterelles and grated truffle pecorino. At $20 for a substantial serving, how can the restaurant afford to offer it?', 'The five-item list of specials that day was particularly compelling due to its component of fresh mushrooms, served at just the season when they’re harvested in Italy. This is meta-restaurateuring at its best, meaning certain indefinable features besides the food will transport you to Rome. There was also a wild boar chop in a ragu of fresh porcinis, and a pinsa that featured Italian sausage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. A friend and I ordered all three mushroom specials that evening and enjoyed a fungal orgy.', 'There are only three proper secondi: a fish, a steak, and a chicken. The waiter warned us away from the steak, which comes in a salsa verde more appropriate to Florentine cooking. You might choose the crisp-skinned chicken pressed under a brick instead, but conventional entrees here will never be the highlight of your meal.', 'Inevitably, we come to the pinsas. The variety is vast, and the individual diner will pick the pizza with the combination of ingredients that pleases her most. I can see digging the one with broccoli rabe and spicy sausage (Maranella, $20), or the pie that sports tomatoes, fried eggplant, and two kinds of cheese, including the unmeltable ricotta salata (Portonaccio, $19).', 'I selected instead a pinsa that’s assembled after the pie comes out of the oven, making the toppings warm but not hot. You won’t burn your tongue out of eagerness on the Garbatella ($21), which features wads of really great albacore tuna, purple onions, and caper mayonnaise. Yes, it tastes like the world’s best tuna salad sandwich. Another favorite outlier merits a special box by itself on the menu — focaccia der muratore, wherein a thin layer of pinsa dough sheaths slices of mortadella. For bologna lovers, this is pig heaven.', 'Besides pizzeria and Roman restaurant, Montesacro enjoys a further identity as a wine bar. The list has many diverting specimens that would go well with pizza. Unfortunately, many tend to be a little pricey for this usage, including a nero d’Avola and an Etna rosso from Sicily ($60 and $70, respectively), reds with a flinty taste issuing from volcanic soils. Other wines come from Spain, France, Turkey, Slovenia, and Chile, but the one that drinks best with pizza, to my taste, is a fizzy and almost sweet red lambrusco ($48) from the Emilia-Romagna producer Vecchia Modena.', 'On the other hand, you should never be ashamed of eating your pinsa the way Romans often do, with that venerable Roman beverage, Coca-Cola. Only in this case, it will be a bottle of Mexican Coke.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one appetizer, one pinsa, and one pasta, plus two glasses of wine and tax but not tip, $90. ', 'Sample dishes: Porchetta (herby roast pork), zucca frita (delicata squash), Garbatella pinsa (tuna and caper mayonnaise), pollo al mattone (chicken under a brick).', 'What to Drink: Any sparkling wine by the bottle or glass, white grechetto from Lazio, draft pilsner beer, or bottled Spanish cider.', 'Bonus Tip: While you won’t have room, there are some commendable desserts, including a panna cotta flavored with dried fennel, and navel-shaped biscotti that come with a free glass of red wine. Drink and dip.  ', '']"
9,"['Noda and Sushi Noz both execute a pristine, high-end omakase in spite of a clientele that seems insistent on interrupting the zen experience', 'One of the modern truths of New York gastronomy is that eating expensive sushi means witnessing the wealthy carry out their extravagant existences. At Masa, I watched a party of four wolf down $700 worth of wagyu in a minute. “You’ll be able to pay for a year’s worth of flights with the points from this meal,” one of them said to the man stuck with the check. At Ichimura, I saw a group of tourists ignore the fragile nigiri the chef was serving them, letting two or more pieces collect on their plates as they tapped away on their phones. And at Zo, two guys sitting nearby insisted on taking care of our $650 bill. After they did (thank you!), they encouraged us to defraud our company by expensing the dinner anyway. ', 'It’s with these absurdities in mind that one considers Noda in Flatiron and Noz on the Upper East Side. Both rank among the city’s buzziest and most excellent new sushi joints. Both tout traditional edomae services, serving aged raw fish over warm rice, one piece at a time, brushed with little more than nikiri (reduced soy) or maybe a quick grate of yuzu zest. Like some of their peers, both traffic in deliciously predictable, flown-in-from-Japan luxuries, heaping on piles of depleted bluefin as if this were some kind of all-you-can-eat buffet for endangered-species.', 'And at either venue, you’re liable to encounter an increasingly ubiquitous modern character, satirized on Billions. I dub him the Sushi Bro. He does very well for himself. He’ll tell you about every sushi spot he’s ever dined at. And since you’re all stuck at the same counter, he is having dinner with you, whether you like it or not. ', 'From top: Chef Shigeyuki Tsunoda standing behind the sushi bar; a bartender pouring a cocktail; and uni and tofu chawanmushi with caviar', 'Shortly after he kicked off his omakase at Noda last week, a man in a gray suit emitted a subtle “wow” as he ate his silky chawanmushi with uni and caviar. It’s possible I did the same. The white pudding was stunning, enrobing the tongue with its fats and softening the briny blow of the urchin. A few minutes later, as I was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “Wow, they nailed that.” He went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television. ', 'Thing is, we weren’t at the ESPN Zone. We were at a restaurant where two hours of (mostly) spectacular sushi runs $340 after tip. At this tight chef’s counter, lilliputian portions of fish can require closed eyes and mental zen to appreciate their subtleties. As I placed a single bite of o-toro nigiri, a plump slice of fat-oozing tuna belly, into my mouth, my seatmate leaned over and said, “Isn’t that great?” And my concentration was broken. ', 'This isn’t the first time I’ve seen this type of bro-ish behavior at a sushi bar, nor will it be the last. ', 'No other dinner format so reliably packs as many rich type-A folks behind a well-sanded bar and pours them $30 glasses of sake. And no other exorbitant dinner format has grown with the frenzy of sushi since the economic recovery began a decade ago. Over the past five years, New York has seen the debut of at least 10 $300-plus omakase spots, easily outpacing the openings of Western-leaning tasting-menu venues or rococo chophouses. They rank among the power restaurants of choice in 2019, due in no small part to the fact that they convey luxury more quickly than a Gallic tasting, more nimbly than a gut-busting bastion of beef, and often more discreetly than anywhere, thanks to tiny, windowless spaces.', 'That element of mystery abides at Noda. Its owners include Justin Hauser, who used to work for Related, the firm behind Hudson Yards, and David Hess, whose family founded the namesake multibillion-dollar energy corporation. (The duo also run the fast-casual Bondi Sushi next door, where lunch costs less a cocktail at Noda.)', 'Patrons enter by walking into an anonymous office building, past an unmarked door, and into a purple-hued lounge, a posh holding pen that designer Ken Fulk, using the backwards tropes of Orientalism, once described as a “James Bond opium den.” A host pulls back a curtain and escorts everyone to the semi-circular bar, flanked by 10 pink velvet stools. The space more closely recalls an avant-garde cocktail parlor than a traditional sushi spot. ', 'Tsunoda, late of Tokyo’s Sushi Iwa, stands behind the counter, wielding a foot-long knife. He and his team cut knobs of sweet potato into little squares, to pair with earthy lotus root soup. He slices abalone as if it were quartz, letting the jagged edges marinate in a pool of its own juices; the umami-packed one-biter tastes like a brilliant cross between chicken liver and anchovy water. ', 'And then comes the nigiri sushi, distinguished by its otherworldly rice. Once upon a time, nigiri constituted a quick form of preservation. Vinegar, accordingly, is common at any given sushi spot. What sets Noda apart is a more aggressive seasoning level; the tart rice zings the tongue like one of those high-acid salads at Wildair.', 'That vinegar adds a touch of punch to golden eye snapper or yellowtail, two cuts that turn out a bit mushy. It also helps tame the musk of Hokkaido uni, whose tidal aroma lingers for a full minute after consumption. And it adds a dose of balance to exceedingly fatty bluefin. The chef slices this breed thicker than others. It doesn’t so much melt as bounce with a supple springiness. But when the fishy oils start to overwhelm, the acid kicks in to lend a proper dose of pucker. ', 'If only the nigiri courses included a wider variety of fish. And if only my enjoyment of the o-toro wasn’t interrupted by bro-man next to me. Yeah, that sounds nitpicky, but think of it this way: A diner gets about 23 bites of steak with a rib-eye, but just a single two-inch bite of any particular fish at a sushi spot. It’s as if someone tried to chat with you during the key plot twist of Jordan Peele’s Us at the movies. You don’t get to hit rewind. Then again, that moment faded a bit when Tsunoda sliced a single bite of tamago. The yellow rectangle dissolved into a pool of custard when consumed, giving off the seafaring scent of gray shrimp. All of a sudden I couldn’t hear anything else around me.', 'If Noda has the air of a dinner party, letting cordial cocktail conversations carry over into the sushi bar, the omakase at Sushi Noz, owned by brothers David and Joshua Foulquier, channels a more formal ballet. The restaurant’s website likens the restaurant to a Kyoto temple, though the chef has also compared his nightly meals, which start at $325, to Kabuki theater. It is performance before a rapt audience. It is meant to be transportive; the restaurant imported over 1,000 pieces of wood from Japan, including the 200-year-old hinoki wood counter. Servers wear full kimonos with slippers.', 'Each of the eight patrons remains silent as the chef, a native of Hokkaido, greets every diner with a bow. When he starts to prep — lacing his rice with pungent vinegar, grilling eel over coal and bamboo leaves, or dismembering a live king crab while it’s staring at you — the level of diner chatter rarely rises above a whisper.', 'From upper left: Chef Nozomu Abe presenting a king crab, searing bluefin cheek, and brushing a slice of fatty tuna sushi with a soy reduction', 'The gently poached crab, almost as light as cotton candy, is spectacular, faintly oceanic at the edges and uniformly sweet within. And for those who think crab is too sugary by itself, anchovy dipping sauce with shiso flowers infuses the meat with the brine of 10 waves. Abe then walks past the diners with a few slices of bonito under a cloudy glass dome. He decloches the platter (ta-da!), filling the room with the scent of smoked hay. The fish itself sports the fragile density of Jell-O, with its skin disintegrating like burnt marshmallow.', 'Noz also offers a $175 nigiri-only experience in the separate “Ash Room.” The mood here is more lively; during a recent visit patrons chatted about flipping homes and drinking grand-cru Burgundies — while ribbing me for ordering a beer.', 'Chef Junichi Matsuzaki produces sushi on par with the more expensive Hinoki Room. Last week, the offerings were slightly less tuna-heavy than next door; they included baby sea bream (tender and glimmering), striped jack (sporting a firm snap), Pacific oyster (marinated until it has no flavor), and a rice hand roll laced with anchovy yolk sauce (ultra-crisp and obscenely rich).', 'Diners can request extra a la carte nigiri here, though four pieces, served over three minutes added $65 to my bill. For those who don’t mind skipping Noz’s excellent composed plates, the Ash Room functions as a fine economy comfort experience.', 'Sushi chefs sometimes like to sate the diner immediately with fat, beginning with a slice of tuna. Abe instead commenced the nigiri course with humble squid. He doesn’t cross-hatch it like some, or jazz it up with citrus like others. He simply presents it as a slick study in the color white — wearing an invisible cloak of sweet soy. The cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an MSG-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess. The rice, while still distinctly tangy, is a touch less vinegared than at Noda. It is more “one” with the fish, rather than distinct.', 'As at Noda, though, the meal overall was technically masterful but left me craving more textural revelations, more varieties of seafood. Dinner quickly devolves into the four bluefin of the apocalypse: marinated akami (nearly dissolves on the tongue), medium fatty chu-toro (luscious and chewy), fatty o-toro (I’ll let you guess what happened), and charcoal-singed cheek (overcooked and bland).', 'Sustainability issues notwithstanding, there’s something depressingly uniform about having to make one’s way through the same four slices of tuna — or five, if you count the inevitable toro hand roll — at a fancy omakase spot, sometimes taking up nearly half the nigiri portion of the meal. That’s not to be disrespectful of the craft; part of the bliss of sushi is akin to the joy of watching Shakespeare, seeing the same stories tweaked ever so gently by different directors. ', 'But to continue the metaphor: Shakespeare wrote a lot of plays, and Abe and Tsunoda — and some of their peers — seem to follow this one particular bluefin script just a little too closely. These practices recall the modern crutch of a Western tasting-menu venue, where so many meals finish with that same hunk of wagyu.', 'Still, I’ll enjoy my o-toro. Or I’ll try. As I’m halfway into my single bite at Noz, the guy next to me — it’s always a guy — decided to ask me “why I eat sushi like that,” as if I could, mid-chew, impart him with some sort of cultural wisdom about how I use my hands to place a piece of food into my mouth. I’d tell you what he was referring to, but that would give credence to a sentient blue blazer watching the way I eat and then interrupting me. Alas, this is sushi in New York.', 'Cost: Dinner is $285, or $342 after 20 percent tip. Dinners are fully prepaid via the Tock reservations service, and they are nonrefundable. Optional sake pairings run $205. Three a la carte drinks will easily cost $90 or so after tip.', 'Sample dishes: Chawanmushi with caviar, grilled scallop wrapped in nori, abalone in its own juices, tamago with gray shrimp, and assorted sushi, including kinmedai, sweet shrimp, lean tuna, medium-fatty tuna, and seared tuna.', 'Bonus tip: Cocktail buffs can visit the bar without committing to the full omakase.', 'Cost: $325 in the Hinoki Room, or $175 in the Ash Room for a shorter sushi-only menu. All prices are service-included; there is no additional line for tipping.', 'Sample dishes: King crab with anchovy sauce and shiso flowers, grilled and smoked bonito, sea perch with rice, and assorted sushi, including squid, wild yellowtail, pike mackerel, all the grades of tuna, and sea eel. Dessert might include super-earthy black sesame pudding.', 'Bonus Tip: Reservations can book up a few weeks out on Tock, but unlike with Noda, patrons can give up their seats a few days ahead of dinner with no financial penalty; this allows for frequent same-week cancellations and availability. Ash Room seats are often easier to come by.']"

The question made a certain degree of sense; Sandler played a fine dining chef in Spanglish. But still, celebrities appear on talk shows to seem relatable; they don’t go on about Lamborghinis or private jets. And yet here was comedy’s T-shirt-and-jeans everyman talking about one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with O’Brien admitting he’d been there too. Sandler even mentioned the owner’s name, Thomas Keller, the American godfather of the $1,000 meal.', 'No other culinary icon is more responsible for raising the bar on how much U.S. diners pay for a single dinner. Other fancy venues had four stars, but in the mid-aughts, Keller had the high-end zeitgeist. He enjoyed high-profile consultancies on that Sandler flick and on Ratatouille. One of his top waiters penned a celebrated memoir about the nightly wizardry at Per Se.', 'The coverage and reviews helped normalize feasts that could last hours and cost as much as a bi-weekly paycheck. Per Se’s success — the Times named it the city’s best restaurant, at least for a while — fueled a new class of extended-tasting-menu spots. Journalist Jodi Kantor argued venues like Per Se contributed to spendier $40 mains across the country. ', 'When Keller raises prices, others follow. This brings us to the case of TAK Room, Keller’s new endeavor at Hudson Yards. Most of its seats are filled on any given night. Its celebrity clientele has been documented by the Hollywood Reporter. But while it nominally specializes in midcentury fare, the true signature dish is more troublesome, both the way it’s executed and the frequency with which it intrudes upon every meal. That dish is the $100 entree. A single dish for one.', 'The $100 entree is not an outlier at TAK Room, a restaurant that largely mimics Keller’s Surf Club in Miami. More than half of the mains will effectively cost that much, after tax and tip. Keller is getting us to spend more, again.', 'Take the ribeye. It isn’t dry-aged, a time-consuming method that may warrant a higher cost; none of the steaks are here. It doesn’t sport the spinalis muscle, arguably the most succulent part of the ribeye, which has been butchered off for no good reason. It doesn’t even exhibit a particularly notable juiciness or beefiness. A spokesperson for the restaurant said the Snake River farms cut should rank from a 9 to 12 on the Japanese scale of marbling, which is about one would expect from ultra-expensive wagyu. In reality, the fattiness and flesh recalled the depth of something from Costco. It costs $106 after adding steak sauce.', 'Or contemplate the prime rib. “Two can share it, but it’s meant for one,” a waiter tells me. It costs $110 (or $142 post-gratuities and the like). Keller himself drops by to slice it, shearing off a slab that’s as thick as a lean paperback novel. He douses the mid-rare meat in enough jus to coat every inch of the meat and the plate’s inner rim.', 'Tax and 20 percent tip have been added.', 'Lamb chops + sauce: $106', 'Ribeye + sauce: $106 ', 'Dover sole:  $110', 'Lobster Thermidor: $110', 'Filet mignon + sauce: $119', 'Prime rib: $142', 'Short rib Wellington: $178 (for two)', 'Snake River strip steak: $206', '', 'It’s a very good prime rib. The flesh flaunts a clean, iron-y tang, while the exterior shows off a beefier, and salt-and-pepper, punch. The jus is just a bit richer than elsewhere; it ties everything together with a hint of MSG-style oomph. But is it any better than the more complex roast at Smith & Wollensky, whose dry-aging imparts a nice Roquefort zing? It is not. Is the service better here? During a final visit, waiters poured free wine like it was tap water, and managers, captains, and staffers practically sent me off with full military honors. ', 'And yet during my prime rib night, I couldn’t get a martini until I was halfway done with my steak. No one stopped to say goodbye as we left, $500 poorer.', 'It might sound a bit strange to be criticizing a la carte dining in this context. The Keller devotee may even argue that the chef is offering a concession to New Yorkers by opening a restaurant that’s cheaper than Per Se.', 'Except that dining at TAK Room hardly feels like a low-cost gift. The beauty of a longer tasting menu like Per Se’s is that it allows for safe experimentation and salutary failure. Nine brilliant courses will outweigh four misses. With a shorter three-course meal, though, the chef has just one shot at that main course. And the pain of that single large dud is multiplied when the price is double what it should be, a scenario that occurs too often at TAK. The $100 main that’s “just okay” functions less like a psychological barrier that diners need to overcome, and more like an income test: Those who can’t afford it don’t belong.', 'If Pe Se, in its heyday, felt like a smart cultural investment, along the lines of box seats at the opera or a limited-run play, TAK Room takes on a different air. It belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. Harry Cipriani is the classic example, while TAK, alongside neighboring Estiatorio Milos, are the more modern ones. The a la carte format in this case lets the 1 percent flex their wealth — amid the company of their privileged brethren — without the burden of a four-hour meal or throngs of destination diners seeking culinary enlightenment. It’s just dinner.', 'To be fair: No one expected TAK to be a cheap hangout. Everything about it is grand, or at least faux-grand: its views of the Hudson (for a select few guests; some seats abut service stations), the sumptuous booths, the live piano player, the crudite amuses (food critics get osetra caviar), the semi-stale candied popcorn mignardises, the sheer expanse of the venue. One could literally fit a sushi bar in its foyer and a cruise ship waterslide on its carpeted staircase and it wouldn’t feel any less roomy. ', 'The environs are about right for lobster Thermidor. The kitchen lightens up the heavy classic with a foam, Gruyere-lace bisque, using it to surround a silky (albeit tiny) tail and two powerfully aromatic claws. It’s essentially a large appetizer — quite nice if you have $110 to spare.', 'Thermidor isn’t the only old-school dish that appears; there’s also sauce Perigourdine, avocado Louis, and celery hearts Victor. TAK Room would be well served to offer descriptions, but the only preparation to receive any type of narrative explanation is the strip steak. The large menu blurb, which is more of a sales pitch, describes the Japanese-Angus hybrid as “the best of both worlds,” and as a meal “for two or for one.” It is among the first items a waiter might recommend. The sixteen-ounce entree costs $206 after tax, and tip. ', 'One wishes a steak so rich could come in a portion that’s a quarter of the size — and price. But the goal here is anchoring, ensuring that high-cost dishes make all the other items seem less preposterous by comparison. Perhaps the $30 eggplant Parm doesn’t seem like such a bad deal in this light. Until you sample it. It’s effectively a bland mash of textureless nightshade in a tomb of mozz and sandy breadcrumbs.', 'Oxtail consomme ($32) is the smarter choice. The meat’s natural gelatins cause one’s lips to stick together, while the broth itself is pure black truffle intensity. Dover sole also does what it should, acting as a soft, flaky conduit for capers and lemon. Still, it is little different from any other sole preparation anywhere else in town.', 'When one thinks of TAK Room, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with the Grill in the old Four Seasons space, that atavistic temple to power. The midcentury-minded spot puts quite a few mains in the $100 club. But many of the entrees fall way below that mark. And the Grill casts a wider net on the past, serving up stellar fare that simply isn’t available elsewhere, from Amish ham steaks to pasta with duck organ juices.', 'TAK Room’s interpretation of yesteryear is narrower and more subtle; it doesn’t feel that different from most contemporary bastions of beef. Steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. Tableside Caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or Parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. It is cold lettuce with dressing. The $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. Black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. The texture is sludge.', 'Better is the Wellington for two ($138), a wonderful riff of the classic, nixing bland tenderloin for a mid-rare short rib that’s almost impossibly heady. The beef needs the pastry crust, (spongy) mushroom duxelles, and truffle sauce to keep its powerful aromas in check. Too bad a smaller, more affordable portion isn’t available for less. ', 'There’s something to be said for a whole fish spot saying, “This is how big our turbot is, we only have one left, and we charge by the pound.” Steaks, however, are the product of in-house butchery. A restaurant that wants to charge less can simply use a knife.', 'Keller is making a choice. He’s making a choice to charge more, just as he’s made a choice to build his more affordable and creative full-service concepts elsewhere, concepts such as Ad Hoc and La Calenda, a Oaxacan spot in Napa Valley. It would be a shame if the takeaway for developers was that we need more restaurants like TAK Room, restaurants where the $100 entree is not just a viable but a desirable goal for more owners and operators to pursue. Sure, it works here. It will likely work elsewhere; there are enough bankers to charge ridiculous prices. Keller knows how to issue a premium on wealthy New Yorkers for fancy food. Now it’s time for him to show he can do something ambitious for the rest of us.', 'Cost: Easily $200 per person or more for 3-4 courses. Remember that most mains are a la carte, as is typical in most steakhouses. That means an $85 filet comes with neither sauces ($6-$12) nor sides ($14).', 'Sample dishes: Shrimp cocktail, oysters Rockefeller, double oxtail consomme, Dover sole, lobster Thermidor, prime rib, short rib Wellington, lemon meringue (with sulfurous meringue), creamsicle bar.', 'Bonus tip: Candied bacon is the side dish of choice. Think of the salty-sweet, lacquered pork belly as a mini Honey Baked Ham for $16. Also: The bar and lounge area accommodates walk-ins, and the full menu is available there.']"

', 'The actor Rowan Atkinson, in his famous “Steak Tartare” skit, contorts his face a thousand different ways while choking down a grayish patty of raw meat. Instead of sending it back, however, he hides the remnants in a small tin of salt, in a woman’s pocketbook, and down the pants of a tableside violinist. Everyone else in the restaurant is oblivious.', 'The bit riffed on multiple themes, from food as an acquired taste to the shame of appearing insufficiently cultured in pompous environs. But there was arguably a plainer lesson tucked in there too: Sometimes expensive cuisine is just bad, and it’s strange when no one else in the dining room seems to notice.', 'Such is the case at Bluebird, the stateside debut of D&D London, one of the U.K.’s most prominent hospitality groups. It’s a sleek brasserie that, despite its manifestly dreadful food — from soggy fish and chips to blubbery duck — can fill up with hundreds of patrons during DJ-fueled brunches. It’s also a venue that sent out a steak tartare so abominable, I struggled to keep it down.', 'Good tartare deploys powerful seasonings to highlight the subtleties of good steak. But the Bluebird version I sampled leaned on spiced ketchup and capers to mask something on the verge of spoiling. The initial flavor was bland, quickly followed by a fetid, ammonia-like tang. It was an aroma that recalled room-temperature hamburger meat from a grocer that lost power. I felt my eyes water up as I chewed. I tried to swallow. I felt my entire GI tract prepare to purge. And then I regained my composure and pulled an Atkinson, which is to say: I spat the nasty bits into a napkin and stuffed it into my briefcase.', 'Let me be clear: Bluebird is New York’s worst new restaurant of 2018. For those who hoped to avoid this sort of thing anyway, keep in mind that next year, D&D will open up an 11,000-square-foot brasserie in the sprawling Hudson Yards complex.', 'To be fair, the Columbia Circle venue, situated in the former A Voce space, never promised culinary fireworks; the London original has always attracted more attention for its chic environs than its culinary accomplishments. ', 'Bluebird in New York, true to form, is pretty. Green booths are arranged in a sinuous S-shaped arrangement. Bottles of gin stand on a plastic sculpture meant to evoke a human head. Purple seats serve as vibrant accents against off-white sofas. And for select tables near the windows, nighttime diners get a brilliant view of Central Park South and Trump Tower. Everyone else experiences obstructed vistas and dining-room reflections.', 'Clockwise, from top left: The dining room at Bluebird, tuna poke bowl, lobster mac & cheese', 'For a blunter sense of the priorities here, consider the following: The restaurant’s website dedicates an entire page to the bios of the brunch entertainment. For example: DJ Sweat apparently faced off against an actor from The Wire in a DJ battle. Now you know.', 'The chef, in turn, is publicized with just two short words: his name, which I’ll respectfully withhold since the menu feels like it was cobbled together by a mercenary consultant or an AI-concocted algorithm instead of a culinary professional. What else could explain “Brooklyn” charcuterie, “Long Island” burrata, poke bowls (of course there are poke bowls), or those infamous 2005-era favorites, lobster mac and cheese and truffle fries?', 'The mac tastes like what would happen if a college student microwaved ziti with supermarket shellfish bisque and waxy pre-shredded cheese. As for the truffles, the black fungi shavings adhere to two or three mealy, undercooked fries like glue. And those poke bowls betray the good name of that Hawaiian mainstay, typically a dice of raw fish bursting with notes from additions such as soy and sesame. Instead, the blocks of tuna are as icy and insipid as the quinoa with which they’re paired; it tastes as if it died in the walk-in cooler.', 'For a marginally better starter, try the foie gras terrine, though that would mean paying $34 for a few bites of liver over a pile of cold green beans and a single artichoke. The prevailing culinary ethos behind that appetizer seems to be: Clean out the fridge. ', 'Bluebird’s sleepy Continental preparations are par for the course at the Time Warner Center. As so many currents of diversity pulsate throughout the city’s dining scene — from modern Chinese to new Indian to creative Vietnamese — this multibillion-dollar complex remains overwhelmingly European and shockingly exorbitant. It stands as a bulwark against the multi-ethnic traditions of nearby Hell’s Kitchen. ', 'There are, of course, outliers. David Chang opened an affordable ramen shop here this year. And Masa serves some pretty good sushi for those who’d like to spend $1,000 on a meal for one. Those aside, the dining options here trend a bit monochromatic.', 'Across from Bluebird, there’s a French bakery, a French cafe, and a French-Italian brasserie. One floor above, there’s a Gallic-American tasting temple where dinner runs $500 to $800 per person. And let’s not forget the bar that sells caviar, burgers, and filet mignon, located right next to an American steakhouse that also sells...caviar, burgers, and filet mignon. ', 'And at the Mandarin Oriental, there’s a duo of cocktail spots where a few rounds of drinks can cost more than a ski jacket, and a place called Asiate, where the kitchen channels the global East by seasoning French food with lemongrass.', 'Diversity is not a driving force when a small group of humans at a multi-billion dollar real estate company curate the dining selections for many. That’s something to think about as the Hudson Yards complex nears completion. And that’s something to contemplate over a $65 strip, Bluebird’s cheapest steak at dinner during a recent visit (now: $58). The cut lacks much of the compelling sweetness, complex char, or supremely beefy essence that dry-aged meats typically have; it’s a squishy cut of meat with an overpowering funk. I paired it with truffle madeira jus ($8) that had all the flavor of powdered onion soup mix. I also ordered fries, which prompted the kitchen to send out a second order of fries as a gift to this solo diner, for no particular reason. My two-course meal that night, with two drinks, cost $159 after tax and tip.', 'In a city teeming with Eurocentric gastropubs, trattorias, bistros, and brasseries, the opening of a new one raises the obvious question: What is it really adding to the our culinary scene? Is it obsessed with moving the needle forward, like a Frenchette? Or is it dedicated to recreating the classics better than anyone else, like a La Mercerie? It’s not hard, after all, to find an average terrine, cheese souffle, or burger in New York, and Bluebird’s are all decidedly below average. ', 'The farmhouse pork pate recalls supermarket ham wrapped in old bread. The twice-baked comte souffle forgoes ethereal silkiness in favor of grittiness. And the burger suffers from an almost equal ratio of cheddar to beef; the bland patty is so undercooked it almost takes on the texture of warm fondue.', 'Roast duck for two ($98) arrives almost wholly unseasoned, with mealy flesh and a thick, under-rendered layer of fat. Better is the lobster thermidor, whose delicately cooked meat packs tons of oceanic flavor — just be sure to eat around the leaden bechamel glaze, and understand you’re paying $38 for an appetizer’s worth of meat.', 'If pressed to order anything at dinner, a mound of crab with trout roe expresses its maritime punch with aplomb. And at peak brunch, one can expect a great English breakfast — rich morcilla, porky sausages, baked tomatoes, sweet beans — as well as a dry pain au chocolat, a stale croissant, and a DJ who spends more time checking his iPhone than working the turntable. He looks bored. ', 'Desserts are respectable enough, from the sticky toffee pudding, which is sufficiently sticky, to the classic Bakewell tart, a blend of fragrant almond paste and orange marmalade.

It claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy Brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, Pop Rocks. The venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own Instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. Another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. This is, to be fair, all what one might expect at Hudson Yards’s Equinox Hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.', 'A lobby host asks if you’re checking in. Maybe you are — if you’ve got $2,000 to spend on two nights. Most folks will instead take an elevator to the 24th floor. There, among the normals, scores of people who look like cutouts from Men’s Health are brunching. Arms bulge through artisanal sweatshirts. Lean torsos jut up like slender tree trunks through drawstring hoodies. A guy in a Patagonia-style vest wears AirPods throughout his entire meal, even while complaining about his eggs.

They’re rare yeast versions of the autumnal treat, normally made in the cake variety at farmers markets. They shimmer from a light glaze, smelling of cinnamon and wet earth. Their texture is bouncy and their flavor is only faintly sweet. Herein lies the surprise of Electric Lemon. Those who look past the GOOP-y branding and weekend DJs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. At least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise Mid-Atlantic fare.

But one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the Vessel. Electric Lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off Midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. ', 'Here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the Bank of America building, the New Yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the Hudson River, and the sun setting over the Jersey City Heights. Here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped Vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.', 'Even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. Try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. Chef Kyle Knall (Maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. As the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. This is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. Knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. A touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. For more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.', 'But for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. Knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. But he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.', 'Much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. Chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. Equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. The flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. It all makes for stellar DIY tacos.', 'If the the beet-yogurt “Beauty Bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the New American style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. For example: Knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. It’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. ', 'Labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by Equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. Still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. Clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-Western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. It’s curious how, at Electric Lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in Hudson Yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots. Also: When a restaurant posts a photo of someone holding a cocktail while their cephalic vein bursts out of their forearm, that effectively signals the type of bodies that belong here, and those that don’t.', 'Whatever the case, Kelly Nam’s spectacular desserts more closely adhere to the ethos of French pastry and American junk food than any diet regimen. ', 'When a server sets down one of the desserts, he points out that you can “hear” the Pop Rocks fizzle and hiss. How bucolic. Nam laces the candy into orbs of pale green lemon verbena sorbet. Next to them, she places frozen spheres of lemon curd. She arranges this all in such a way that channels a faraway solar system, where the orbital bodies are made of sugar and colored in pastels. The sorbet is soft and fragrant; the curd is firm and bracingly sour; and the Pop Rocks, more audible than visible, vibrate across the tongue like a soft electric current. ', '“Moon Rock” exhibits no fewer complexities. The chef showers a soft ball of chocolate in dense, black sesame feuilletine and honeycomb crisps, resulting in an amorphous mass that tastes like a cross between a Butterfinger and a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup.

13,"['Three stars for Biryani Darbar, which offers a stunning lineup of 15 biryanis', 'No dish, except possibly the dosa, is as popular as biryani in Jersey City’s India Square — a two-block stretch of Newark Avenue that descends from Kennedy Boulevard to a tangle of highways on the edge of the Meadowlands, and a three-block hop from the Journal Square PATH station.', 'Six restaurants in India Square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. It’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to India with the Muslim Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of Lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern India, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of Hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.', 'My favorite place to score biryani in India Square is currently Biryani Darbar. Over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear. The menu offers a breathtaking 15 biryanis, but don’t prepare yourself for a visual extravaganza: If set side by side, they wouldn’t look all that different. ', 'I’ve tried 10, and all arrived in a deep, bone-colored bowl heaped with brown, white, and orange rice, surmounted by a boiled egg, cilantro, and a few rings of sweet purple onion. Each vessel was voluminous, enough to satisfy two or three diners.', 'Don’t be fooled by the uniformity of appearance: The biryanis here taste distinct, though subtly so, presenting a swath of styles. The variations originate both in Hyderabad and in nearby Vijayawada, two cities where a tooth-and-nail competition over biryani has been raging.', 'Some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the Hyderabadi style. The flagship of this fleet is Hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. Break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern Indian biryanis.', 'Other versions of the Hyderabadi style deploy goat, mutton, ground mutton, shrimp, Indo-Chinese chile cauliflower, paneer given a smoky flavor by being pre-cooked in the tandoori oven, and boiled eggs. The egg version makes a particularly good brunch dish along with a cold beer on weekend afternoons, when Biryani Darbar’s dining room fills up with shoppers who have come from all over northern Jersey to buy South Asian groceries, sweets, and jewelry.', 'The final three biryanis on a menu created by owners Fahad Kolani and John Sehpur, plus chef Ravi Rajendran, are attributed to the Vijayawada style, and you can tell the minute you look at them because the rice is darker and richer tasting. The one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern India. “But it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” Kolani cautions. “It’s more of a green pickle gravy. It shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern India.”', 'Finally, when the version known as Vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. Though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, Vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the Hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices. (Kolani — a Jersey guy who grew up with Hyderabadi parents — explains that Vijayawada biryani involves mixing pickled ingredients and pungent gravies into the rice at the last minute to make the flavor more intense.)', 'That said, Biryani Darbar has a much more ambitious menu than just its eponymous dish. The bill of fare includes several Indo-Chinese recipes, a full selection of tandoori-baked meats, and northern Mughal vegetable standards like saag paneer and aloo gobi, in addition to a slew of specifically Hyderabadi specialties. Street-food staple chicken majestic ($10.95) is one of those, coarsely shredded and breaded poultry in a lively yogurt sauce colored bright yellow by turmeric. It could become your favorite fried chicken.', 'The menu is also loaded with vegetarian stuff, including gutti vankaya, baby eggplants with a stuffing of coconut, peanuts, tamarind, garlic, ginger, and assorted spices. The filling tends to escape and threatens to drown the eggplants. Is this a defect? Not really, because as with southern Mexican moles, the sauce is the thing — the more the better. Another intriguing vegetarian dish is methi malai muttar ($9.95), which finds peas dunked in a forest-green fenugreek sauce. If you’ve ever wondered what fenugreek tastes like, this is your best chance to find out.', 'Yes, Biryani Darbar is a great all-around Indian restaurant, and a good place to discover some of the non-vegetarian south Indian staples that are harder to find in the NYC area, like the aforementioned chicken majestic and the spectacularly sour gongura mutton curry. But your exploration should begin with one of the restaurant’s superb biryanis from Hyderabad or Vijayawada.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one appetizer, one bread, and one biryani, plus tax but not tip, $50.', 'Sample dishes: Goat paya (goat’s foot soup), chicken majestic, Hyderabadi chicken dum biryani, gutti vankaya (stuffed eggplant).', 'What to Drink: Buttermilk, masala soda, chai (sweet or unsweet), and mango and salt lassis are all offered, but I prefer good old Jersey City tap water.', 'Bonus Tip: Don’t neglect the breads, from a fulsome roster that includes flaky lacha paratha, poultry-stuffed keema naan, and fruit-and-nut-studded Kashmiri naan.']"
14,"['Dennis Ngo’s creative melding of Vietnamese flavors and modern NYC sensibilities, along with dishes rarely served in NYC, is rightly drawing crowds', 'One of New York’s most exciting new dishes originates from the street vendors of Dalat and Ho Chi Minh City. There, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. This bánh tráng nướng, or Vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in Orange County, California, home to one of the country’s biggest Vietnamese populations. But it’s been largely unavailable in New York.', 'That changed with Di An Di, a Greenpoint Vietnamese restaurant from Texas-native Dennis Ngo. When it opened, Ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. ', 'But the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of Vietnam and its American diaspora, debuted something a bit different in December.', 'Ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic Vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. And then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. The crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. The clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. ', 'The chef says the flavor combinations are true to Vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of Northeasterners: a New Haven-style bivalve pie. The menu lists it both as a Vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants Di An Di as a modern Vietnamese-American restaurant. And it’s an excellent one at that.', 'Long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over Chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist Tu Mo had a few smart words about Vietnamese soup. “Don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author Andrea Nguyen. Mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist French rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of Paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.', 'Nearly a century later, Vietnamese spots pepper the Parisian landscape. And even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in New York, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. Few would consider it humble — especially not at Di An Di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than Gallic consommes.', 'It would be just as absurd to call the restaurant humble. Patrons of all stripes line up two hours for bánh xèo — a dosa-like turmeric crepe filled with a warming blend of shrimp, pork, and mung beans; the starchy mixture is bland at first, but a quick application of fish sauce brings the component ingredients to life. ', 'Other diners might reserve weeks in advance to gnaw at wonderfully chewy fried pig tails, sticky with tart tamarind chile sauce. They cleanse their palates with icy vodka highballs, redolent of lemongrass and bergamot, while sitting near neon-green lights and hanging plants.', 'The plant-filled bar room and dining room at Di An Di', 'These are the type of fervent crowds the late Pastis might have commanded in its heyday, or that Momofuku might attract now. Whenever an old developer stuffs his luxe mall or waterfront development full of copycat Euro spots, I think about packed venues like Di An Di, restaurants that will define the future of the city while corporate brasseries sit fallow.', 'Humble, in fact, is not a word that would apply at all to the Big Apple’s rapidly evolving Southeast Asian scene. ', 'New York’s largest flow of Vietnamese immigrants came following the fall of Saigon in 1975; many of them eventually settled in Elmhurst and Flushing, which along with Chinatown still boasts one of the city’s most notable clusterings of phở and banh mi spots. But just as a new class of Korean and Chinese restaurants are popping up around the city, a younger group of Vietnamese venues are making a name for themselves as well, pushing past tradition and the burden of being cheap.', 'Members of this crew include Bunker, backed by a Queens native who dishes up bacon banh mi sandwiches in Bushwick; Hanoi House, which sells uni pancakes in the East Village; and Madame Vo BBQ, whose New York- and Mississippi-born chefs book up the house with $59 seven-course beef tastings. ', 'Di An Di’s operators are second generation; Ngo and Kim Hoang were raised in Houston, home to the country’s third-largest diaspora community, while Tuan Bui hails from Northern Virginia. Accordingly, they reference foods both from their Vietnamese travels and their American upbringings.', 'That means diners can expect chicken over rice, a staple dish in Houston, where it’s normally steamed Hainanese style. Di An Di instead fries the birds, letting them crisp up without any batter. The soft meat and golden skin taste like a mathematically engineered bird: poultry to the power of 100. To amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.', 'Bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of Lone Star Vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare New York appearance here. Strands of rice paper, as wide as tagliatelle and as thin as tissue, act as springboard for a tart jolt of pickled papaya and a salty crumble of beef jerky. It is a perfect cold noodle salad.', 'Lucky guests might also encounter a steamed, grilled, and deep-fried short rib. Ngo says the “entire reasoning” for this special, which packs a powerfully earthy beefiness, was to show off an even more flavor-packed product: mắm nêm. He softens the blow of that famous elixir, forged from whole fermented anchovies, with pineapples, chile, and lime juice. Patrons wrap the beef in the lettuce, then dunk it in the mắm nêm, which has a stunning umami-rich pungency that more or less makes it the durian of steak sauces. ', 'And of course there’s the spring roll, a dish so ingrained in Stateside culture that one can find them, for better or for worse, on a Cheesecake Factory menu. At Di An Di, the flavors seem to sing more brightly than elsewhere. The tamale-sized rice wrapper folds around a fistful of mint and basil, while a pile of shrimp and squid mimic the flavor intensity of a langoustine. ', 'New York’s modern Vietnamese menus are often quite focused in their soup offerings. Hanoi House offers a riff on leaner Northern phở — little more than broth, stretchy rice noodles, fish sauce, and filet mignon — while Madame Vo reps the lusher and more common version from the South, fragrant with cilantro and accompanied by a plate of basil, jalapenos, and sprouts. ', 'Di An Di, by contrast, acts as an outlier in selling both. Cooks cover the Hanoi phở in scallions, adding a touch of perfume to the intensely beefy broth. And they serve the sweeter Southern version with a plate of basil and sprouts for tearing and infusing. Giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.', 'The kitchen also puts out an estimable phở ga (chicken), with a clean poultry tang and a resinous hit of rau ram, as well as a strikingly nuanced bún bò huế, a crimson-hued soup heady with beef, shrimp paste, sweet lemongrass, and bouncier, thicker, firmer noodles.', 'Best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. Patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. This ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes Di An Di a Vietnamese analogue of sorts to Ivan Ramen, one of the few Japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. Diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.', 'Ngo says he plans to tweak the Di An Di formula as it matures, perhaps introducing a late-night program — along the lines of Ssäm Bar in its 2006 days, where Tien Ho served some of the best Vietnamese-American fare the city has ever seen. And he’d also like to revisit dessert, which was nixed after an early effort to keep the tables moving. In other words, the chef is ensuring Di An Di can do what virtually any modern American restaurant serving any type of food needs to do to remain relevant: adapt and evolve. ', 'Cost:  Snacks at $5; rolls, salads, and starters at $8-$16; and phở and other soups at $14-$16. Larger share plates are priced a touch higher; fried chicken and rice runs $17; turmeric crepe with mung bean is $18.', 'Sample dishes: Shrimp and squid spring rolls, bánh tráng trộn\xa0(rice paper salad), crispy pig tails with tamarind chile, bánh tráng nướng\xa0(Vietnamese pizza with shrimp floss or clams), cơm gà\xa0(chicken with rice), bánh xèo\xa0(crispy turmeric crepe), assorted phở, bún bò huế (spicy beef lemongrass soup).', 'Bonus tip: The short-rib special often sells out early! Also keep in mind that waits can often stretch well past an hour for walk-ins; consider using the “notification” function on Resy for last-minute availability due to cancellations.']"
15,"['Stephen Starr’s gilded Gramercy cafe in the newly opened Fotografiska museum showcases Russian dishes rarely represented in New York’s upscale restaurants  ', 'Coulibiac, the Russian fish pie, captured plenty of imaginations more than a century ago. In an 1871 short story, the great Russian author Anton Chekhov wrote that the dish should “make your mouth water, it must lie before you, naked, shameless, a temptation. You wink at it, you cut off a slice, and you let your fingers just play over it.” Legend has it that Auguste Escoffier learned how to prepare coulibiac in Nice while cooking for Russian naval officers early in the 20th century; he subsequently included the recipe in his famous Guide Culinaire, using salmon instead of sturgeon. By 1972, New York Times critic Craig Claiborne, in a meditation on “list-making,” declared it the world’s greatest dish. ', 'Yet despite 100 years’-plus worth of raves, coulibiac is almost completely unavailable in the city’s top restaurants. Veronika, Stephen Starr’s impossible-to-get-into and occasionally excellent Eastern European-leaning establishment, is here to change that. ', 'Located on the second floor of the Fotografiska museum on Park Avenue South, Veronika is a self-proclaimed grand cafe. Triple-tiered chandeliers hang from 20-foot ceilings. Intricate stained glass adorns a gilded lounge. And beautiful people wear jackets at their tables without putting their hands through their sleeves, a sartorial choice that makes it look as if they’re auditioning to eat cake in a chic Austrian perfume advert. It is the type of ornate, pre-crash environment one expects for a grand dish like coulibiac, which the waiter brings out on a white plate with elaborate gold etchings.', 'The coulibiac has three layers: a pink interior of salmon, a thinner ring of rice, and a crisp pastry casing. The kitchen plates the dish as a cross-section, so every component is visible. A pool of Champagne sauce and trout roe spills across the plate.', 'Its look is distinctive: One Instagrammer thought it recalled the Wu-Tang symbol. Another compared the appearance to “alien lungs,” while adding that they wanted to do something to the dish that I would euphemistically describe as “horny.” Yonic or not, it is an exceedingly tasty dish. The salmon is pudding-like in its texture, while the rice tones down the oceanic oils with starchiness and a jolt of lemon. The exterior is appropriately crispy, and the roe adds precise bursts of brine. The clean flavors and declension of textures suggest that in the pantheon of all the world’s great savory pies — from Bolivian saltenas to Moroccan pastillas to French pithiviers — the coulibiac, particularly at Veronika, is no less deserving of a seat at the table.', 'Veronika is a departure for Starr. Over the past six years, the prolific restaurateur has focused his New York offerings on modern American, British, or Western European fare (there was also El Vez, his Mexican endeavor from early 2014). His latest establishment, however, bills itself as a grand European cafe that’s “romantically reminiscent of Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century,” that gilded era before two World Wars and an Iron Curtain would devastate and divide the continent.', 'A culinary yearning for the past tends to play well in these Trumpian times; one thinks of the Grill or Anton’s. And Starr also happens to be filling a hole in the city’s modern dining scene. Veronika is Manhattan’s only high-end Eastern European-leaning restaurant. Kachka in Portland is a national sensation, but tony Manhattan restaurants — or even everyday brasseries — don’t really draw from the cuisines of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, or the Balkans for their upscale fare. That’s a shame given the deliciousness of those traditions, not to mention their historic use of fermentation, pickling, foraging, and other techniques and ingredients trending in the modern culinary world.', 'Chef Robert Aikens, who helped open Starr’s Pastis, brings some of these sensibilities to Veronika. The improbably named classic known as “herring under a fur coat” is often a hefty, nourishing terrine molded in a casserole dish. Here, it looks and tastes like a zingy dish one might encounter at a hip neo-bistro. The chef hides slivers of ultra-oily fish underneath thin slices of puckery beets, while a grating of eggs gives everything the smooth mouthfeel of edible mink. Or with pork-laced borscht, Aikens imparts the classic soup with just a touch more acid than elsewhere, reining in the sweetness of the beets with cider vinegar — while also adding the requisite sour cream, which bleeds into the red broth and gives it a faintly pink hue.', 'Aikens also draws his inspirations from Austria and France, and in one case brings in a rare Gallic delight from the United Kingdom: soufflé suissesse. The great Roux brothers created the dish in 1965 for London’s Le Gavroche. The suissesse is a paradox: an airy dome of eggs drenched in mornay — that emulsion of bechamel and gruyere that’s the heaviest known drinkable liquid in the universe. The wicked-hot soufflé vanishes on the palate, while the cheese sauce never seems to disappear, enrobing the tongue with its luscious fats and alpine funk.', 'Like other dishes at Veronika, the suissesse adopts a khaki palette. This is neutral-hued food that stands in contrast to the extravagant room. Even lobster Americaine, with its sweet, crimson meat, takes on the faded tones of an old VHS movie. It’s as it should be for such a throwback dish, whose chief pleasure is in mopping up the rusty shellfish reduction with rice. ', 'And then there is the study in white and off-white: three bone-colored pierogies filled with creamy potatoes and paired with sour cream. An inconsequential dollop of caviar vanishes into the background. Are the $17 dumplings any more refined than the $7 ones at Veselka, the everyday East Village hangout? Not really, but sometimes it’s nice to have rustically excellent fare in a fancy establishment. Not everything needs to be poured through a sieve 800 times to qualify as high-end.', 'Those pierogies, however, prompt a larger question for Veronika, which is whether it’s trying too hard to make a cafe, a purportedly democratic institution, into an exclusive one. For the most part, it’s not necessarily a question of price, but rather access. Dining here requires month-ahead planning. There are no tables set aside for walk-ins, nor is there bar dining. It’s a style of unapproachability that’s only slightly more understandable at Starr’s fancier temple of Gallic gastronomy, Le Coucou. ', 'Those who simply drop by for a drink at Veronika, like my colleague did recently, will find that the entire space is reserved for folks with a booking, meaning the joy of people-watching and taking in the gorgeous room is verboten (folks without bookings are sent to the downstairs chapel bar). It’s hard not to wonder: With ceilings high enough to accommodate a few Gulfstream private jet fuselages, could Starr not have found room for a bar with more than six seats, so a few more impromptu patrons could enjoy a drink here — or a bite?', 'This approach to dining feels tilted toward an older moneyed class who want to know precisely where they’ll be eating their roast duck a month from today, and who want to guarantee that even an a la carte meal will be a theatrical, 90-minute experience. If restaurants like Momofuku, Estela, or Wildair represent the prevailing style of dressed-down, downtown, small-plates places, Veronika recalls one of those uptown prix fixe white-tablecloth spots from 2003 where every meal was three to four courses, and where the reservationist was your chief barrier to entry.', 'Hence the boring black cod, preternaturally crispy but slathered in a monochromatic butter sauce, and the perfunctory snails in garlic butter. There’s also the requisite tuna tartare, filet mignon, and Dover sole. Given the ubiquity of those dishes around town, it’s hard not to wish Aikens instead highlighted more regional fare with less representation. Then again, given how rarely one encounters the opposite — you don’t see Balthazar slinging pelmeni — the more generous assessment is that Veronika is the outlier, expanding the concept of what a pan-European menu can look like. ', 'For those who can motivate themselves to care about eating these types of things 30 days out, Veronika is uniformly excellent. For those who can’t, there’s a more casual cafe downstairs that sells turkey on pretzel rolls. Perhaps the Starr team will at least start offering some of Veronika’s cakes in that space, particularly the medovik, a riff on the Russian delicacy that layers golden-brown cake with honey chantilly icing — instead of the traditional sour cream (verdict: It tastes about the same). Muscovites often pair it with tea in the late afternoon, and I have no doubt that when Veronika opens up for lunch, taking an impromptu trip here for a slice of the soft, heady tort will be easier.', 'Price: At least $100 per person for a three-course meal with wine, tax, and tip. Starters run $18 to $26; mains are $27 to $54; desserts are $14 to $16. Caviar service starts at $115.', 'Sample dishes: Potato pierogi, soufflé suissesse, herring under a fur coat, borscht, lobster a l’Americaine, wiener schnitzel, lamb goulash, medovik', 'Bonus tip: Patrons at Veronika can access the museum afterward for $14 (half price). The photography museum doesn’t close until 11 p.m. most nights and is until midnight on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays', '', '', 'Sign up for our newsletter.']"
16,"['London-based group Rhubarb’s New York City debut goes wrong at every turn with Frankenstein fusion', 'Something unusual happened during a recent visit to Wild Ink, a restaurant whose lounge offers bucolic vistas of a Louis Vuitton store across the hallway. My server suggested a few dishes on the Asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” It was a curious statement. I hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness. The waiter simply felt the need to warn me, preemptively, that a signature preparation was garbage.', 'So I did what any other normal diner would’ve done. I ordered them.', 'Three little empanadas, filled with marinated beef, arrived minutes later. I winced as I took a bite. Chefs infuse the meat with inhumane levels of sugar and salt; if the kitchen had any sense of balance, the meat might be accompanied by kimchi or lettuce wraps to keep the seasonings in check. Instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. It turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. ', 'In place of classic bulgogi, diners are treated to a veritable Frankenstein of a dish, an unholy triad recalling microwaveable Hot Pockets, airline Korean food, and hospital-quality Welsh rarebit. The bartender asked me how I liked them.', 'Consider this review to be more honest than whatever my reply actually was.', 'Wild Ink is a wild trip of a restaurant. The 175-seat space is located on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards, a shiny new Manhattan neighborhood that recalls the sterile dystopian metropolis of Demolition Man. The sound system blasts the type of Mac Miller remixes one might expect to hear at a Times Square H&M. Cooks and waiters sauce dim sum themselves, as if they were omakase sushi chefs priming each morsel for perfection. The unfortunate result is that the dumplings turn to mush.', 'Sometimes hosts don’t greet you because they’re staring down at their phones. In fact, managers can be so unaware of things that one night, a touchscreen menu outside inadvertently displayed an unlocked version of the Resy table-booking service, displaying the names of the guests and their phone numbers to anyone who clicked through. At least I got to search my pseudonyms!', 'If there were anything to get truly excited about, it was that Wild Ink marked, for a brief time, the New York return of Tien Ho. When it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than Ho, whom Wild Ink’s London-based parent company, Rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. The chef helped bring David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing Korean, French, American, and Japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. He followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at Ma Peche and Montmartre. And then he suddenly left the world of day-to-day cooking, taking corporate gigs at Whole Foods and Morgans Hotel Group.', 'The scene at Wild Ink, plus lamb momo and mapo tofu dumplings', 'At Hudson Yards, his official title was culinary director for Rhubarb U.S., the local outfit of the British-based group famous for its insipid restaurants and catering venues. Just as his old boss, Chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, Ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. He had been working for “several months” with the Wild Ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, Rhubarb and Ho announced they were parting ways. It just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” Ho said. The fact that Wild Ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.', 'Take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef Peter Jin. The point of this Sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. Jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. The wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.', 'The mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. The same can be said about General Tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to Heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the Cantonese-American staple.', 'There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fusing diverse cuisines, experimenting with classics, or upscaling rustic preparations; Ho was once a master of this. These techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. ', 'But the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. It’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, Instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or Cheesecake Factory.', 'Like, did Jin really have to fry bulgogi and mapo into “this-won’t-stain-your-shirt” finger food? Does a shumai dumpling really need so much bacon that you can’t taste the overcooked shrimp? Does cold Chinese celery need to be turned into yet another bland “add-seared-tuna” salad? Is it not completely mental that this is the only restaurant serving Chinese food in a brand-new neighborhood?', 'Perhaps most frightening of all is that Wild Ink appears as crowded — if not more so — than Chang’s much better Kawi on any given night, with revelers knocking back bland matcha vodka mules and munching on celeriac root skewers as undercooked as raw potatoes.', 'If someone does drag you here, the beef tartare is simple and excellent, with cool chunks of beef lit ablaze with hot mustard. Crab rangoon boasts a clear shellfish aroma and a remarkably light fry. Yuzu risotto is a smart bet, too. It’s a simultaneous ode to Japan and Italy, with the citrus cranked up to levels so insane that one could sell this dish as a scented candle. And yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. It’s a loud, beautiful creation.', 'And roast duck is passable enough, if you can make do with the dry confit leg and sinewy breast with under-rendered fat. That’s not quite a compliment, but the preparation is more forgivable than the scallops with dal. One could imagine a genius pairing here, with the kitchen juxtaposing the creamy, earthy lentils against sweet, caramelized scallops. Alas, Wild Ink plates such gritty legumes that they inadvertently act as an ode to the sandiness of poorly cleaned shellfish. ', 'Rice pudding, too, does little for the palate.The grains, hidden under slices of mango, have been cooked into mush and chilled into a flavorless chokehold. Pineapple upside-down cake, in turn, is simply a fine, forgettable riff on the midcentury classic, with ginger ice cream tempering the fruit’s sugars.', 'Wild Ink poses more questions than it answers: Did Ho simply not monitor Jin closely enough? Had he lost touch with the city’s changing culinary scene following his absence? Did the Rhubarb folks issue a cruel clubstaurant food mandate, arguing they’ll sell better with the mall crowd? Will things be this mediocre when the next Rhubarb spot opens at the Hudson Yard observatory? Whatever the answers, let me end by paraphrasing the words of my honest bartender: I can’t recommend that you eat here.', 'Cost: Smaller dishes at $8-$22; mains at $25 (yuzu risotto) to $38 (bavette steak). Short rib at $80; Peking duck at $85.', 'Sample dishes: Crispy chickpea fritters, bulgogi beef puffs, lobster har gow, snow crab rangoon, mapo dumpling, spit-roasted celeriac, yuzu risotto, coconut rice pudding with mango.', 'Bonus tip: For those who find the Vessel aesthetically pleasing, Wild Ink’s dining room tables offer some of the most direct views.\xa0']"
17,"['Chef Erik Ramirez’s Village hot spot beautifully delivers on Nikkei fare, a style rarely seen in New York', 'Ambitious modern sushi is typically a very specific thing in New York. That is: a traditional and expensive omakase parlor hawking exquisitely butchered fish, much of it endangered bluefin, over vinegared rice. Sushi at Llama San in Greenwich Village, however, is a very different thing. The stunner of a Peruvian spot offers just a single type of nigiri, forged from duck, cilantro, and fried banana.', 'There is no chef standing solemnly behind a counter, doling out pristine morsels piece by piece. Chef Erik Ramirez simply sends his creations into the blonde-wood dining room, where Fiona Apple’s “Criminal” pipes through the sound system. A staffer walks to and fro waving burning palo santo sticks, blessing the space with pungent smoke. ', 'Four nasturtium leaves, so green they’re practically glowing, seem to hover above the plate. Under each one lies the sushi: a mound of coriander rice below a sheath of paper-thin duck breast. The perfume of coriander hits the palate first, then the savoriness of the rice, then the the earthy essence of aged waterfowl. And just when the gaminess starts to creep up, the banana, tucked between the grains and the bird like a pat of wasabi, issues a whisper of sweetness. ', 'This is sushi that’s as worthy of critical contemplation as any toro hand roll. And while Llama San offers an omakase that runs $500 for two after drinks, the duck nigiri is only available a la carte, for $24.', 'From top left: nasturtium sitting over aged duck nigiri; patrons gathering in a packed bar room; head bartender Natasha Bermudez placing an ice cube in a palo santo-filled glass', 'Peruvian restaurants constitute a vital part of New York-area restaurant landscape, furnishing everything from grilled skewers to tart ceviches to rotisserie chickens. ', 'What Ramirez is doing at Llama San, however, constitutes a branch of Andean cuisine with less obvious (if growing) stateside representation. That style of cooking is called Nikkei, a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the South American country’s culinary ethos. Scores of Japanese people emigrated to Peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to U.S. internment camps during World War II.', 'Generations later, myriad sushi and udon spots thrive from Cusco to Arequipa. ', 'Anyone who’s been to a Nobu has encountered some form of Nikkei. Its chef brought worldwide fame to tiradito (sashimi) with rocoto chile paste and filet mignon with zippy anticucho sauce. But while Nobu has turned into a blandly internationalist chain that bills its food as Japanese, Llama San proudly calls itself Nikkei, exhibiting a deeper level of virtuosity in the style.', 'Ramirez slicks translucent rice noodles in a sesame soy vinaigrette. They slurp up easily until a sucker punch of pepper pricks the tongue. He douses crimson cubes of tuna in ponzu; they seem to pulsate with the nuclear level of soy and yuzu. He pairs fried Iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. And he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an Andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. The mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.', 'His tofu acts as an essay in the colors yellow and white. A rectangular block of soy curd covers a mash of shrimp mousse, while a golden pool of garlicky seafood sauce imparts warmth. Rice crackers hide a pile of tender lobster, displaying a charcoal-grilled singe, and smoky chunks of corazon — no gamier than skirt steak. It’s a surf and turf like no other; the shellfish jus and beefy heart drippings, fortified with oregano and vinegar, enrich a serving of sushi rice underneath.', 'Hand rolls are not uncommon in Nikkei cuisine, but the way Ramirez prepares them is. He takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. Tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. The combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.', 'Ramirez has emerged as the city’s most studied and satisfying purveyor of modern Peruvian in all its diverse forms. He serves up beef corazon skewers at Williamsburg’s Llama Inn; shrimp noodles and rotisserie birds at Llamita in the West Village; and now, at Llama San, a compact menu of creative and visually striking small plates. ', 'Most people in the dining room will justifiably only order off of the a la carte menu. But Llama San also offers a $150 omakase, a rare South American tasting in New York. The 10-course meal largely pulls from the regular menu and is best for solo diners who want to experience the brilliance of Llama San in a single sitting.', 'The meal kicks off with a bite of kaluga caviar between two crisps. The kitchen could have easily let the roe stand alone; instead, it’s paired with a swatch of miso manjar blanco — a South American dulce du leche of sorts. Purists might recoil at this combination, but the mix of oceanic brine and aromatic sugars is simply a perfumed riff on a sea salt-laced caramel.', 'Ramirez also sneaks in an off-menu oyakadon, a Japanese chicken-over-rice bowl, which he crosses with estofado de pollo, a Peruvian poultry stew. For this, he uses gizzards. Japanese restaurants love to highlight the snappy texture of the digestive organ, but Llama San takes a more rustic tact, braising them until they’re barely firmer than a chicken nugget. The little knobs, which flaunt just an inkling of poultry funk, sit sandwiched between an egg omelet and a layer of rice. The flavor profile recalls sweet tamago sushi crossed with rich sausage.', 'Does one need a hefty plate of wagyu short rib after six previous courses? Probably not, and perhaps Ramirez should consider showing off his stronger dishes, like the surf and turf or Iberico, instead of ending yet another Manhattan tasting menu with this ubiquitous luxury. That said, Llama San sends out an impressively beefy cut, fortified with what might be the world’s greatest potato salad, which is laced with bites of squishy egg and tiny, sweet shrimp.', 'Ramirez operates with just as much skill at dessert, showering an undulating blob of custard with Fanta-colored satsuma ice and halved gooseberries. The combination speaks to its component flavors: the egginess of the cream, the cool citrus punch of the granita, and the rampant acidity of the pulpy fruit. I ask the waiter if it’s based on a Peruvian dessert. She responds that it’s based on a creamsicle. Right on.', 'Older, fancier tasting spots cap off dinner with a flurry of petits fours. Llama San instead offers a single bite and a shot of booze: a matcha truffle infused with muña (Andean mint) and a few sips of pisco. The candy’s dusty exterior boasts a tannic astringency, but that bitterness quickly yields to a soft, buttery, grassy interior. The accompanying liquor parries the sugary blow. ', 'A restaurant doesn’t need to send out a mignardise to qualify as “fancy” or “good,” but inasmuch as the wagyu crowd considers this sort of thing as a signifier of luxury, Ramirez and company are arguing that they can tango with the best of them. Indeed, they can.', 'Cost: Most dishes in the $20s and $30s. Expect to spend about $100 per person or more for about three to four courses for each diner. The tasting runs $150 and must be booked in advance.', 'Sample dishes: Scallop ceviche with cherimoya, tuna with ponzu, duck nigiri with fried banana, tofu with shrimp mousse and chile sauce, beef hearts and lobster over sushi rice, chicken thigh maki, Iberico pork tonkatsu, creamsicle dessert.', 'Bonus tip: Bar seating during prime time is often reserved via Resy; check the app for cancellations. Just the same, for a more sushi-heavy Nikkei experience in New York, with omakase services as well, consider Midtown’s Sen Sakana.']"
18,"['Farida serves a collection of Central Asia’s top dishes, from a succulent chicken kebab to flaky pumpkin pastry', 'Farida claims to be “the first and only Central Asian cuisine in the heart of Manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. As long as two decades ago, Kosher Uzbek restaurants such as the legendary Taam Tov flourished in the Diamond District, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. I’m not kidding! Though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. ', 'Much more recently, quick-service Central Asian places have popped up, such as Kebab Empire in Hell’s Kitchen, which calls itself Uyghur cuisine. But what Farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service Central Asian restaurants are in places like Sheepshead Bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping Casios like Palmyra, Kaifuem, and the original Nargis, which cater to Central Asian and Russian customers and specialize in banquets.', 'Farida is named after owner Farida Gabbassova-Ricciardelli, who runs the restaurant along with her husband, chef Umitjon Kamolov, nicknamed “John.” The place lies a few steps south of the Port Authority on Ninth Avenue, far from the mass of Central Asian restaurants in Brooklyn. But the couple opted for the Midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” Gabbassova-Ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.', 'It resembles neither a nightclub nor a quick-service cafe, but looks like many of the other small ma-and-pa restaurants that populate Ninth Avenue’s restaurant row. The dining room is deep and narrow, with an alcove in front, and a counter in back that looks into the kitchen. Murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. The servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.', 'A Central Asian menu similar to others in town is offered, though not as complete as those of the Brooklyn plov palaces. Both Kamolov and his co-chef, Firdavs Saidov, hail from Samarkand — one of three most important Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan — while the owner is from Kazakhstan, but they try to have dishes from all over Central Asia.', 'Each part of Uzbekistan has its distinctive version of plov, the rice pilaf with Arabian roots. Elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. Not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. Carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on Farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of Samarkand.', 'The fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. Make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: The same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.', 'That brings us to the kebabs. Here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for Central Asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout Russia in the 19th century. Like Argentines and Texans, Central Asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. Lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at Farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. Get fries or naan bread on the side.', 'The chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.', 'But Farida is hardly a health-food restaurant. Take the Tashkent salad ($15), named after another of Uzbekistan’s glittering Silk Road cities and its capital. This decidedly ungreen salad features shredded daikon radish and shredded beef, with crisp fried onion on top, bound together in the Russian style with thick mayo. ', 'Want something healthy? Check out the mellifluous-sounding achichuk, which is mainly tomatoes goosed with fresh dill and onions. The soups are also magnificent at Farida, including a meal-sized lagman with plenty of handmade noodles something like udon. ', 'There are further high points. Shot with chickpeas, the oxtail stew ($21) is a version of the Samarkand wedding dish, but you don’t have to be betrothed to enjoy it.', 'Farida presents a “greatest hits” of Central Asian cuisine, with an emphasis on Uzbekistan. The food is wholesome and freshly prepared by a chef and crew that display a real zeal for the cuisine. And aside from Texas barbecues, it’s your best chance to get charcoal-grilled meats that taste powerfully of smoke in “the heart of Manhattan,” just as the website says.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two kebabs, a shared bowl of lagman, an order of pumpkin manti, and a pot of tea, plus tax but not tip, $55.', 'Sample dishes: Lamb rib shashlyk, crispy chuchvara dumplings, pumpkin samsa, Tashkent salad.', 'What to drink: The traditional drink in Central Asia is a pot of tea, available here in green and black varieties, but Russian beer and Tarkhun, an amazing tarragon soda, are also available.', 'Bonus tip: If you feel overwhelmed by the quantity of meat at Farida, consider ordering the massive pickle plate, which features tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and Persian cukes in a light pickle. It provides enough vegetable matter for several diners.', '', '']"
19,"['The pan-regional Indian restaurant sends out homey dishes with punch', 'The “oohs” and “ahhs” follow dum biryani ($19) as it bobs across the room. The casserole is topped by a sheet of naan dough that imprisoned the volatile flavors as the dish baked. This sealing-in is what the “dum” refers to, in a recipe attributed by the menu to the far northern city of Lucknow, India, though biryani is more often associated with the southern city of Hyderabad.', 'Arriving at our table, the waiter takes a big spoon and saws the nicely browned crust with a circular motion. Then he flips the flap of crust over so the steam spirals out, redolent of saffron and sweet spices. Inside, rice shimmers with chunks of bone-in goat and shredded herbs. The first bite proves exquisite, especially when further moistened with the tart pomegranate raita provided.', '“My purpose at Adda,” executive chef Chintan Pandya told me one evening, “is to reproduce the true taste of Indian home cooking.” He continued, “I’m from Gujarat and Mumbai and owner Roni Mazumdar is from Kolkata in West Bengal, so we come from different places, but certain things are shared. I’m trying to cook the way our mothers did.”', 'It’s an effort rarely found in New York City Indian restaurants: Not only is Adda making a conscientious effort to dig into the regionalities of Indian cuisine, it’s doing so with accessibly priced, homestyle fare, where all dishes fall under $20. ', 'Many chefs at Indian restaurants in neighborhoods across NYC adapt recipes for what they think are American customer preferences, and the more ambitious pan-regional places skew more expensive, including Pandya’s Greenwich Village restaurant Rahi. But Adda does neither. And the quest to replicate home cooking at Adda is, perhaps, why the dishes are a degree hotter and richer, with some ingredient choices and combinations not commonly found in other New York Indian restaurants. ', 'Take “seasonal saag paneer” ($15). Many restaurants stick to mustard greens and spinach or substitute spinach entirely, which makes for a mellower dish. But Adda’s version is composed of whatever greens happen to be in the market in the moment. The other evening, it included red amaranth leaves, produce that’s common in traditional Indian cooking and now stylish in the States as an antioxidant. ', 'What’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many NYC Indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. The problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. Adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.', 'The same incredible paneer constitutes a focus of the menu. Have it in chile paneer tikka ($7). Here, a spicy red sauce has been painted on the grilled squares; they tumble onto the plate like paving stones. Less exciting is paneer khurchan, which tosses the fresh cheese with peppers in a tomato sauce that obscures the cheese’s delicate flavor. ', 'While a few Indian restaurants focused on regional cuisines have incorporated pork (prevalent in Goa and Karnataka) and beef (a Keralan favorite) into their menus, Adda sticks with the standards of chicken, lamb, and goat, which pertain in most restaurants here and in India. Lamb is showcased in one special, a hulking ground-meat seekh kebab ($13) that’s an especially good deal if volume of meat is your objective.', 'But the best dish among a dozen meat and poultry choices is a goat curry called junglee maas ($18), or “wild meat,” a reference to people cooking what they hunt. Goat curries, of course, are ubiquitous at Punjabi steam-table restaurants throughout the city, often in stunning renditions. Adda, though, one-ups even the best of them with the junglee maas. The bones are left in, as they should be, and the gravy is at once fiery and pungent. If you love goat, this curry will drive you crazy and leave your tongue burning. Other standards of top steam-table restaurants are produced here in even better renditions too, including a butter chicken so rich it boasts streaks of actual butter on the surface.', 'Offal cravers will find a pao (round roll of Portuguese origin) topped with chicken livers, and a bheja fry newly added to the menu — gingery goat brains. And though meat shines here, vegetarians will find plenty to love on Adda’s bill of fare, including globular lotus-root kofta akin to croquettes that rest in a tomato sauce laced with fenugreek, and a tandoori-cooked cauliflower topped with a layer of Amul, a processed cheese based on cheddar that’s in the same family as Velveeta. My mom would have loved it. ', 'Adda lies on the border of Long Island City and Sunnyside in an industrial neighborhood, with the 7 train clattering overhead and LaGuardia Community College directly across the street. The inside features a counter and overhang at the rear made of corrugated tin, and newspapers are plastered all over one wall, modeled after hangouts in India. While waiting for your food, study the papers for a thumbnail history of modern India.', 'Pandya and owner Roni Mazumdar also preside over Rahi, an upmarket restaurant in the West Village that plays fast and loose with Indian regional cooking, sometimes inflecting it with Japanese and Middle Eastern twists. ', 'But the food at newcomer Adda is simpler, cheaper, and less beholden to current trends demanding that the camera eats first — which is a good thing, and which evokes the kind of Indian food I first fell in love with at steam tables across NYC. And in pursuing the actual home cooking of regions across India, Adda gives us a new perspective on an already familiar cuisine.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two apps, two main dishes, a bread, and two Indian sodas, plus tax but not tip, $60.', 'Sample dishes: Kale pakoda, Malvani prawn curry, seasonal saag paneer, Lucknow dum biryani, garlic naan.', 'What to Drink: You might want to try an imported Indian soda like Thums Up or Limca. Currently, Adda is BYOB, and there’s a 7-Eleven with an abysmal beer selection two doors down to the east.', 'Bonus Tip: One dessert is usually available, a kheer (rice pudding) snowed with crushed pistachios and cashews attributed to the owner’s father.

20,"['Red Paper Clip is busy and filled with promise, but two Blue Hill alum chefs aren’t fulfilling them yet', 'Not too long into dinner at Red Paper Clip, an Asian-leaning tasting-menu spot in the West Village, a server brings over an ash-colored plate decorated with white swirls of yogurt and scattered herbs. “Carrot katsu,” he says. This is unusual, not just because this breadcrumb-enriched cutlet is typically made with pork or chicken, but rather because this style of Japanese cooking isn’t frequently seen at a bastion of expensive eating — unless it involves a fat slab of luxurious wagyu. ', 'The katsu packs a deeper, denser crunch than a more cloud-like piece of tempura. The exterior, however, quickly yields to a softer orange interior, at once vaguely sweet and savory. Those swirls of yogurt, in turn, add a soothing tang, while shiso oil conveys a minty, licorice-tinged perfume. ', 'On a good night, it easily ranks as one of the better katsu dishes in a town, and it shows that a more rustic Japanese dish like this one is just as deserving of a place on a tasting menu as a slice of blow-torched tuna neck. On a bad night, however, the carrots are undercooked and cloying. The aroma of the shiso is flat. And the conversation ends there, a disappointing conclusion to an exciting idea. ', '“These are black truffles from Oregon,” a waiter announces a few minutes later, shaving them over something dubbed xiaolongbao agnolotti. It’s a cross between the Italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the Shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. You pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. It never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. ', 'And at $95 for the tasting, the price isn’t too shabby either.', 'The two-month-old Red Paper Clip, an uneven solo debut from Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. One is about a duo of Blue Hill at Stone Barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. As sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. ', 'Contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while Luthun in the West Village and Reverence in Harlem represent newer entrants to the field. And while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to Red Paper Clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. The people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.', 'The presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of China. Chen, a native New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, and Gyamtso, who was raised in Tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Himalayan ingredients with those from France, Italy, Japan, and elsewhere. That’s no small matter. While a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, Chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as Korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.', 'A waiter shaves black truffles over XLB agnolotti.', 'Tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.', 'But the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. A restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. And inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that Chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their Western (or Japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see Chen and Gyamtso prove folks wrong.', 'There are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. Corey Lee’s Benu in San Francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while Kato in Los Angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other Taiwanese delicacies. But in New York, an expression of Chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of XO sauce here, a dab of indiscernible Sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.', 'It’s for this reason that one might scoff at Red Paper Clip’s Sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. A sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. Then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. Slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. And finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. Visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an Estela or a Wildair, but its DNA feels Sichuan through and through.', 'Then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. It’s just another carpaccio.', 'Here’s simplicity at its best: Chen and Gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. This infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. Things are quite lovely. Until they’re not. During another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.', 'Therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of September. Underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that Chen and Gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. Red Paper Clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. ', 'Or consider the lobster three ways. There’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. The butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. And the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. Mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.', 'That criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. They have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. Occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. An act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. But it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. ', 'The late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. The kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. These “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. Whimsical moments like these suggest that Red Paper Clip will eventually find its groove. For now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.', 'Cost: The dining room is tasting-only at $95 (gratuity is extra). The bar menu includes a tight collection of small plates at $18-$37.', 'Sample dishes: Nori fettuccine with maitake, carrot katsu, Sichuan beef carpaccio, agnolotti xiaolongbao, lobster three ways, smoked short rib with fermented greens and yeasted potato.', 'Bonus tip: There is currently no list of wines by the bottle; the restaurant, rather, employs a “human wine list,” with whom you discuss your preferences. Patrons, of course, are handicapped by not knowing the range of prices. (“This isn’t intentional; we haven’t gotten around to putting together the list,” a bartender says.) In the meantime, go by the glass.']"
21,"['The second New York iteration of David Chang’s flagship is the best addition to the Time Warner Center in over a decade', 'The most exciting meal of Julia Child’s life, by her own account, was a 1948 lunch of Dover sole meuniere. Served at a small auberge in Normandy, the fish came in a “sputtering” butter sauce, while the delicate flesh exhibited a “light but distinct taste of the ocean,” she wrote. Nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of European and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era. Wait captains normally debone the fish tableside, pair it with a restrained sauce, and sometimes toss in a few capers.', 'The restaurants selling these skinless fillets — inevitably starchy institutions with Continental overtones — will charge anywhere from $62 to $100. It is a very pretty dish. Usually.', 'One wonders what Child would’ve thought of the version at David Chang’s slyly thrilling Momofuku Noodle Bar in Midtown. Alongside the porky ramen, chickpea soft serve, and frozen banana daiquiris, there is a Dover sole that has evolved — or devolved — a touch more than others. It is neither delicate nor pretty. ', 'No tableside service here. Patrons watch as cooks, under the aegis of chef Tony Kim, unceremoniously griddle the sole, pressing a weight against it for a hard sear. Waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. The flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. It doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. It is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. ', 'The cost is just $43 here at the Time Warner Center, home to the city’s densest collection of offensively priced restaurants. It’s as if Chang is saying: “We can cook with the same obvious luxuries as our neighbors, do more with them, and charge less.” Not bad for a chain restaurant on the third floor of a shopping mall. ', 'Chang, who rose to celebrity status as an expletive-spewing chef bent on dressing down fine dining and subverting culinary traditions, is not an empire builder in the typical sense. He doesn’t Xerox fine dining temples like the late Joel Robuchon or overpriced steakhouses a la Wolfgang Puck. Almost all of his sit-down concepts are genuinely unique, from Seiobo, a Caribbean-Australian tasting counter in Sydney, to Nishi, an Asian-Italian pasta place in New York, to Majordomo, an haute-rustic hotspot in Los Angeles. ', 'But Noodle Bar — along with his Fuku fast-food outlets — appears slated for interplanetary replication. Chang runs three of them, in the East Village, Time Warner, and Toronto, or arguably four, as the Las Vegas Momofuku borrows heavily from the chain’s repertoire of ramen, pork buns, and fried chicken. ', 'Given how much culinary risk Chang takes elsewhere — not to mention that fact that his venture capital backers will likely want a return on their investment — it would be understandable if Noodle Bar turned out to be the chef’s carbon-copy money maker. ', 'And yet that appears not to be the case, at least not here. ', 'Caviar chicken buns at Noodle Bar', 'This Midtown Momofuku has forged an identity of its own, embracing the sterile mall as much as its international eclecticism and somehow maintaining its soul throughout. Across from a Bose Store, a J.Crew, and a bland brasserie — a commercial cul-de-sac that’s barren after 8 p.m. — Noodle Bar teems with life. The long bar, cramped booths, and open kitchen evoke a packed 24-hour diner. Patrons dunk squishy Hot Pocket-shaped buns into pools of jus; it is a French dip for the future, with the muscular beef concentrate magnifying the oomph of the soft brisket stuffing.', 'An electric sign, equipped with flapping panels like the Grand Central train departures board, advertises nightly specials. If the buttery Gulf shrimp over rice appear, order them; the Viet-Cajun dish, a hat tip to the Houston upbringing of sous chef Gary Ly, bursts with Old Bay, cayenne, shallots, and cilantro. ', 'Beef katsu, in turn, pays homage to nearby Japanese izakayas. The kitchen coats a rib in panko and deep-fries it, imparting the tender, musky meat with a distinct crunch. Just when things get too rich, an agrodolce steak sauce slices through all the bovine fats with the aplomb of A-1. And next door at lunchtime, cooks shave gochujang-laced pork into soft rounds of bang bread, a hat tip to Midtown’s streetside pita vendors.', 'These creations, while not Chang’s per se, are still classically Changian, which is to say globally curious yet laced with strong American and Asian leanings. ', 'A few of the specials, however, seem designed as affordable odes to the luxe mall itself, a bastion of oligarch-ian indulgences. Thomas Keller’s Per Se charges $125 for its black truffle tagliatelle. Noodle Bar, by contrast, is planning to offer a spectacularly earthy tartufo nero ramen, likely for about $49.', 'Oodles of Time Warner spots levy $95-plus for caviar. Noodle Bar commands a more reasonable $28 for fried chicken buns, where the crispy meat gets a saline kick from a generous shower of smoked trout roe — a break from Noodle Bar’s $500 version of this dish that has heaps of black caviar. No, it’s not the same thing, but since many can only afford one of the above, the adaptation is an important one.', 'And while Masa upstairs is famous for its $68 white truffle ice cream (that comes on top of a $595 menu), Noodle Bar charges just $29 for something quite similar. Kim shaves a flurry of the fragrant tubers over hozon soft serve, a soy-free analogue to miso. The flavor is pungent at first, then salty, then sweet. It is, like so many other dishes here, an axiomatic argument against the exclusionary pricing that pervades so much of this shopping center.', 'Folks might also try the ramen here, even if it’s not always on par with that of competing venues in nearby Hell’s Kitchen. A longtime quirk of Noodle Bar is that the composed plates have often outperformed the titular speciality. ', 'And just as Dover sole is not replicated in its usual form here, Momofuku’s cadre of chefs shy away from classic ramen nomenclature and flavor profiles, mixing shio with shoyu and throwing in, as Kim tells me, some Korean sensibilities with a little extra chile.', 'The majestic smoked pork ramen — identical to the East Village original — tastes like what would happen if a cook accidentally left a bowl of spicy swine broth next to a barbecue pit. It doesn’t have the same mouthfeel as a richer paitan, but the sensation is akin to slurping up al dente noodles slicked with liquid bacon.', 'Garlic chicken ramen, in turn, conveys salty warmth, with cubes of rotisserie thigh packing a lot more flavor than the neutral, egg-enriched broth. It’s fine, which is more than what one could say about thin beef soup (a skip). Until the black truffle ramen arrives, the bacon-y smoked pork ramen is the move, as is a pile of chile-laced cold noodles. ', 'For dessert, diners can order that white truffle soft serve, or go for the frozen dairy alone. The kitchen also runs a special of pork fat-griddled bang flatbread, sprinkling the pita-like rounds with a coarse cinnamon-sugar blend. The end product, which looks like a floppy frisbee, recalls a smokier version of those doughy Auntie Anne’s dessert pretzels that humans rely on to keep blood insulin levels up during marathon mall sessions. ', 'Therein lies the brilliance of Noodle Bar. Even though it manages to be a unique Chang-brand restaurant — and a venue that self-knowingly chuckles at the surrounding haughtiness — it still has fun riffing on the fact that it’s just a place to eat while shopping.', 'Cost: Steamed buns at $8 to $13; small plates at $10 to $23; and noodles at $16 to$19. Oxtail with rice cakes is $32; whole Dover sole is $43.

22,"['Cédric Vongerichten’s first restaurant without his famous father is an Indonesian stunner in Nolita', 'At the chef’s counter at Wayan, Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten’s stunner of an Indonesian restaurant, a waiter pours a glass of Champagne as cooks tend to sizzling satays. Skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. But from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. The chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. This is unexpected. ', 'Indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. Its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to Dutch to Middle Eastern to Indian to Polynesian to Chinese. But broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. It’s a style of cooking New York restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the Standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at Nargis. ', 'And yet at Wayan in Nolita, due to fire code issues, the team executes this Southeast Asian staple via a European-style griddle. The skewers do not suffer from the adaptation. ', 'If chicken satays sound boring, consider this: The thigh meat exhibits the silkiness of tofu, while a beige peanut sauce flaunts the richness of cream. It’s like blanquette de veau on a stick, albeit energized with coconut and red curry. Pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. And sticks of Florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ', 'Ochi, a Jakarta native involved in everything from menu development to tableware, and her chef-husband Cédric, have given New York a thrilling addition to its contemporary Southeast Asian scene. Like Uncle Boons, Kopitiam, Jeepney, and elsewhere, Wayan shows off compelling strains of modernity rooted in tradition.', 'Alongside a cilantro-scented filet of steamed bass, the delicate flesh just firmer than custard, a waiter places a single bakwan jagung, a classic corn fritter plated for the social media era. Cédric garnishes the creation with scallions and sits it on a tiny pedestal; the flavor is pure fried chicken skin while the visuals are very El Bulli.', 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, this is the type of restaurant one might have expected from Cédric’s father, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the Franco-American chef who shook up New York gastronomy in the late ’90s and early aughts. From his eponymous Central Park flagship to his clubby Spice Market in the Meatpacking District, he drew upon his days cooking in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong to fuse Asian sensibilities with Continental fare. He flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier Midtown venues. The flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.', 'That style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at Wayan. Cédric, a Bangkok-born chef who also runs Perry St, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. You roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.', 'Particularly breathtaking is sop buntut, Javanese oxtail soup. The broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. On the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. Fancy French chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. And that’s precisely what Cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm Maillard char.', 'Really, if there were any fears about whether Wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the New York restaurant world. The prevailing Jean-Georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to Asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland East-meets-West menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. ', 'Such fears are not entirely unwarranted. Vong Kitchen in Jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” Cédric and Jean-Georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the Wayan menu. There’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in Nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any Nobu or Robuchon in Moscow or Tokyo. There’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. ', 'And then there’s Wayan’s crabcake, garnished with a vertical build of cucumbers and sprouts as if it were one of Alfred Portale’s “tall” dishes from the 1980s. With so many brilliant Southeast Asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why Wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the American country club variety. Make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. But still, it’s disappointing that Cédric, instead of trying to introduce New Yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. ', 'The name Wayan, incidentally, is Balinese; it means first-born. The Tao-ish design (Rockwell Group) is a hat tip to that island as well, with reclaimed wood and hanging vines evoking its vernacular architecture. The decorative spices strewn throughout the restaurant, from cinnamon to star anise, by contrast, feel like an ode to Pottery Barn.', 'More inspirational is the nasi goreng, a must-order. Indonesian meals are often built around rice, and Wayan’s version of the staple is deeply flavorful with the aroma of garlic. Pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of Twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk. ', 'Or for an equally complex starch, the kitchen slicks Chinese-style lamian noodles with kecap manis, a molasses-like soy sauce, as well with a throat-tickling blend of chiles and black peppercorns. For good measure, they also throw in a few chunks of lobster so powerfully flavored one wonders if Cédric found a way to dry-age the crustacean.', 'The dessert of choice is pandan custard, as much a visual triumph as a gustatory one. Cédric pours a layer of passionfruit juice, along with its seeds, along the top layer of the confection. You dip in your spoon as if you were digging into a halved tropical fruit, but what comes out is not yellow flesh but rather oozy, vanilla-laced pudding. The juice acts as an assertive, acidic counterpoint to the indulgent dairy. Jean-Georges also does a bit of trompe l’oeil over on Central Park West, where caviar sits atop what appears to be a lemon — it’s really just citron gelee. Like father, like son, I suppose, but I’ll cast my vote for the cheaper $12 faux fruit! ', 'Cost: Satays at $12-$15; small plates at $12-$19; mains at $24-$29, with one exception: steak is $59. Expect to spend about $100 per person for a fully-loaded meal with two drinks each after tax and tip.', 'Sample dishes: Chicken, pork, and shrimp satays, hearts of palm with mango and passionfruit, Javanese oxtail soup, Indonesian corn fritter, nasi goreng, yellow chicken with coconut milk, steamed black bass with cilantro, baby back pork ribs with tamarind glaze (not too sweet; very well balanced!), pandan custard.']"
23,"['The restaurant is a foil to its flashier upstairs sibling, Estiatorio Milos, offering a far more generous ideation of a mall restaurant', 'To dine at Estiatorio Milos in Hudson Yards, one of the city’s most expensive seafood restaurants, is to witness the efforts of a small army. Over 130 staffers tend to fire-spitting grills, butcher whole fish, turn entire mackerel into tartare a la minute, and carve up turbot tableside in mere moments. To dine downstairs at Milos Wine Bar, however, is to witness a very different ballet, and arguably a more compelling one. ', 'Just two or so chefs prepare every item on the much shorter menu. They slice raw tuna and anoint it with yuzu kosho. They lay a sinuous octopus tentacle on a wicked-hot grill. They drizzle Madagascar prawns with olive oil. They shave succulent pork off a rotating spit for gyros. ', 'For this four-course feast, plus two glasses of wine, tax, and tip, you pay just $88. That much wouldn’t buy you half a lobster pasta upstairs at dinner.', 'I had strong words for Estiatorio Milos shortly after it opened, and again today. No matter how grand (or average) your Mediterranean-tinged meal there might be, you always feel cheated. ', 'Milos Wine Bar is the less opulent endeavor. There’s no view of the Vessel or the Hudson river; the space simply overlooks the mall’s empty interior. But the wine bar is also the more affordable and generous concept. Not a single item rises above $16. That octopus the chef was grilling evidences as much technical expertise as other business-class cephalopods around town. There’s that purplish exterior, like a crisp baguette with suction cups; the middle layer of gelatin, ever-so squishy; and the meaty interior, firm and juicy. All that’s missing is that gas grill “kiss” from upstairs. Here it’s $10. There it’s $32. ', 'Taramasalata, a Greek feat that takes briny cod roe and olive oil and transforms it into a product that’s silkier than hummus, is only available as part of a trio of spreads upstairs. The cost? Thirty-nine dollars. Here, it’s available alone, with warm pita, for $10. ', 'Everything about the wine bar is an axiomatic argument against the absurd pricing of the main dining room.', 'This includes the wines themselves. Milos upstairs offers 11 whites by the glass, more than half of them at $17 or more. Getting ahold of a waiter to order one (or a cocktail) sometimes means eating through half a $100 entree, sans beverage. But the wine bar downstairs offers at least 30 whites (and 37 reds) by the glass, with the bulk below $15; a few hover just below $10. Every selection is Greek, a bonus in a city where Hellenic wines don’t get the representation that they deserve.', 'It’s also a rare menu to offer meaningful tasting notes, detailing the rose-petal notes of a Greek moschofilero (whose high acidity will cut through a sausage like a knife through butter) or the tropical aromas of a malagousia (whose medium tartness doesn’t obliterate the subtleties of raw tuna). The bartender will also offer pre-purchase tastes by default, a courtesy I didn’t encounter upstairs. ', 'There’s a certain irony about the whole setup: The wine bar can offer the type of service and wine selections one might expect from a fancy chef’s counter tasting, while the massive 240-seat dining room, where dinner for two can easily run $500 or more, is more akin to an economy class experience. ', 'That’s the Milos money machine. If you’re a millionaire many times over, and you know precisely what to order, upstairs can be a party. Otherwise, the right move is to hang out down here. Here are a few notes on the menu:', 'Spanakopita: The classic Greek pie, a blend of spinach, feta, and phyllo. The component flavors are stellar; the greens and feta express a vibrant sourness. But the pastry is stale.', 'Madagascar prawns: The $16 single-shrimp version of the larger $39 starter upstairs. The prawn oozes dark, heady juices when the head is removed. Suck out what you can and use soft pita to mop up whatever’s on the plate. The crustacean is cooked masterfully; the salty flesh packs a welcome chew and a midlevel maritime tang.', 'Bigeye tuna: A fat slice of raw tuna on a cracker. The product is unnervingly cold, but the fault feels less egregious at $10, versus the nearly $40 option upstairs. The condiments are louder and brighter here too, with an uppercut of dill and yuzu kosho making a higher-volume, more palate-whetting amuse.', 'Scallop skewers: Just three mollusks on a stick. Here, they’re barely cooked through, exhibiting a precarious balance of scallop sweetness, griddle sting, and maritime brine. ', 'Keftedes: Veal meatballs, plain and simple. The wine bar serves them at room temp, letting the piquant, perfumey dill minced into the meat to express itself with aplomb. These aren’t ultra-juicy balls — they’re easygoing, chewy, fragrant snacks. Consume with beer.\t', 'Loukaniko: Just a big griddled Greek sausage. It’s everything one might expect, a chubby link that’s crisp and snappy on the outside and juicy and herby within.', 'Gyro: At $8, it’s not too much spendier than the streetside version. It was a whisper dry on a recent visit, but that didn’t detract from its overall complexity, porky crispness contrasted against slippery tomato and rich yogurt. Add a hint of hot sauce and you have one of the city’s better gyros.', 'Cost: Small plates at $16 or under, with many dishes at $10 or less.', 'Sample dishes: Taramasalata, big-eye tuna with yuzu kosho, giant Madagascar prawns, keftedakia (Greek meatballs), loukaniko sausage, octopus, pork gyro, Greek yogurt with honey.', 'Bonus tip: The deepest and most interesting wines-by-the-glass selection in all of Hudson Yards. Expect about 80 different pours, with most available for less than $15.']"
24,"['Jenny Kwak is a chef at the top of her game, moving deftly between traditional Korean and actually exciting fusion fare in Park Slope', 'Amid New York’s ever-globalizing culinary scene, a culture of cross-pollination continues to thrive. The city’s finest barbecue shack sells not just Texas brisket but stellar jerk pork. An ambitious Indian spot in Gramercy sends out pitch-perfect tandoori chicken — and guacamole to boot. An Asian rotisserie in Midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox. And now at Haenyeo, a knockout of a Korean hangout in Park Slope, the kitchen whips up bouillabaisse as masterful as that of any Gallic temple. ', 'Chef-owner Jenny Kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic French soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and Pernod. The rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. A filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in Marseille — glutinous rice cakes. Mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. And then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen. The warmth of the stew doubles the urchin’s natural sugars and triples its musk. ', 'At this point you might search for the traditional bouillabaisse accompaniment of croutons with rouille to add a bit of garlicky cream and crunch to the stew. Except there’s none of that here. Kwak instead presents a baguette slathered with seaweed butter. Let it soak in the broth, then appreciate how the sweet nori enriches the mixture.', 'If that’s still too European, Kwak offers more traditional dishes too, from bulgogi to raw fish bibimbap bowls — alongside with Mexican-leaning fundidos and Louisiana-style shellfish. Haenyeo might take its name from the women who free-dive for seafood off of Korea’s Jeju Island, but its approach to cuisine is often decidedly and unabashedly internationalist.', 'Park Slope’s collection of Korean restaurants is still small, which is fitting. That country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of East Village representation there before Kwak and her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. The duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s Korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd Street. The mother-daughter team opened up Dok Suni’s on First Avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.', 'Writers praised their efforts, though they sometimes used language that should’ve come across as troublesome then, as it is now. New York Magazine’s Fran Schumer began her Suni’s review with this slight: “You’d rather have spaghetti than kimchi any day, but there are times when cold pickled cabbage tastes that good.” ', 'New York Times critic William Grimes lauded Kwak’s use of tasting menus to “demystify” Korean food at Do Hwa in the West Village. “For years the city’s Korean restaurants made no concessions to newcomers, who faced a struggle figuring out what the dishes were, how to order them and how to eat them,” he wrote in 2000. ', 'Food will always adapt, but pointing out a particular cuisine’s so-called lack of concessions or instructions is a dicier affair. That said, the Korean restaurant community has evolved over the decades — as have the journalists covering it. It’s been ages since a reviewer has used the word “forbidding” in association with any of these fine venues, or (unnecessarily) mentioned that the waiters “speak English well.”', 'Korean fried chicken is about as ubiquitous as any other style. A certain galbi-slinging barbecue spot in Flatiron is harder to get into than any local steakhouse. A multibillion-dollar real estate complex is selling ’grammable rice cakes shaped like pinwheels. And late last year marked the debut of Haenyeo, whose kitchen exhibits a stunning fluency in alternating between more traditional and more modern, fusion-y preparations. ', 'There’s something profoundly warming about walking past a bustling Al Di La, the Italian pride of Park Slope, and noticing that Haenyeo across the street is no less packed. Miles Davis pipes through the sound system as families eat fried scallops with corn tartare — an “is-it-summer-yet” melange of oceanic and terrestrial sugars — and scallion pancakes; the slices of spicy onion are held together with so little batter they’re effectively modernist tempura sculptures. ', 'The corner space, with handsome brown floor planks, French-style bar stools, and ample natural light, screams neighborhood cafe, and that’s partly the plan. Haenyeo will open for lunch and brunch this summer, serving up coffee and eggs with “jambalaya rice.” For now, it’s dinner only, with a no-reservations policy for most party sizes. The wait on Saturdays can surpass 90 minutes.', 'Anyone who tries the oysters will understand the pulsating crowds. Kwak grills them over hardwood briquettes, a hat tip to the New Orleans heritage of her husband, Terrence Segura, with whom she shares ownership. She’s not the first person to do this in New York, but she might be the most skilled. The Wellfleet bivalves display an aggressive plumpness; they pop with a gentle press of the tongue, gushing with hot seaweed butter.', 'Equally stunning is the rustic-internationalist take on fundido, typically a glorious gut bomb of melted cheese. Here, that ingredient constitutes just the epidermal layer of a deeper, bubbling casserole. Beneath the scorched cheese, an aggressively milky Oaxacan variety, lies a pool of chile sauce and mounds of tteokbokki, oblong Korean rice cakes. Pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface. The combination of flavors and textures — chewy rice cakes, hot peppers, tart sauce, spiced sausage, and stretchy, melty cheese — feels like less of a true fundido and more of a Korean-Mexican riff on baked ziti. ', 'Then, a moment later, Kwak switches gear to modern-refined fare. She serves ordinary grilled mackerel in a very distinct way, by pairing it with square sheets of nori. The mackerel is soft and neutral, boasting gently smoky overtones. It’s borderline boring until you wrap it in seaweed, which imparts the fish with a hint of brine and a crisp, snappy texture. You dunk the hand roll, a striking contrast of white and green, in crimson gochujang paste, lighting up the palate with salt and sweet chiles.', 'The menu has a few minor misses, from run-of-the-mill beef kimchi gyoza — ordinary fried dumplings — to a bland mound of chile-braised tofu. Better are the puffy fried chicken bites laced with jalapenos, as well as the Korean seafood stew, a smaller, more classic answer to the fancier bouillabaisse. The soup, chock full of silky soybean curd and firm shrimp, is milder in flavor than the spendier French version, sporting just a touch of shellfish concentrate. And then there is the classic soy-and-sesame-marinated ribeye bulgogi, cut paper-thin and piled high on a platter for wrapping in crisp lettuce and shiso leaves.', 'Louisiana-style beignets are the appropriate way to end a meal here. The dough itself is relatively unsweetened, giving the confections the taste of a classic street-fair zeppole. So much powdered sugar is applied that you will inhale some as you eat. ', '“Not Korean” is the disclaimer that Kwak appends to her Instagrams of that dessert. “For me, staying true or preserving Korean flavors is the main goal,” the chef writes in an email. But she adds that “there are so many influences around me, mostly from traveling but even from living in NYC,” that she allows herself more room to experiment than she did earlier in career. May she continue to do so.', 'Cost: Starters at $9-$16; larger share plates at $16-$34. Seaweed baguette is a (worthwhile) $6 supplement to the $29 bouillabaisse.', 'Sample dishes: Sauteed glass noodles in sesame, rice cake fundido with chorizo, scallion pancake, grilled oysters with seaweed butter, grilled mackerel with nori, spicy winter bouillabaisse, thinly sliced ribeye with lettuce wraps, sugar-dusted beignets.', 'Bonus tip: Reservations only available for six or more; the best way to avoid the wait is to dine earlier in the week, in the off hours, or best of all, at the bar, where things are first come, first served.', '', '']"
25,"['The Riddler and Air’s earn two stars apiece for their accessible bubbly selections and stellar food', 'My general advice for caviar coincides with my maxim for top-shelf Champagne: Don’t order either at restaurants. The only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of Dom Perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. To truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. It needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. A sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like Air’s by Ariel Arce or the Riddler by Jen Pelka, two Village wine bars that make caviar and Champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.', 'There’s something particularly fancy about dropping by Air’s, located in a bustling MacDougal Street townhouse. Green palm fronds rise up from the marble bar. Red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. Teal lights shine behind cases of wine. And diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. Caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. But here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. Baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. The beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. ', 'And just as cookies call for milk, caviar necessitates sparkling wine to gently scrub the palate of all the oceanic salts. Air’s can help in this regard, offering six Champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. At the Riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. True, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.', 'Clockwise, from top left: Ariel Arce, owner of Air’s; Riddler chef Nikole Morsink, wine director Jonathan Adkisson, and owner Jen Pelka; platters of king crab and caviar at Air’s', 'As the new decade approaches, Manhattan feels more and more like a museum gift shop of basic-level fanciness: money, finance bros, Tetris-like skyscrapers on Billionaires’ Row, wagyu-laden steakhouses, and bluefin-hawking sushi dens. That’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. Mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.', 'Air’s and the Riddler rank among those venues — sort of. The interventionist methods used to produce Champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” But the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. ', 'Arce and Pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower Champagnes or other progressive wines. What makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like Krug and Billecart-Salmon to spendier bottle selections.', 'Despite their commonalities, these are two very different venues: The Riddler, which debuted in San Francisco, hawks airy Zalto stems on its website, while Air’s sells discount caviar on its site. Composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at Le Bernardin make up the bulk of the Riddler’s food menu, but Air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. One of them is très bougie. The other one is less bougie. Both are quite good.', 'Shortly after opening, Air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. That translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “Our goal is to expose as much Champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” Arce, a Hell’s Kitchen native, told Eater a few years back. Accordingly, a Jacques Lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “Queen Bae Beyonce Chardonnay,” per Air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.', 'Like Terroir in Tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. It explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. Air’s is correct here: The faint sweetness in the rose Champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. And whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a J.L. Vergnon Murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.', 'Shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. The pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. The eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from Southern U.S. waters. The delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. ', 'Clockwise, from top, all from the Riddler: A shellfish platter with shrimp and hamachi; white truffle risotto with Parmesan; and the dining room during service', '“We want to be a neighborhood spot that people can come to a couple times a week. That’s why we’re doing a burger,” Riddler’s founder and owner Jen Pelka told Eater NY this year, adding: “But we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” It’s possible, of course, that Pelka has a Silicon Valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. My first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of Champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.', 'Here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “Ask a sommelier for a 100 Club Scorecard to track all of the bottles of Champagne you try,” the document reads. “Those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a Riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” That proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from Starbucks to Sweetgreen, has a rewards program. ', 'But since there’s just a single bottle of Champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club. That all sounds about right for a dining room with a gold-leaf ceiling.', 'The Riddler, by any yardstick, is expensive. Then again, the haute-sparkling-wine stratosphere operates by its own ridiculous value equations. At any ambitious American or Gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of Champagne for less than $30, so the fact that Pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. Among those fizzy wines is a Gonet-Medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit LaCroix.', 'With beverages like this, chef Nikole Morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single Champagne. It’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. But Morsink, formerly at the Modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.', 'Take the king crab. So many restaurants fall back on serving the regal crustacean as is, in its own shell. Morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. The result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.', 'Shrimp cocktail gets a salt-and-pepper treatment, leading to a pile of barely-cooked-through shellfish with a sharp, saline punch. Roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, French. Morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. Think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of Noel Bazin brut rose ($25). ', 'White truffle risotto, at $42, will count for some as an unaffordable extravagance. But in this realm of luxury dining, it’s a heck of a deal when versions of the dish can command $135 or more. Each creamy grain snaps with an al dente bite, a whiff of brown butter, a punch of Parmesan, and the ephemeral pungency of pricey fungi. ', 'Caviar is reliable and not too spendy. The large-beaded kaluga variety ($78) sports a soft texture and mild seafaring flavor; discard the chips and creme fraiche, which overwhelm the delicate eggs. Better is the faux dessert roe. Pot de creme arrives in a round tin, affirming the venue’s nouveau-patrician leanings. Crunchy chocolate balls and bitter caramel sit over a layer of salted and sour vanilla creme fraiche. ', 'The Riddler is far from the first restaurant to serve pretend caviar, but it might rank among the most adept; the mix of crunch, saline punch, and astringent sugar makes the frequently leaden dessert feel light, complex, and whimsical. It costs just $11, which suggests bespoke desserts are undervalued with regard to widely available wines. No matter. It’s a modest price to pay to spend another 10 minutes or so on a chic corner of the West Village, with giant windows overlooking a leaf-strewn Bank Street.', 'Cost: Champagnes by the glass at $20 or under, with at least 50 bottles under $100. Caviar is priced by the half ounce and starts at $25 for Grinnell, going up to $55 for Siberian.', 'Sample dishes: Caviar sandwich, chilled king crab with brown butter, caviar service with chips, grilled cheese sandwich with mostarda and lemon honey, assorted charcuterie.', 'Bonus tip: Service can be a bit scattered in the dining room during prime time. The best seats, accordingly, are at the bar, which is conveniently located away from the drafty doorway.', 'Cost: Seven Champagnes by the glass at $20 to $28, with a shorter selection of sparkling wines at $14 to $16. Champagnes by the bottle, while fairly-priced, mostly run $100 or more, though there are a few pét-nats in the $70 to $85 range. Appetizers are $16 to 21; larger plates are $16 to $42; caviar is $78.', 'Sample dishes: Kaluga caviar, king crab with almonds, shrimp cocktail, white truffle risotto, halibut with chanterelles and green shiso, pot de creme with salted caramel and crispy chocolate.', 'Bonus tip: Riddler can get quite busy during prime time; those seeking a table should book ahead via Resy.']"

Marchand — who helped dress down fine dining at Frenchie in Paris — is guest chef until the end of March. After that, another chef will take over, and then another every four to six months.

The fact that Meyer operates it without the same financial constraints of a traditional venue, as a manager mentioned to me, means it can afford to experiment a bit more.', 'The Catalan avant-gardist Ferran Adrià, who operated El Bulli in Spain at a loss, famously toyed with the idea of a corporate-backed space. Museums and opera houses have historically relied on the patronage of rich benefactors — not just ticket prices — to fund new exhibits and productions. So couldn’t the same work for restaurants if the arrangement encourages risk? If it highlights new or out-of-town talent? In theory, yes.', 'Executive chef Nickolas Martinez; pastry chef Kazuo Fujimura; foie gras with pastrami', 'Marchand — whose vision is executed on a day-to-day basis by executive chef Nickolas Martinez and pastry chef Kazuo Fujimura — crafts the type of visually stunning and modern dishes one might expect from a tasting temple charging $600 for two. Here, a great meal costs about $200.', 'The kitchen aces buttery rectangles of foie gras with long slices of pastrami, redolent with the scent of clove. Smear it on a slice of sourdough, and the result is an open-faced spiced meat sandwich that would make a convert out of even the most devoted patron of Katz’s. ', 'So many chefs use raw fish to show off skillful knife work — turning raw tuna into geometrically perfect squares or rectangles. Marchand and Martinez prefer to practice their hammering skills, pounding fluke into a carpaccio that takes up as many square inches as schnitzel. The fish is neutral and translucent; it acts as a clean delivery mechanism for salt, greens, and crispy quinoa.', 'Martinez also finds textural correspondence with a bowl of mushrooms, gnocchi, and sweetbreads. Every morsel, simultaneously rich yet packed with acid, yields to a soft chew. ', 'A giant cross-section of cauliflower sits underneath a crumble of seeds, nuts, and dates. You cut it like a steak and drag the florets through a curried puree of the vegetable. And an (oversized) duck breast flaunts a sesame-honey-glazed skin that seems to shatter like candy when cut; quenelles of sunchoke puree impart a haunting smokiness. ', 'As for the desserts, Fujimura serves the type of technically advanced yet delicious sweets that wouldn’t feel out of place at a three-Michelin-starred spot like Le Bernardin, where he once worked.', 'He takes banoffee, a dense and caloric British pie, and transforms it into a cloud, piping a dulce de leche foam over banana ice cream and compote. One doesn’t eat it as much as inhale it. And he makes a Mont Blanc to end all Mont Blancs. Spaghetti-like swirls of chestnut cream surround a base of creme fraiche chantilly — nothing out of the ordinary there. But at the base is a mound of candied chestnut, an unusual addition that adds a warming, chewy savoriness. And on top of the tiny “mountain” is another twist: a dollop of yuzu-yogurt sorbet, cutting through the sweetness. ', 'It doesn’t do too much good to go on too long about a menu that will change entirely this spring, but it’s worth musing upon some larger aspects of the space — and the Lexus agenda — that bode less well for sponsored culinary establishments.', 'Restaurants are many things, but they don’t historically act as lifestyle ambassadors for brands whose products many of their own patrons will never be able to afford. Alas, in the past few years, New York has seen Blue Box Cafe, which sells a $32 “Breakfast at Tiffany” inside the jeweler’s flagship, and La Mercerie at Roman and Williams Guild, where hosts advise guests to browse a store selling $16,000 couches.', 'The self-proclaimed purpose of Intersect, which also has locations in Tokyo and Dubai, is to act as a “unique, permanent space in select global cities where people can experience the ethos of the Lexus lifestyle without getting behind the steering wheel of one of our cars.” It’s not a mantra that screams “restaurant” or “hospitality.” ', 'Perhaps this is why everything feels a little different here. Bathrooms lie behind two sets of space-age sliding doors; toilets come equipped with heated seats. Cool. Anyone who uses those restrooms must pass by that SUV — not to mention a video installation showing sleepy b-roll of that car. It’s... less cool. And since Lexus supports “local and international artisans as they develop their trade,” a retail area sells $350 sunglasses and a reinterpretation of a soccer ball for $410. ', 'The main dining room is a window-free affair, accented with off-white bookshelves, light-brown woods, and a generic open kitchen. The space is as removed from the city as an upscale airline concessioner in Denver, Las Vegas, or Cincinnati.', 'Lexus should find a way to move at least part of the dining room to street level, imparting a sense of vibrancy to a stretch of Manhattan that’s often bereft of pedestrians after 8 p.m. Instead, all that passers-by see is that cafe space, which can appear as barren as the retail shops nearby. A restaurant should foster a sense of community. The community defined by Intersect feels like a sterile world dreamed up by a wealthy baby boomer from the suburbs. It feels built for aging Lexus owners, with the sound system piping out Billy Joel, Petula Clark, and Jackson Browne.', 'And that brings up the menu format. Marchand is one of the leading members of the French bistronomie movement, which generally favors small plates (or tasting menus) in casual, affordable-ish settings. It’s a movement that helped bring a more personal and accessible approach to ambitious dining to Paris, and it paved the way for auteur-esque New York venues like Estela or Contra.', 'Intersect, by contrast, takes the brilliant cooking of Marchand but confines it to a clunky three-course menu. It’s as if the pulsating urgency of Parisian gastronomy is being retrofitted for a stereotypically fancy restaurant in Manhasset, Long Island.', 'So can a sponsored restaurant work? Yes, but the model needs tweaking. Intersect claims it wants to be an “immersive cultural experience,” and to “to engage, inspire and stimulate young creators whose ideas will shape our tomorrow,” and that’s great! But for now, the only “programming” listed for cultural experience is the Valentine’s Day prix fixe, as well as an offer to “meet the vehicle combining high performance with unrestrained luxury.” It’s referring, of course, to the car in the lobby.', 'Cost: Starters at $18-$22; mains at $27-$46; desserts at $13. Bar snacks and plates run $8-$24. All prices are service-included; there is no tipping.', 'Sample dishes:  Fluke carpaccio with crispy quinoa and beets; foie gras with pastrami; gnocchi with sweetbreads and mushrooms; cauliflower with nuts, seeds, dates, and curry; duck with sesame, sunchoke, salsify, and tatsoi; yuzu Mont Blanc, tarte tatin with cardamom cream.', 'Bonus tip:  The cafe space, during the day, is a much more pleasant space than Starbucks Reserve Roastery to type away on a laptop with a cup of coffee and a pastry. The cafe, unfortunately, is card-only, like the restaurant.', 'Critic’s note: This review is presented without stars due to the regular chef changes']"
27,"['California’s noble attempt at sustainable meat is poorly executed, with bland burgers and underseasoned steak', 'In the West Coast meat world, few names carry the import of Belcampo. Anya Fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. She achieves such nobility through vertical integration; Belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert Temple Grandin. According to a New Yorker feature titled “Can Steak Save the Planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. The grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” The company even holds O magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. ', 'Belcampo’s East Coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into New York’s meat scene. It is not. The restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of Hudson Yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. ', 'The concept is admittedly a welcome one here in Hudson Yards, a development where a single ribeye can run over $100.', 'Belcampo is where you go when you don’t have a reservation elsewhere or when the family is with you. The dining room piece de resistance is a giant glowing sign above the bar that says “BELCAMPO.” It is a very branded ambience.', 'This does not seem like the Belcampo Jonathan Gold once wrote about. The late, great, Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. Other West Coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. There are no such wonders at the Hudson Yards Belcampo. This is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. This is shopping food. ', 'The standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. Grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; I recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. Belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. Virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. ', 'The progressive farm-to-table ethos does not extend to the beverages. Anyone pairing their beef with a nice red will encounter a fairly generic cabernet, pinot, or syrah. It will be served warm. You will not see the bottle, never mind get a pre-purchase taste. There are no funky orange whites to pair with any of the sustainable fare.', 'Still, there are some gems. When it opened, Fernald said that she expected most of her customers to be people who live and work at Hudson Yards. If you’re one of those people — or if you’re someone who simply ends up at the mall without a reservation — here’s a rundown of what to order and what to avoid. ', 'Tartare or carpaccio: These are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. The carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. Flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. The meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. As for the tartare, it’s better than Thomas Keller’s more luxe version at nearby TAK Room. Neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. Most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. ', 'Duck poutine: Fries get slicked in beef gravy and topped with crispy bits of duck thigh here. The flavors seamlessly align with their component ingredients. The meat is gamey. The fries are crispy — until they turn gorgeously soggy near the bottom — and the gravy is umami-rich. The cheese curds are firm and clean, providing a respite from all the salty, nourishing goodness. ', 'Chicken Caldo: This is a nourishing and affordable soup. For $12, you get a giant bowl of poultry bone broth laced with lime and tinged with warming achiote. Heady forkfuls of shredded thigh meat float alongside big slices of avocado.', 'Tallow Fries: This $12 side comes fried in either duck fat or beef fat. Neither, however, exhibit the multilayered flavor profile of a proper tallow fry. They’re just run-of-the-mill, above-average frites, crispy on the outside and fluffy within.', 'Merguez sausage: Juicy and smoky, the sausage boasts a clean snap. A solid $8 side.', 'Lamb burger: This is the only good burger here ($16). The lean meat isn’t as rich or silky as the famed Breslin version, but that also means it’s easier on the digestive system. Each bite provides a medium punch of salt and funk, while alfalfa sprouts impart a touch of pleasant grassiness. Just one problem: The cooks apply so much drippy aioli that the bun instantly turns to mush. ', 'Satay chicken salad: This includes smoky grilled breast meat over a pile of lettuce varnished with sweet-sour dressing. Push aside the mushy cherry tomatoes. This isn’t quite an ode to the aromatic skewers of Indonesia, but for mall food,it gets the job done. ', 'Regular fries: Underseasoned and undercooked ($6). They’re a fine advertisement for the $12 tallow fries, which are really your only option here. ', 'Tallow tenderloin: Tenderloin prepared correctly can be a wonderful thing. But at Belcampo, the butchers’ effort to age the cut in tallow is in vain: The filet ($56) channels its reputation as the bland chicken breast of the bovine world. The overcooked interior is barely salvaged by a sticky veal reduction sauce. ', 'Charcoal-rubbed ribeye: Imagine the flavor of a regular ribeye, but deprived of silky fats or deep flavor ($80). My meals here were possibly the first time I’ve ever experienced a steak that’s simultaneously medium rare and dessicated. The level of salt is so high that the steak tastes cured. The exterior cap, often the most flavorful and succulent part of the steak, has been  overcooked to the point of Dracarys-style carbonization. ', 'Double Fast: This is the restaurant’s classic double burger ($12). The kitchen manages to incinerate the meat in such a way that it’s entirely gray and overcooked within. On one visit, the exterior was bereft of a salty char, while on another, there was excellent char, but still no salt or beefiness. The dominant flavor profile is mustard.', 'Dry-aged burgers: The 28-day patty is a thoroughly average entry into the crowded restaurant-burger field ($16). The underseasoned meat isn’t quite dry, but it isn’t juicy either. A mound of caramelized onions and white cheddar provide the bulk of the flavor, while the meat itself it little different from any generic diner burger. The 100-day burger ($28) boasts almost zero dry-aged flavor. It’s just a pile of tender meat on a bun, undercooked to the point of mimicking the texture of pate. If you’re going to spend this much on a burger, go to Minetta Tavern. ', 'Cost: Most starters, bowls, and soups at $18 or less. Burgers at $12 (double patty), $16 (dry-aged beef or lamb), $28 (extra-aged). Steaks start at $28 and go way up from there.', 'Sample dishes: Beef tartare, beef carpaccio, Belcampo charcuterie, duck confit poutine, all-day breakfast sandwich, achiote chicken soup, steak frites, assorted burgers, and a lamb shawarma salad called “The Vessel.”', 'Bonus tip: The right order here is an order of duck poutine and beef tartare (or carpaccio). For a classic fast food burger, the better option is Shack Shack around the corner.']"

', 'A server approaches your table and invites you to browse a selection of seafood. The options look immaculate. Small mountains of ice hold a seafaring selection not often seen in New York: emperor fish, with anime eyes and a millenial-pink sheen. Carabinero shrimp, as unnaturally red as a Coca-Cola can. Rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest Jurassic Park film. This is where you choose your dinner — a process that occurs, almost universally, after you’ve plowed through half a pomegranate daiquiri. It’s the maritime equivalent of shopping for engagement rings with a glass of bubbly. ', 'You almost don’t notice when a waiter recommends you kick off the meal with langoustines that runs $102 per pound. Besides, there’s no way he’ll give you anything close to a pound. Right?', 'Make no mistake: You have been primed for a shakedown, Cartier-style. ', 'One of the holy grails of modern fine dining has been finding a way to de-emphasize the transactional experience of a meal. The culinary arts have always been uniquely handicapped in this sense. Opera would have a different feel if a soprano kicked off the evening by telling spectators “this aria is going to cost you a ton,” and then sent out a check to everyone at the end of the night.', 'Some of America’s most expensive restaurants have solved this problem via a ticketing system, having guests pay for meals in advance. Milos takes a different tack, obscuring as many prices as possible throughout the course of an evening. ', 'The saga starts back at that tour. The captains sing nuanced praises for the barbounia, fagi, and lavraki. They know which ones are oily, which ones are buttery, and that there’s “not much cheek meat in the turbot.” They know every detail — except for the prices, a subject they avoid so diligently that one wonders whether these veritable ichthyologists skipped a very specific day of school.', 'By-the-pound prices are posted above most fish. That price, though, means you’re looking not at the actual cost but the raw data for an incomplete math equation. Either way, you’re paying more attention to the waiter’s musings on the Milos yacht (which you can apparently rent in the Aegean Sea), or how a two-and-a-half-pound lobster would be nice for a solo diner. The lobsters bear no price tags, which is dangerous for a main that costs more than round-trip airfare to Chicago.', 'You return to your linen-clad table and ask for two langoustines and a turbot. The server says the whole fish is three pounds. You know the price is $56 per pound — you were smart enough to take notes — so you figure you’ll be out $160. And yet, when the bill comes, the price is $197. That can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil. Then you take a closer look at the check and notice the fish is half a pound heavier than the waiter told you it would be. Whoops!', 'Those langoustines, in turn, boast a sweet, gas-grilled aroma, though they lack the intense, oceanic aroma these crustaceans have elsewhere. You didn’t inquire about the price, because you got tired of asking “How much do these actually cost?” You figured a few prawns would cost less than caviar service. You figured wrong. They’re a cool $87 for an appetizer’s worth of meat. This is when you start to spew expletives. ', 'The well-heeled might find this system unobtrusive, and perhaps there’s something honest about assigning a very specific price to an individual fish based on its weight. There’s also a certain elegance in convincing guests to part with a few extra dollars and make them feel like it was worth it. ', 'But everyday gourmands might find something disingenuous about implementing that system in such a way that dinner ends up costing you $100 more than you budgeted for. Constant incongruities on a bill at Milos feel more like the work of an unscrupulous bookie than an honest act of hospitality. ', 'The food, too, does not always deliver on unexpectedly ballooned costs. The carabinero prawns — a receptionist told me I’d pay $30 apiece; the bill charged $40 — tasted like shellfish to the power of 10, but a lobster pasta in which diced tail meat gets tossed into a sherry cream sauce did little better than neighborhood restaurants that charge almost four times less. With two medium-sized claws, the middling dish arrived on the bill at $189. ', 'Instead, order the soft-shell crab. At $27 apiece, they’re a heck of a price, but the cooks do them right, pan-frying them in a way that seems to preserve their briny juices better than elsewhere. The best way to hit Milos, though, is to sit at the bar, order a pound of the rarely-seen-in-NYC fried red mullets, and tear away at the small fish with a buddy. The impossibly sweet flesh, when it’s not overcooked, recalls the fragrant, mineral aromas of the Mediterranean.', 'That’s the thing about Milos. You can have a reasonably grand meal here. You can have a reasonably average meal here. And yet the one constant is that on every visit, you feel cheated.', 'Walnut cake with ice cream, goat’s milk yogurt with thyme honey, Greek ceviche, and other dishes from Estiatorio Milos', 'Spiliadis has been at this for a while now. He opened his first Milos in Montreal in 1979, followed that up with a Midtown Manhattan location in 1997, and replicated those efforts in London, Vegas, and Seattle. If nothing else, his New York stalwart deserves credit for occupying a very specific role in the fine dining community; the city’s most expensive restaurants have long focused on manipulating, refining, and saucing food, while Milos has always been the ultimate pure product emporium, minimally adorning fish and serving them grilled, pan-fried, or salt-baked. If done right, like it is at Bartolotta in Las Vegas, this style of dining can be quite wonderful. ', 'At Hudson Yards, it feels more like an ode to Long Island dining. That is to say: You can pay a lot of money for a lot of forgettable food while hanging with a bunch of middle-aged guys in leather jackets jockeying for the bartender’s attention.', 'This isn’t exactly Danny Meyer generosity or ambience, either. Hosts don’t say goodbye. The guy who pours you a drink won’t transfer your tab. And the ambience evokes a cheap cruise with obstructed views; the lighting is so poor that the panoramic windows do a better job at reflecting back the dining room than providing a view of the Hudson.', 'I suppose I could have devoted an equally long essay to service issues — to the fact that one can eat the bulk of that lobster without a wine or cocktail, because you couldn’t flag down a waiter. To the fact that you can go 60 minutes after arriving without food because the restaurant is overbooked and the waiters ignore you after you’re seated. To the fact that you might get a table overlooking the mall. ', 'Thing is, we’re all familiar with these stories; stereotypically bad restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city. I highlight the opaque pricing because an unsuspecting diner could really get taken here. And that is what makes Milos a uniquely bad restaurant.

', 'At a proper fine dining establishment, the kitchen never sends out a fat slice of wagyu or butter-poached lobster as a first course, nor does a tasting of yakitori or Korean barbecue typically begin with the namesake items. A chef likes to whet the palate with a starter or two before moving onto more substantial fare, as a series of energizing coming attractions precedes a good action flick at the movies.', 'But at Rezdôra, things are more direct. The tasting is just pasta. That means no fanciful appetizers, intermezzos, or, as is the case at Babbo, passionfruit dessert spaghetti. The night begins with noodles and, unless you order a lousy gelato or olive oil cake, the evening ends with noodles.', 'Mortadella-stuffed tortellini, each no bigger than a wedding ring, float about in a cloudy broth of capon (a castrated male chicken). The saline and sausage notes spark one’s appetite. That’s followed by maccheroni con pomodoro, wherein a bit of Parmesan imparts a zippy tomato sauce with a round, MSG-like savoriness. The feast crescendos with a fistful of ethereal tagliolini al ragu — more on that in a bit — and then finishes with anolini, little ham-stuffed ravioli covered in Parmesan fondue. A server drizzles 25-year balsamic all over them, a dark, agrodolce counterpart to the stark white sauce. It’s not quite dessert, but it’s enough of a cheese course to serve as the meal’s logical coda.', 'A pasta tasting, at its worst, is a gut bomb of a meal, but here at Rezdôra, the format recalls the lightness and ingenuity of a sushi omakase. That is to say: Each course is just a few bites, with subtle variations in richness, umami, and acidity expressing themselves within the confines of a form that might otherwise seem repetitive to a casual observer. Chef Stefano Secchi’s ability to make this feel like a complete meal, with all its fluctuations, suggests he’s only beginning to show off his true potential.', 'Rezdôra, which also offers a la carte selections under $30, marks a vital moment in the state of New York Italian dining. It represents a rare high-profile Big Apple restaurant led by a noted alum from Osteria Francescana. That three-Michelin-starred temple in Modena, led by the charismatic Massimo Bottura, is famous for its avant-garde approach to the foods of Emilia-Romagna. Think: a lemon tart that recalls a Jackson Pollock painting, or a dish called “Eel swimming up the Poe river,” which Bottura claims is “both recipe and fable.”', 'Alas, the only real resemblance Rezdôra bears to Francescana are the whimsical names of certain dishes. There’s “Cow grazing in Emilia” for a simple course of Creekstone beef. The cut sports a straightforward bovine punch and a neat little herb salad. “Grandma walking through forest,” in turn, is the long-winded moniker for green cappelletti. The noodles, which look like the cute conical hats that Robin Hood wore in the 1973 Disney cartoon, are topped with verdant spring peas, stuffed with sweet ricotta, and placed atop an earthy mash of black fungi. This is your salad course.', 'If Francescana is all about modernism, Rezdôra leans more smartly classical. This jibes with New York’s larger gastronomic pulse, which tends to favor technique, regionalism, culinary straightforwardness, and sleepy steakhouses over chemistry-like wizardry. But neither that reality nor the generic design of the dining room — plank floors, exposed brick, cramped two-tops, a white marble bar — detracts from the precise rustic cooking that occurs here every night.', 'When one thinks of Emilia-Romagna, a Northern Italian region that lies between the Po River and the Apennine Mountains, staples like Parmesan, prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, truffles, and ragu bolognese come to mind. Rezdôra delivers on all these fronts — and with more refinement than at, say, Michael White’s Osteria Morini, which pledges allegiance to the same region.', 'Clockwise, from upper left: Stracciatella with Vignola cherries, sirloin with herb salad, gnocco fritto and cured meats, and cappelleti with spring peas and black mushroom puree', 'A charcuterie board will deliver all of the above in one fell swoop, but the gnocco fritto is the smarter delivery mechanism for these delicacies. Golden orbs of pita-like puffed bread sit below piles of salumi, their nuttiness heightened by the warmth of the boulangerie. Emilia-Romagna is also known for its insanely plump Vignola cherries, which Stecchi pairs with a sufficiently milky (and tiny) pile of stracciatella.', 'One could go on about those dishes, or the softly braised rabbit, matched with glazed veal sweetbreads. Really, though, the primary purpose of a trip to Rezdôra is pasta. About four portions make a light meal for two. Order any of them, from the spaghetti vongole, slicked in a clam sauce as concentrated as a quart of boiled ocean water, to the infrequently seen doppio tortelli. The latter holds salty prosciutto and oozy Parmesan foam in two separate “tubes.” Eating one, slicked in truffle butter, is like chomping on an Italian riff on a soup dumpling; when bit, it squirts out warm sauce with abandon.', 'Now let’s talk about that ragu. ', 'Though often considered a straightforward dish, ragu famously became an exercise in the avant-garde with Bottura, who once asked “Could a plate of tagliatelle [al ragu] be at the vanguard in the same way as an abstraction of Parmigiano-Reggiano?” His restaurant elevated the staple by cooking the meats — which include beef cheek and veal tail — sous-vide for 24 hours, and it became one of his best-known dishes. Anyone who’s fallen in love with the cooking of Bottura will want to know how Rezdôra compares.', 'Secchi’s recipe is different. He simmers a blend of soffrito, pork shoulder, mortadella, ground pork, and salumi for eight hours with Parmesan sachets. When a patron orders the tagliolini, the kitchen emulsifies it in just a hint of tomato sauce and extra-virgin olive oil. ', 'The cooking is finished in the sauce itself. The same could be said of any pasta, but what makes that technique so powerful here is the thinness of the tagliolini. Al dente isn’t the point. These are softer and stretchier, closer to the texture of rice vermicelli. They’re designed to absorb that wonderful ragu. ', 'Some nights the sauce is thicker and pinker; other evenings, the slurry is looser. But on each visit, the ragu — smooth and devoid of coarse chunks — exhibits nuclear-level meatiness. One doesn’t necessarily taste the flavors of the component salumi; the experience rather conveys an otherworldly level of carnivorous umami. It will make your gums tingle. However rustic its sheen, the dish is as worthy of worship as any of the painterly creations coming out of the kitchen at Atomix.', 'The same, alas, cannot be said of the sweets. Gelati, from pistachio to stracciatella, sport a thin, almost icy texture and forgettable, saccharine flavors. In a city with so many good ice cream purveyors, Secchi should just ditch his product, which wouldn’t pass muster at a 7-Eleven. Generically soft olive oil cake, about on par with something from Entenmann’s, gets the job done with mediocrity, as does a passable tiramisu. ', 'This is a bad dessert program. Better just to leave here dreaming of that ragu and relishing in the fact that despite the city’s ultra-crowded Italian scene, Rezdôra already ranks near the top.', 'Cost: Starters at $19 or under; pastas at $19 to $24; mains at $28 to $31; tasting menu at $90.

I was pretty stupid.', 'My second piece of advice about the banya, a Slavic sweat-bathing tradition for over 1,000 years, is that you will eat well there. This is particularly true at Spa 88 in FiDi, a two decade-old sanitarium where people in bathing suits feast on some of the city’s finest former Soviet  Union fare. I’ve been schvitzing here for the better part of a decade, a love affair that began because another one ended. Briefly: She moved out of my place and into his. And the banya is where I went to recover.

And while the ultimate result is that you will, at some point during your multi-hour session, become wonderfully relaxed, the process of getting there is a rigorous mental and metabolic affair.', 'Spa 88’s narrow entrance, located next to a pawn shop on Fulton, belies the expansiveness of this subterranean behemoth. It packs a lap pool, a cigar room, a jacuzzi that’s hogged by non-Russian speakers, a juice bar that hawks dried fish, massage rooms, cold rooms, a restaurant, a cafe, and four hot rooms, each of which tax the body with very specific degrees of heat and pain. ', 'The infrared sauna (lolz: “bulletproof your immune system”) is the most useless of the three. Better to start off with the Turkish bath, foggy with crisp eucalyptus steam, before moving on to the old American schvitz, where people dump buckets of water over themselves to prolong the pain. Then graduate to the dry Russian sauna. Here, the temperature is so hot (180 F or higher), it can start to melt a plastic container, releasing its toxins. If you bring in a water bottle, you will be admonished.', 'Some patrons slather their faces in honey, which Russians historically believe is a natural detoxifier and skin softener. Others might hire a man with military-grade forearms to whip them with wet oak branches, resulting in the leaves releasing “organic phytoncides, infection inhibitors, decreasing the growth and development of pathogens in the body,” per the banya. This treatment, known as platza, perfumes the surrounding benches with the scent of a damp forest.', 'On a Saturday afternoon, you sit closer to people than you would at a communal table. Except here, people don’t have shirts on. Here, you sweat. Your perspiration starts off as a damp treadmill dew, salutary evaporation to keep your exterior cool. But as the minutes pass, your sweat becomes more viscous, mixing with the skin-softening secretions of your sebaceous glands. It’s as if a light film of olive oil is slicking your entire body.', 'Then you jump into the cold plunge. You scream. You warm up in the sauna again. You repeat this process so many times that your nerve endings start to tingle and go numb; it is the epidermal analogue to Sichuan-style mala. And then you eat. The sweet musk of kharcho — a spicy Georgian lamb soup — is detectable from across the table. The broth is the color of gravy. Rice adds starchiness; whole peppercorns add fire. It is hearty without being rich, seasoned without being salty. It lets patrons return to the hot room without burdening the digestive system or blurring the senses. So you go back in and sweat.', 'From top left: The cafe at Spa 88; showering after the hot room; heading back into the sauna.', 'The banya serves as a respite from the traditional restaurant dining experience, an enjoyable if restrictive construct where patrons are shunted to a bar until the party is complete, directed to a table for dining, presented a check upon request, and then expected to leave with haste. ', 'At the spa, your companions do not need to arrive at the same time as you do, a convenience that holds true at literally any bathhouse, from the century-old East Village one, to the sprawling banya in Seagate, to the Korean Spa Castle in Queens. Patrons aren’t pinned to their chairs, either; you can wander around without eight staffers asking whether you need help. And you can stay so long that it’s not unreasonable to have two separate meals during one visit.', 'The banya is the antithesis to the safe two-drink date. It is showing up at Balthazar for lunch and leaving after dinner.', 'Much of the same could be said of food halls and venues like Starbucks Reserve Roastery, which function as stay-as-long-as-you-want coworking spaces while hawking expensive pour-over coffee and artisanal pastries. But still, the banya is different from those all-day venues in that the gastronomy is even further removed from the equation. ', 'This is why dining at the bathhouse recalls dining at baseball games, football games, bowling alleys, municipal pools, arcades, mess halls on ski slopes, or this really weird alligator zoo in Florida where they fed me fried gator. The banya reminds me of how I used to eat before I ate for a living, which is to say at places where food was a vital part of a larger activity, not the single religious event around which an entire evening was organized.', 'The banya is a place for a more heterogeneous group of body types than a boutique spin class. It’s a place where, if the finance bros get too loud, you simply throw water on the hot rocks and watch them flee to the upstairs whirlpool bath. ', 'The goal of the spa isn’t culinary enlightenment or showing off one’s abs in expensive athleisure. You come to the banya for cleansing, restoring, meditating, and socializing in cheap used swim trunks, which are provided free of charge.', 'My last piece of advice about the banya is to consider the central events in The Irony of Fate, a Soviet screwball comedy from 1975. On New Year’s Eve, a group of friends get so drunk at a Moscow bathhouse that they send the wrong guy on a flight back to Leningrad. The poor chap doesn’t realize his predicament until he wakes up 450 miles away from home, in the bed of a woman no less. A love story ensues and there’s biting commentary on drab Soviet architecture — dude couldn’t tell which city he was in — but really, the point here is that if you drink at the banya, be careful!', 'So while the infused vodkas might be tempting, I’d say a single beer is about the upward limit of alcohol consumption. If the goal of the spa is to beneficially dehydrate, the goal of the cafeteria is to put fluids back in.', 'This applies to solid nourishment as well. Keep things simple, and always order borscht, a soup that’s cloudy and dense with cabbage but with enough tartness to counter the restrained sugars of the beetroot. Also consider the khash, Armenian beef foot and tripe soup, with a float of scallions and pepperoncini. Your lips will stick together from the gelatins.', 'The name of the formal upstairs restaurant, which also services the lower-level banya cafeteria, is Matryoshka, the term for the famous Russian dolls within a doll that decorate the room. For better results, dine in the cafeteria. You seat yourself on a plastic nautical high-back chair — like the ones they rent on European beaches — and you eat food off a backyard-style glass table.', 'You place an order at the counter, take a few runs into the hot rooms — no need to wait at your table like at a traditional restaurant — and in about 10 to 15 minutes, your meal is ready. Perhaps you’ll ask for sweet blini with salty salmon roe; the maritime musk of the red caviar awakens the senses. Feeling just a touch more peckish? Then order pelmeni, Siberian pork dumplings doused in sour cream, or Georgian chicken tabaka, poussin that’s been crisped under a brick till crisp and juicy and slathered with garlic.', 'Then you take a nap, possibly on a soft couch, but more likely at your table. Ten minutes later, you wake up. You take a swing of Poland Spring water. You realize that maybe this water isn’t yours. You drink some more anyway, and you stride back into the sauna, a little more relaxed, and a little more fortified to face the never-ending cold dip pool that is a New York winter.', 'Cost: $50 full-day admission for the bathhouse, though there’s no fee for guests only visiting Matryoshka restaurant.\xa0Platza is an extra $40. Service is not included.', 'Sample dishes: Blini with red caviar, kharcho soup, borscht, Siberian pelmeni, Georgian-style chicken tabaka, lamb shashlik, garlic fried potatoes.', 'Bonus tip: Leave about three hours or more for a proper visit, or longer if you plan on napping. But pace yourself. Go easy on the hot Russian sauna and cold dip pool, especially if you’re a first timer. Consider wearing a wool hat ($20 at the gift shop) to protect your head from the heat.

31,"['Inventive, pan-regional cooking heralds a new kind of New York Chinese restaurant on the Upper West Side', 'In the final decades of the 20th century, the Upper West Side became a hotbed of Sichuan cuisine. Chains like Empire Szechuan concentrated there, and one of our earliest Sichuan chefs, Wei Kai Chang, established himself at a restaurant simply called Szechuan. So it’s not too much of a stretch that this neighborhood flourishes again as a bastion of regional Chinese cooking. Part of the reason is the proximity of Columbia University, where Asia-born students and faculty crave restaurants that provide a better taste of back home.', 'The latest newcomer, Atlas Kitchen — whose website boasts “located next to Columbia University” — indeed excels at not just one regional style of Chinese cooking, but several. Pack your bags, because we’re going on a culinary tour of China.', 'Chef Kaiyuan Li is a Hunan native and a 20-year veteran of the New York dining scene, previously working at Hunan Manor. Dishes from that province — where sour and spicy flavors and dried, smoked, and pickled ingredients are prized — have a major presence on the menu. Sichuan food is also a frequent menu inspiration at Atlas Kitchen, with some dishes miraculously transformed.', 'Chef Kaiyuan Li and owners Haocheng Sun and Dong Chen (left to right)', 'That old chestnut Chongqing chicken — you know, the ubiquitous heap of dried red chiles and bony chicken morsels — is here improved with garlic slices, extra oil, a crispness to the chicken tidbits, and tiny twists of dough called ma hwa, which are being seen in northern Chinese restaurants in Flushing. And Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Chinese-American food also appears. But Li does not always stick to tradition here, often innovating on classics of the genre.', 'Situated near the corner of 109th Street and Broadway, the restaurant has a boxy modern premises, with murals wrapping around two walls created by famed artist Qiu Anxiong, who was born in Chengdu. The mural is a continuation of his video animation series “New Classics of Mountains and Seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by. The art creates a calmness in the restaurant, which mounts a menu that flies to the four corners of China for its inspiration. ', 'Many say that Hunan food is hotter than Sichuan, but that’s not the case at Atlas Kitchen, though many dishes are righteously spicy. The red chiles printed in the margins of the menu are a relatively good indicator.', 'Front and center is one of the cuisine’s preeminent offerings, a humongous steamed fish head ($30.95) finished with red-hot oil, heaped with scallions and chopped chiles. The specimen is a buffalo carp, and more of the collar than usual is generously included, so diners don’t have to poke at the eyes and pull swatches of skin away from the cheeks to reveal some of the sweetest reservoirs of flesh. Every morsel is delicious, and if your table is like mine, all that will be left is a heap of bones.', 'But the best Hunanese dish on the menu may be braised chicken wings, feet, and gizzards in vinegar sauce ($24.95), which rates two chiles on a menu that doesn’t confer three. It arrives in a wash of tart yellowish broth made of preserved green pepper, with, on the occasion I tried it, a chicken talon sticking out of the broth and pointing accusatorially. The chicken parts are accompanied by various vegetables. What a lovely sight! Other don’t-miss Hunan dishes include beef jerky, dry as driftwood yet spectacular in its addictive properties, and spicy dried tofu ($10.95), a pepper-flecked barrage of compressed tofu triangles that achieve the texture of Twizzlers, served room temp.', 'Some of the options are Li’s own creations, such as a plate of miniature tomatoes and blueberries dotted with dried sour plums, whose sharp, salty flavor provides a contrast to the fresher, sweeter components. His dish called beef flank in dry wok — cooked using a German stewing technique, based on his experience in that country —  is anything but dry. The small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus. One invention that doesn’t work is braised fish with perilla ($28.95). The leaves, which belong to the same family as Japanese shiso, have been cooked to flavorlessness without adding much to the fish.', 'On the Sichuan side of the menu, successes include pig trotters with the meat removed from the bone and finely diced, then stir-fried with fresh green chiles. Their wonderful gluey quality remains. Among dishes from Shanghai and vicinity is “minced beef with cilantro and egg white soup,” which represents the restaurant’s take on West Lake beef soup. The Shanghai soup dumplings are good here, too, thin-skinned and bulging with broth, though smaller than average ($10.95 with crab, $8.95 without).', 'One of my favorite things on the menu is a fancified version of a classic Chinese egg custard: Steamed eggs with seafood ($15.95) treats a soft omelet as a seabed below an ocean of reddish, soy-based sauce in which sea creatures lurk, including squid, shrimp, white fish, and fake-crab surimi. Eat it by scooping up egg, sauce, and sea denizen from the bottom with the big spoon, then plop it on your plate on a hillock of rice.', 'On the other hand, you might want to avoid ordering rice entirely, since the menu includes two great forms of fried rice. The one called yan chow is a zippy take on a southern Chinese classic, rife with eggs and Spam. A Hunan fried rice is also available, shot with long beans, char siu, and fresh red bird chiles. One of the most intriguing regional dishes comes from Dongbei in the far northeast, where sweet and sour was supposedly invented. Fried pork in scoop ($16.95) is a ball of pork fried with a very thick and unabashedly sweet crust. While perhaps reviling its sweetness, you’ll adore every bite.', 'Atlas Kitchen heralds a new type of Chinese restaurant in the city, one with a seasoned chef willing to take risks, while selecting favorite dishes from all over China. Heck, there’s even a page called American Style, which includes such classics as beef with broccoli and kung pao chicken. It serves to restore Chinese-American food to its rightful honored place among Chinese cuisines.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one appetizer, two main dishes, fried rice, a shared dessert, and pot of tea, including tax but not tip, $95.', 'Sample Dishes: Potherb mustard bowl, steamed fish head, Hunan fried rice, fried pork in scoop.', 'What to Drink: This place is not fooling around when it comes to tea, and distinguished tea is not cheap. Small pots of tea served in ornate pots average $10, but in the Chinese tradition, water is added continuously to the pot, so the tea becomes weaker as the meal progresses.', 'Bonus Tip: Put together as large a table of diners as you can, because choosing among the many beguiling dishes will be less difficult. In addition, large parties are allowed to sit in the raised rear room, which provides views of the entire restaurant.', '']"
32,"['The tiny Cobble Hill restaurant brings inventive cooking to an eclectic ocean haul', 'Before you scoff at the price of a gooseneck barnacle — the worm-shaped creature can fetch $100 per pound — understand that there is no such thing as a farm-raised species. The crustacean thrives on wave-battered rocks and cliffs. Those who collect them, on the Iberian or Pacific Coasts, are equal parts fishers, foragers, and climbers. Their toolsets include wetsuits, harnesses, clamps, and when necessary, ropes for rappelling. To harvest a barnacle means to risk death. But to consume one, a possibility at the spectacular Saint Julivert Fisherie in Brooklyn, means to sample one of the world’s great delicacies. ', 'Alex Raij and Eder Montero are among a handful of New York chefs to serve the percebe, as it’s known in Spanish. The stubby, ugly creatures serve as a stark visual contrast to the crab-stuffed avocados and other attractive small plates in which Saint Julivert specializes. The calcified head of a gooseneck evokes a malformed clam, while the brown thorax recalls a petrified lizard phallus. They are boiled in salt water and served as is. No sauce, no lemon. A waiter advises twisting off the leathery body, revealing a single longitudinal muscle. Sometimes that muscle is pink. Sometimes it’s tan or black. In neither case does it appear edible or delicious. ', 'Rest assured, it is both. The texture mimics that of a razor clam. And the flavor might suggest a Nantucket Bay scallop in its sweet wintry prime. Or it might, depending on the barnacle, convey its sugars in a more restrained fashion, like those of a Maine lobster. Still others recall the briny wallop of a crashing wave pulling you under. Each bite is unique. What is inevitable, however, is that three minutes into eating, your hands will turn sticky with shellfish juice. ', 'Such a pristine expression of the sea doesn’t come cheap; Saint Julivert asks $30 for about 20 thumb-sized goosenecks. But if a dozen oysters can run $50 elsewhere, or if a tin of caviar can command $100 anywhere in the city, it’s hard not to think of this rare barnacle for what it truly is: a value. And with this dish, it’s hard not to think of Saint Julivert, a single room of a restaurant on a quiet Cobble Hill street, as one of the city’s best places to eat fish.', 'New York has many new seafood spots; few of them are accessible or interesting. Contemporary operators have largely used the oceans of planet Earth, the source of so much biodiversity and (occasionally) sustainable bounty, to fuel a spate of blandly expensive restaurants. These venues primarily exist within a tight band of European or Japanese traditions; one thinks of the burgeoning sushi spots built for an army of finance and tech workers. Or consider the (admittedly more global) Pool with its $200-per-person dinner tabs. Or how about the new Milos opening in Hudson Yards? The website for that Greek palace offers Mediterranean yacht rentals.', 'A touch of skepticism about Saint Julivert, in other words, is hard to avoid. And at first glance, nothing about the restaurant suggests it’s a boundary-pushing establishment. It sits amid a row of $5 million brownstones. Inside, patrons in cable-knit sweaters and flannel vests sip at beet-juice cocktails. The whole tableau feels very J.Crew, very suburban upper middle class, very basic.', 'A perusal of the menu, however, reveals that any skepticism is misplaced. Saint Julivert succeeds more than any other venue in channeling the world’s oceans into a distinctly New York expression of maritime internationalism. The chile-flecked bill of fare boasts influences from Peru, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Portugal, Mexico, and China. Almost every dish is under $20. ', 'And just about every trope of modern oceanic eating is absent. Gone is the four-bite, $30 plate of deep-sea snapper sashimi. Banished is the altitudinous shellfish tower, gleaming with chipped ice and chilled clams. And there is most certainly no caviar service.', 'There aren’t even oysters on the half shell. Instead, the kitchen fries the bivalves tempura style and stuffs them inside a beef tenderloin sandwich — a meaty, mineral surf-and-turf po’ boy. The chefs also place oysters, plumped under the broiler, atop layers of pig ear and kombu doused in crimson chile oil. The net effect is a kaleidoscopic terrine of swine and sea, with all squishy, umami-rich proteins yielding to a lingering pepper burn. ', 'Few other ambitious seafood spots — the thrilling Le Sia notwithstanding — deploy the pain and tingle of heat with such confidence. Tiny dried prawns, and a squeeze of lime, add a bit of funky zip to ramekin of spicy roasted peanuts. And posole warms the palate with arbol and guajillo chiles; barely cooked-through shrimp sit on top of the hominy soup, offering relief in the form of creamy sweetness.  ', 'Raij and Montero, for the most part, have never really operated by the standard restaurant-empire playbook. They rose to fame at El Quinto Pino, hawking sea-urchin sandwiches with Korean mustard oil; at Txikito, selling some of the city’s most exhilarating renditions of Basque fare; and at La Vara, which uses food to tell the story of Spain’s historic Sephardic and Moorish traditions. ', 'Then, next door to La Vara, they opened up an all-day cafe called Tekoa that didn’t exactly bring in the crowds. It closed this year and became Saint Julivert in September, and it’s been packed ever since. ', 'Anyone who’s ever waited two hours for walk-in seats at La Vara can take comfort in the fact that things move quicker here, with a long steel bar and a chef’s counter reserved for those without advance bookings. Backless stools cut down on lingering.', 'Servers recommend six dishes for two tops or nine for parties of three. Take their advice; most of the cold plates are modestly portioned. ', 'Scallop tacos — three for $13 — are one- or two-bite affairs. Raij and Montero slick the shellfish with salsa macha, garnish it with pickled red onion, and lay it atop a shiso leaf. The resulting wrap expresses the component flavors and textures — acid, anise, grassy crispness, marshmallow softness, and complex nuttiness — with laser-like precision. Fluke ceviche also gets the job done, letting the neutral flatfish act as a conduit for a wallop of lime, onion, and cilantro. And mussels en conserva juxtapose the concentrated punch of bivalve brine against the tang of pickled carrots and the perfume of fresh mint. ', 'Really, order anything except for the turmeric-laced tuna bake, a mess of musky fish and bland tomato sauce. Skate is the staple safe order, a well-executed slab of sherry-sauced wing. ', 'The true gem of the hot dishes is the jerk kanpachi collar, a bony, fatty, pick-apart-with-your-hands side of yellowtail. Raij and Montero blacken the exterior with a copious blend of thyme, chiles, and allspice, dampening the fish’s rampant oils with nuclear-powered aromas. It might not pack the intoxicating hardwood smoke of proper jerk, but the Jamaican spices come through unabated. Consider pairing the collar with sorullitos, Puerto Rican corn fritters shaped like cigars; they function as a silky, starchy antidote to the heady fish.', 'Desserts don’t necessarily wow at the same level; skip a stiff panna cotta in favor of Cuban bread pudding with mezcal ice cream — a deconstructed riff of sorts on baba au rhum. But a near-perfect meal at Saint Julivert doesn’t require refined sugars. The savory fare already does enough to sate, to inspire, to disrupt high-end seafood’s spendy stranglehold on the city.', 'Cost: Most dishes are under $20; about three savory plates per person make a meal. Barnacles run $30. Expect to spend about $100 per person after drink, tax, and tip. ', 'Sample dishes: Spicy peanuts with dried shrimp and lime, whipped mackerel with piri piri oil, boiled gooseneck barnacles, pig-ear terrine with broiled oysters, raw scallops with shiso and salsa macha, posole with shrimp and avocado, skate with sherry and dry chile, jerk kanpachi collar.', 'Bonus tip:  Virtually all seats, whether reserved or for walk-ins, are backless stools. Also consider calling ahead if you plan on dining as a walk-in to gauge the wait, though be warned that phone calls are not always answered. About one-third to half of the seats are reserved for walk-ins on any given night.']"
33,"['I didn’t go to the University of California at Berkeley—or Cal, as native Northern Californians call it—and therefore I never spent my formative college years sucking down beers at Henry’s, the 90-year-old hotel pub and restaurant on Durant Avenue. I did that across the country at an 85-year-old establishment called the Old Stone Jug. Same-same, except the Jug didn’t serve food. I’ve always felt like, at a college bar, really, why bother?', 'Henry’s does, though; it always has, in various uninspired forms, from “Hangover Specials” to house-made burgers to ahi tuna paninis. That said, according to a friend of mine who went to Cal and drunk-met her now-husband there 20 years ago at 2 a.m., “people never actually ate there.”', 'They tailgated there; they watched the big game there. Since it was considered the slightest step up from other college dives, they actually took their parents there. Back in 1990, dozens of diners were even held hostage there. And, always, people flirted there. “To me, it was where older men went to meet younger women, and younger women went to meet older men,” as one 2002 alum so eloquently phrased it to me. ', 'But now, enter the latest incarnation of Henry’s from culinary cult favorite Chris Kronner, of Oakland’s Kronnerburger fame. He’s brought in buns and bread from Tartine Bakery and a pedigreed team that includes general manager Howie Correa, from Chez Panisse, of all places. It’s perhaps the only college-town pub in America attempting to lure students with oil-cured fennel salads and coal-roasted lamb neck. Leave it to Berkeley. ', 'One hazard of running a restaurant in a university neighborhood, however? Summer. On an early evening in late May, the dining room was half empty, so I couldn’t tell if students were digging it. But as soon as I stepped inside, I certainly was. ', 'Inside the old Durant Hotel, recently remodeled and hip-ified by the Graduate Hotel chain, Henry’s still felt historical, almost hallowed. As a San Franciscan who’s spent much of the last year eating in shiny new spots, I appreciate its old bones.The day’s last light streams in at dusk; the honey-hued, wood-paneled space soars with 22-foot ceilings; top-shelf whiskeys line the classic bar, and the walls are lined with booths. Deep, leather, olive-colored booths roomy enough for a group, but still cozy for two. Across the way during one visit was a family of five, all of them sporting Cal sweatshirts. College! I felt nostalgic. ', 'My friend and I cuddled in and surveyed the menu: chicken wings, burgers, and fries, but then halibut tartare, Parisian gnocchi, and “Sugar Snap Peas and Brooks Cherries with frisee.” It was like senior year: still in school, but insisting upon sophistication. ', 'I had trouble deciding what to order. Because this was Kronner, I really wanted a burger. But I thought maybe I should take the more challenging route and go for the lamb neck with mint and spring vegetables.', 'The servers were of no help: surly, terse, emanating a kind of annoyed-to-be-here energy. “Can you tell me a bit about the oil-cured fennel?” I asked. ', '“It’s cured fennel,” one employee replied.', 'We wondered — aloud, and admittedly, annoyingly — if it would be too much bread (even Tartine bread) to get the marinated feta with za’atar and grilled country bread and the ’nduja toast with ricotta and pickles. “It’s a personal choice,” non-advised another server. ', 'When we inquired about a couple other items, she caved. “Okay, I don’t really know. I haven’t had anything here.” She paused. “I’m studying family medicine.” (Great. But we’d also love your educated opinion on the $34 New York Strip.) ', 'If Henry’s was just your average college bar, no problem — but Henry’s is aspiring to be more. She may not have gotten that memo.

When he left in 2012 to launch a burger pop-up at Bruno’s, his fans followed. Three years later, Kronnerburger opened in Oakland to crazy lines and rabid reviews.

He’s supported by his former executive chef at Kronnerburger, Justin Hoffman, and Jeffrey Hayden, whom he recruited from Del Popolo.', 'Their aim is to give the Cal community, greater Berkeley, and hotel guests food and drink befitting both an iconic institution and a true Northern California neighborhood restaurant. ', 'It’s a lofty goal and a far cry from operating a burger place, even a Kronnerburger place. As much as I love the idea of elevating off-campus cuisine, Henry’s seems to be struggling in its first semester. ', 'The issues are clearest in the service department. Undoubtedly, the cards are stacked against them. Securing experienced restaurant staff is difficult everywhere in the Bay Area these days, but hiring in Berkeley is especially tricky, due to its seasonality as a university town, less big-city bustle, and, maybe most importantly, because the minimum wage is almost two bucks higher across the Bay Bridge. (At least for now. San Francisco’s $14 minimum wage will spike to $15 in July, and in October, Berkeley’s will too.)', 'It’d be easier to give Henry’s unpolished service a pass if the food was an A. But I found it, on the whole, average; I wished it weren’t trying so hard to be mature.', 'For instance, the “snacks” section of the menu sounds refined, but wasn’t. A pile of squishy fish cubes doused in creme fraiche and adorned, for some reason, with slices of kiwi may be called local halibut tartare, but in texture and taste, it’s more reminiscent of a chunky, slightly fishy yogurt. Accompanied by feathery wisps of Wasa-like crackers that cracked with every scoop, it’s a fail. And that “Sugar Snap Peas and Brooks Cherries with frisee” is false advertising. Per the wording, I was expecting a bounty of crisp peas and sweet cherries sidelined by a handful of frisee. Instead, I got an unruly tangle in an insipid pepita dressing, hiding a few mushy peas and halved flavorless fruit.', 'As for the entrees, I went for the lamb neck on one visit. It was a massive, bone-in hunk, smoked, then slow-roasted, and teetering over a mound of peppery-sweet labneh in an amorphous puddle of garlic-chile sauce. It came with a butter knife. After sawing without success, I requested something sharper. The meat was oily, more tough than tender, and shrouded in slices of sauteed snap peas and shredded carrots that looked like they were straight out of a Dole bag. Not exactly the spritely “spring vegetables” I’d envisioned. (I was later told the lamb neck is no longer on the menu, perhaps for good reason.)', 'The Parisian gnocchi had the fresh English peas I’d been hoping for, but the gnocchi — in a Meyer lemon-miso vinaigrette — tasted like underseasoned cotton balls.', ' Finally, on my third visit, I ordered what I should have had on my first.', ' “Do people always ask you, ‘What’s a CheeseBoy?’” we asked our server, after asking “What’s a CheeseBoy?” ourselves.

It comes swathed with Henry’s “special” Thousand Island-esque sauce, American cheese, and tomato jam. Then there’s the Henry’s burger, which is basically the same thing, sans tomato jam — plus, you can customize it with cheddar or blue cheese for an extra two bucks, or with bone marrow for an extra $5. Both burgers come on a sweet-potato bun from Tartine Bakery. And neither of Kronner’s burgers at Henry’s are the same as his Kronnerburger burgers.', 'But both burgers are the best things at Henry’s. Well, other than the chicken wings, which are spicy and crackling-crisp and come with a fermented Fresno chile sauce so good we ditched the vegan French onion dip that our plate of house-made potato chips came with. Each 4-ounce patty comes squashed with pickles and its respective accoutrements on a bouncy, soft bun. Oh, the tomato jam could be sweeter, and Henry’s special sauce isn’t all that special. But they are burgers both a wide-eyed freshman and a discerning professor would love.', 'I hope that with a little more effort, Kronner and his team will rise to the occasion and meet their potential. But ultimately, despite the restaurant’s adult ambitions — and even under Kronner’s instruction — the new-and-improved Henry’s remains what college pubs most everywhere are: sophomoric.

The Old Fashioned is also good. \xa0Note that James Beard-nominated beverage consultant Julian Cox designed the bar program (and is doing Tartine Manufactory’s next).

Like take-out dim sum and quiet-night Thai, gloppy Mexican and greasy burgers — and long, blanket-wrapped waits for one of seven tables at Pizzetta 211.', 'But now, next door, there’s Pearl: a refined, window-walled corner restaurant open until the oh-so-late hour of 10 p.m. And what it’s offering is very different out here: cocktails mixed with ingredients like pink peppercorn and grapefruit, a wood-fired oven, and — for better or worse — reservations. Given Pearl’s instant popularity, it’s wise to make one if you can. All that was left each time I tried were 5 p.m. or 9 p.m. slots. ', 'When I rolled out of the restaurant after the feast that was my first visit, I realized that 9 p.m. on a school night was too late. And Pearl, I promise, is a feast. One that, like Thanksgiving, is better enjoyed earlier in the evening rather than just before bed. Not to mention, at the later hour the staff is deep into its close-out duties — folding stacks of napkins, funneling liquids into plastic vats — before it’s time for dessert. After all, as Hayes Valley-hip as Pearl may feel, this is still the avenues.', 'In late May, Jack Murphy, of Pizzetta 211’s treasured 20-year-old closet of thin-crust pizza, opened an ambitious, employee-owned, sister restaurant with a whopping 58 seats. Co-chefs Mel Lopez and Joyce Conway are at the helm. Early write-ups have called Pearl “seafood-centric” — and with oysters and gulf prawns and ample anchovies, it’s apt — but it also has handmade pastas and hefty pork chops and platters of beef big enough to feed the Brady Bunch.', 'On the evening we took the 5 p.m. reservation, I arrived a half-hour late, enraged by San Francisco traffic and the latest news on NPR. My friends, who walked no more than five, ten minutes from their respective homes to get here, were hunkered into a semi-circular, camel-colored, corner booth, beaming and sipping cocktails, with a dozen oysters on the way. “We’ve been wanting a place like this!” they exclaimed, like Pearl’s self-appointed cheering squad. “We’re so happy it’s here!”', 'Our server sets down my new favorite martini: “The Pearl Martini,” a briny-smooth Oakland-distilled “sea gin” with a splash of Italian vermouth, garnished with spindly pickled sea bean. A palette of mild Marin miyagi oysters follows, each splashed with horseradish and a fiery fermented hot sauce. Suddenly, I’m happy too. ', 'It’s hard not to be at Pearl, really: a cheery-white and light-filled place, with a genuinely smiley staff. Here, food is cooked with something many new San Francisco restaurants — at the mercy of big investor backing and bottom lines — seem unable to afford lately: heart. ', 'Without the help of outside investors, the owners — Murphy, the chefs, and a half-dozen other Pizzetta alums — transformed a former laundromat into a date-night-worthy destination. It’s the kind of low-key, lively, stylish spot that could make less-lively, less-stylish neighbors feel like they’ve trekked across town.', 'With its wainscotting and French stripe napkins, wraparound bar and second-floor balcony, Pearl’s vibe is like Hamptons beach house meets New Orleans meets...mid-Richmond. Unfortunately, that balcony is unabashedly used for storage as opposed to French Quarter-esque revelling or additional seating.', 'Unlike the city’s more happening neighborhoods, where the rowdy twenty-something crowd reigns, at Pearl, millennials are the minority. The place is packed with a rare multigenerational mix: gray-haired men in sneakers and sixty-something women in oversized sweaters settle into booths next to middle-aged mom friends and food-industry families. Everyone is dressed for a night out in the avenues, which means: comfortably. ', 'The three-meals-a-day menu could be described as such, too: comfort food, but fit for 2018. It begins with wood-fired bagels and banana bread, morphs into toasted farro bowls and a nourishing berbere-spiced carrot soup, and ends with a quivering lemon verbena panna cotta. ', 'Instead of mac-n-cheese, there is handkerchief pasta in a white Bolognese that erases any remaining angst of my day. A subtle creamy sauce with crumbled milk-braised pork and veal dress its silky, delicate folds. Thin peels of Grana Padano cheese, flecks of parsley, and a healthy grind of black pepper blanket it all. It’s hearty, but not heavy like a traditional Bolognese — and so good I think I might’ve said so repeatedly out loud several times, until our shared plate was scraped clean.', 'Same with the spaghetti: a slick, chewy tangle with spicy anchovies and smashed garlic, the crunch of chili-spiced breadcrumbs, and a confit of cherry tomatoes so sweet and juicy they puncture upon the slightest contact. A Sun Gold actually squirted across the table and onto my friend’s sweater, as if to make its mark: proof of a memorable meal.', 'The only problem with my pasta was that I wanted to savor the last of it. Instead it was a race to the finish due to the untimely arrival of our entrees. I liked the wood-fired pork chop with fried fingerling potatoes and sticky-sweet apricot cherry mostarda well enough; the chicken roulade with its crackling skin, too. Still, I couldn’t help but resent them both for taking my fork away from my most perfect pastas too soon. It was an expediting issue that occurred on two separate visits.', 'Not every dish evokes an “oh-my-god-this-is-so-good” response. Several spur more of an unimpressed meh. The chili-spiked ricotta, baked in the wood oven with artichokes, is more chalky than creamy and lacks the kick it promises. Likewise, the roasted cauliflower tasted more rubbery than roasted. Lukewarm, wallowing in a muddy puddle of black tahini hummus, it’s scattered with almonds and golden raisins and an earthy green chermoula. The dish made me wish they’d just charred the cauliflower — as restaurants are wont to do these days — and let it be. ', 'But Pearl’s spin on a Caesar salad — a heap of chopped romaine and chicories shrouded with shaved Parmesan and shreds of crisped prosciutto, is a pleasurable deviation from the standard.', 'Pearl, too, is a welcome departure from what’s become the new normal. That is to say: It’s neither five-course tasting menu nor fast-casual, but a happy, homey place that offers something arguably better than both in these stressful, politically-charged times: a family supper. ', 'It’s a complete, occasionally-changing, exceptionally balanced meal consisting of a meat, vegetable, and side dish that, according to the menu, “serves two-to-three people.” If you order anything else, though — and you will want to — consider it serving closer to four to six.', 'On one night, family supper is a Tomahawk chop. Thick, tender slices of charred, purple-hued beef fan across a platter with sweet, blistered Cipollini onion bulbs, fat asparagus spears, buttery bearnaise, and a boat of deliciously grainy, chili-dusted, cheesy polenta I could’ve sailed away on. At $120, it’s not the most affordable way to feed a family (or a friend-family), but it’s a revitalizing way. ', 'Some neighborhood restaurants reflect their neighbors to a tee and serve them what they want. The best, though, like Pearl, give them what they didn’t even realize they needed: a warm, soothing space, sheltered from the Richmond’s fog, to drink sea gin martinis and slurp oysters and discuss the day, the world, and local issues, big and small.', 'Like the one brought up by a woman we met on our apres-supper walk around the block to work off that chop. She was outside, weeding her front yard. “Oh, I wanted to try that place,” she said, scrunching her face. “But I’m against the notion of having to make a dinner reservation at a restaurant in my own neighborhood.”', 'I get it, I nodded. Then I thought back to my recent midday visit. My bready tombo tuna salad sandwich wasn’t worth the special trip out to 23rd Avenue. And daytime’s quick counter service isn’t half as satisfying as Pearl’s sit-down supper. But if I lived down the street, it would be. Good news, I told her: There’s always lunch. ', '', 'What it costs: Before tax and tip it’s around $150 for a couple of everything: starters, pastas, entrees, and cocktails.', 'What to drink: The Pearl Martini is a must. At $12 a piece, the cocktails are as reasonably priced as the wines by the glass ($10 to $12).', 'What to eat: Oysters, berbere-spiced carrot soup, chicory Caesar, handkerchief white Bolognese, spaghetti with spicy anchovies, family supper, and the lemon verbena panna cotta.', 'Bonus: There’s talk of adding outside sidewalk seating. Fog be damned.', '']"
35,"['The exclusive Williamsburg restaurant is a rare miss by chef Missy Robbins\xa0', '“Even Jennifer Lawrence had to wait for a table at Brooklyn hotspot Lilia,” a New York Post headline read this spring. One can relate. A new rite of passage for New York gourmands is approaching the host at the Williamsburg destination and getting quoted a wait time that seems mathematically impossible. Those who arrive just before 5 p.m. will encounter a line that stretches down the block. And those who check for online reservations will think they’ve happened upon the ticketing website for Elton John’s goodbye tour — nothing available. ', 'The reason for such insanity is the cooking of Missy Robbins, a singular commodity in a city where Italian food is nothing less than ubiquitous. No one else seems to lace their garlic bread with speckles of orange bottarga, or dust their mafaldini with coarse grinds of pink peppercorns. When Pete Wells came to review Lilia in 2016, he awarded three stars and issued a specific bit of praise: ”Pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness,” the NYT critic wrote. Demand quickly outstripped supply. ', 'A sequel was all but inevitable. And so in September Robbins opened a second spot, Misi, in the heart of the $3 billion Domino Sugar redevelopment. Here the focus would be more streamlined. While the menu at Lilia spans multiple categories, Misi’s only starters are vegetables. The only desserts are gelati. And the only mains — beefy specials notwithstanding — are pastas, all made in a 325-square-foot, temperature- and humidity-controlled room. ', 'Feel like swinging by? As I write this, the next available reservation is at 11:00 p.m. On a Monday. One month from today. For counter seating. Walk-ins who show up late might sit down immediately, while those who swing by at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday can wait 90 minutes or longer for bar seats. It’s all enough to make one assume that Robbins has again given New York one of its best new Italian restaurants. If only that were the case.', 'Misi, at the very least, is a scene. Here’s Bobby Flay on a date. There’s Action Bronson, sporting his signature beard. Golden helium balloons float about in the private room next door. Four hosts greet patrons behind a low-rise table; it recalls the check-in counter at a chic charity event. The open kitchen shines just brightly enough to flatter patrons at the chef’s counter. The bartenders pour frothy bellinis that diners suck down in seconds. The servers whisk over uneven pastas. The prime window seats overlook the Williamsburg Bridge in all its nocturnal... wait, there’s an issue with the pastas?', 'There is. The noodles range from serviceable — like a forgettable pappardelle with chickpeas — to nearly disastrous — an oppressively saline bowl of fish sauce-laced linguine. In fact, the pasta problems are distinct enough that they can stop a bona fide Robbins aficionado mid-sentence. ', 'A few weeks ago my companion was monologuing about the genius of the chef and her roasted romanesco. Robbins showers the toothsome florets with an electric blend of lemon juice, olive oil, and coriander, imparting the stubby brassica with a vibrancy that’s at once electric, luscious, and fragrant. Then I watched my friend turn silent as he tried the carpaccio-like corzetti. Handsome rounds of pasta sat underneath an insipid tomato sauce and a canopy of fresh basil; the herb obliterated whatever nuance there might’ve been in the first place.', 'Clockwise left: Spinach ricotta tortelli, chef Missy Robbins, the bar and dining room at Misi', 'This is not the Missy Robbins we know, the mind behind one of the pastas of the decade: Lilia’s agnolotti with sheep’s milk ricotta. She uses saffron-infused honey — a bit of sugar and perfume — to counteract the tartness and funk of the cheese. The interplay of flavors is almost scientific in its balance, and yet the pairing is as simple as a composed cheese plate. ', 'Or consider her rigatoni al diavola, also at Lilia. Spicy tomato sauce is a common enough preparation, but it somehow tastes cleaner and more alive under Robbins’s control. The San Marzanos are brighter and more acidic than elsewhere, while the Calabrian chiles exude a warming spiciness. ', 'It’s from these two dishes that one derives a certain Tao of Robbins. The chef tweaks classic preparations in such a way that they taste fresh and revelatory. And she concocts gently creative pastas that somehow feel intuitive and seamless within the multitudinous traditions of Italian cooking. She’s neither an avowed regionalist, like the devoutly Tuscan Rita Sodi, nor a more freeform experimentalist, like the chefs at Don Angie. At her best, Robbins is a pasta pragmatist, drawing on countless styles and influences to make absolutely inimitable noodles. ', 'At Misi, by contrast, the only consistently impressive thing about the pastas is their al dente firmness.', 'Robbins can do better. She concocts a briny (if thin) clam broth and pairs it with a pile of gently mealy malloreddus, a small Sardinian gnocchi. The golden liquid doesn’t permeate the bland pasta, nor does the dish bring any of its promised saffron aroma. Rigatoni, boasting a tomato sauce with 30 cloves of garlic, assaults the palate with salt and cheese. Strangozzi, long, thick noodles, get tossed with a one-note pork ragu; the dish begs for a rounder flavor (and maybe just a touch of acid). And linguine with anchovy and colatura — an Italian fish sauce — packs a level of salt that gives the brain a very distinct message: Stop eating. Which we did.', 'And then there were the white truffles. The seasonal fungi, at their best, exhibit a pungent fragrance that lingers in the air on the palate for minutes. Here, they’re shaved over an otherwise fine fettuccine with Parmesan and buffalo butter. But the aroma is short and flat, like that of a Designer Imposter cologne instead of the real thing. At $91, it could put a novice off this luxury forever.', 'The only pasta that shows any real sign of classic Robbins brilliance are the occhi, little ravioli that the cooks stuff with sheep’s milk ricotta and drench in butter, bottarga, and lemon zest. Not a single element falls out of balance; the warm dairy heats up the roe, releasing its perfume, while the aromatic citrus and puckery cheese keep the maritime tang in check. ', 'The smart strategy at Misi is to order the occhi and stock up on another forte of Robbins: vegetables. Cooks roast eggplants until they exhibit the texture of pudding and drizzle the insides with crimson Calabrian chile oil. You scoop out the smoky, spicy, fleshy insides with a spoon and eat this happy dish like a child devouring ice cream. The kitchen takes grilled bread the thickness of Texas Toast and pipes whipped ricotta on top. The cheese shimmers like marshmallow fluff. Diners finish plating the crostini themselves, placing blistered and vinegared peppers on top. The result is pure cream, char, and crunch. ', 'If a porterhouse for two is offered, order it ($110). The meat veers away from the prevailing New York style of steak, an ode to aging and blue cheese funk. Robbins instead opts for a more cheffed-up preparation, crusting the exterior in fennel pollen, charring it rare, and drizzling enough lemon juice over the cut to qualify it as a modern, high-acid dish. The flavors are simple and pure: concentrated beefiness followed by the mellow sweetness of singed anise.', 'Steak, of course, calls for ice cream. Mint gelato manages to exhibit the assertive grassiness of the herb without any of the menthol-like sting. Toasted almond, as tan as khakis, pushes the envelope on what a frozen dessert is; it mirrors the texture and richness of finely ground nut butter. And fior di latte does what that flavor does best: expresses the taste of fresh milk as cleanly as mozzarella.', 'In this shiny slice of Williamsburg, the gelati are a fine way to end what’s, unexpectedly, a perfect steakhouse meal of sides, martinis, wine, and, if it’s available, that porterhouse. But as a pasta spot that people wait a month to get into for an 11 p.m. reservation, it needs work. Robbins, who helped make regulars out of the Obamas during her days at Spiaggia in Chicago, is unquestionably one of the country’s great Italian chefs. But for now, Misi is just another exclusive restaurant in another exorbitant neighborhood.', 'Cost: Vegetable starters under $20; pastas under $30; steak for two at $110 (as a special). Gelati are $8 apiece. Expect to spend about $100 per person or more.', 'Sample dishes: Ricotta toast with marinated peppers; eggplant with Calabrian chile oil; roasted romanesco; fettuccine with Parmesan and buffalo butter; occhi with bottarga and lemon zest; rigatoni with 30-clove ragu; malloreddus with clams, sea beans, and saffron; porterhouse for two, assorted gelati.', 'Bonus tip: Sometimes walk-ins are accommodated immediately. Sometimes the wait can stretch past 90 minutes. And sometimes the hosts stop taking names by 8:30 p.m. No one picks up the phone to chat about wait times; an answering machine advises to email for immediate assistance. An email to that address was not returned during a recent dinner service.']"
36,"['The airy, plant-strewn restaurant from an Isa alum has excitement ingrained in the menu', 'We’re already familiar with the traditional Greek method of preparing octopus, by whacking it against a rock to tenderize it before slowly simmering, resulting in gluey and chewy cephalopod. But Pheasant has found another way. Tentacles are braised for up to two hours and pan-roasted in olive oil, then deposited in a slurry of spicy liquid salami and the concentrated yogurt called labneh, providing a funky and sour contrast to the blandness of the creature, which develops a texture like red licorice laces. The effect of this $16 dish is to make octopus lovers very happy.', 'Pheasant, opened last November, is a bistro located in an obscure corner of Williamsburg, on Graham Avenue beneath the roar of the BQE. This area remained an immigrant southern Italian neighborhood for the longest time; indeed the premises of the restaurant was formerly Graham Avenue Meats and Deli, a shop with a devoted following for its chicken cutlet hero.', 'Now, no trace of the deli remains in the airy and informal dining room, the walls suspending mirrors and perforated fixtures that shoot out narrow beams of light, with pottery and potted plants strewn here and there. A white, L-shaped bar dominates the space and makes it a very friendly place to eat. The restaurant is descended from a catering company called Little Pheasant, run by Cat Alexander along with her husband and chef Vincent Fraissange, who was formerly executive chef at Taavo Somer’s experimental Williamsburg restaurant Isa.', 'Pheasant’s 16-item menu is one of those that doesn’t really distinguish between apps and mains, and some of the former can function as light meals, especially if you’re not too hungry. The bill of fare incorporates diverse and sometimes wild Mediterranean elements into such bistro commonplaces as hanger steak, seasonal vegetables, roast chicken, a twisted burger, quirky salads, and “day boat” halibut.', 'Take a favorite seasonal vegetable — thick-stalked asparagus — perfect in its freshness and snap. You almost wouldn’t recognize it at Pheasant. The rods have been lightly battered like tempura, flash fried so no limpness results, then scattered on the plate with puffy buttons of potato mousse and cooling slices of ham. Ham? Yes, and not prosciutto, either, but good old American smoked ham like your mom or dad might have put in your sandwich if you grew up in the Midwest. The dish ($11) is summery dining perfection, and might be the best thing on the menu.', 'Is that menu overly creative? Not for me. I enjoyed the Fez salad; it douses greens and vegetables with a carrot-cumin vinaigrette. I also loved a red endive salad that added pecans and goat cheese to the crunchy lettuce, and swamped them in a sherry vinaigrette that was thicker and more opaque than its name suggests. It’s a dish that disappeared from the menu last week but will be back next year, when the seasons change again. ', 'That dish really just shows that you can’t go wrong picking vegetables as your meal at Pheasant. This is especially true with the single vegetarian entrée ($18) — itself an inviolable trope of neighborhood bistro menus. Here, it is based on boxcars of polenta that have been deep fried, resulting in audible crunch and a supremely corny flavor. You’ll be teasing them out from their forest of ‘shrooms as you sop up the ramp chimichurri with the focaccia ($6) you should have ordered at the commencement of the meal.', 'As if to balance out the vegetarian entrée, a juicy hamburger is also available, but not just any hamburger. It comes with slices of kielbasa on top, maybe to remind you what lurks on the other side of the BQE.  (Answer: Polish Greenpoint). And the burger isn’t the messiest thing on the menu: One upping Buffalo, a plate of chicken wings comes so drenched in scarlet sauce that it will leave fingers, face, and shirtfront comically smeary. Moist wipes are provided.', 'As with many bistros of this sort, the larger dishes can seem a bit flat compared with the smaller ones. A nicely-browned half chicken comes on a bed of yellow rice with a dipping sauce and side salad. While perfectly satisfying and plenty of food at the price ($21), it doesn’t really light a fire under your tastebuds. Similarly, a large plate of hanger steak cuts plenty of medium rare meat into big cubes, but leaves you wishing the steak had been left intact without the distraction of roasted turnips.', 'But these are small quibbles on a menu whose excitement is deeply ingrained, one of those where the challenge is not finding something you want to eat, but in eliminating those dishes that don’t sound quite as good as others. Ultimately, my only regret after several visits was that there’s no pheasant on the menu at Pheasant.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including three smaller and one larger dish, and two cocktails or glasses of wine, plus tax but not tip, $90.', 'Sample dishes: yellowtail crudo with avocado puree (fish selection varies), fried polenta and mushroom ragout, grilled ground-lamb skewers, asparagus with ham and potato-leek soubise', 'What to drink: Beer, wine, and invented cocktails available, the latter strong and thus not a bad deal at $12. The wine list is particularly good for a neighborhood bistro, with a focus on orange wines and fizzy wines, including a lambrusco great for summer drinking, priced at $45.', 'Bonus tip: The most enjoyable seats are at the bar as the sun sets under the BQE, where you could enjoy a couple of smaller plates and a glass of wine as a delightful and thoroughly seasonal meal.']"
37,"['Old laundromats have been getting a new lease on urban life lately. And in San Francisco, not surprisingly, that means restaurant leases — from Tide Pods to table, so to speak. ', 'I’ve lived in this city long enough that I used to do laundry where Nopa now serves burgers. But in the last year alone, the Doug’s Suds in Cole Valley has become a coffee shop called Wooden that is, yes, heavily wooded, with a resident wise-cracking parrot. In the Tenderloin, Barnzu serves Korean small plates where soiled pants were once cleaned. And in late May, on a quiet midday stretch of Market Street, the 52-year-old Little Hollywood Launderette became Kantine, San Francisco’s first Scandinavian half-day cafe. ', 'Tucked between an HIV testing center and the once-iconic Orbit Room, the unassuming, window-walled space now serves smorrebrod and savory porridge from 7:30 a.m. until 3 p.m., when chef Nichole Accettola and her Danish-born husband and co-owner Joachim Majholm’s three kids get out of school. ', 'Some neighbors were upset about the loss of their long-standing convenience. I don’t blame them. Doing laundry is a necessity — eating pork liver pate with pickled beets is not.', '\n    Related\n  ', 'But on a recent Wednesday around 2 p.m., one white-haired, ruddy-cheeked couple was quite pleased. Wearing wool V-neck sweaters over white collars, creased slacks, and complementary caps, they clinked half-pints of lager and bellowed something cheery in Swedish. ', 'In a town where the closest thing to a quick Scandinavian lunch has been the Swedish meatballs at Emeryville’s Ikea, clearly they were excited to have a place to come for pickled herring and lingcod fish cakes.', 'I order both, too, served as smorrebrod, or open-faced sandwiches. The lingcod fish cake is a cumulus cloud grounded by a single buttered slice of Danish sprouted rye. The fish itself is a bit bland, but offset by a chunky remoulade of pickled vegetables, capers, and tarragon, and the honeyed crunch of apple slaw, the sum total is lovely.', 'Until it’s in season here, Accettola gets her herring, whole, from Alaska. She fillets it, leaving the skin on one side; the other is brushed with Dijon and chopped dill. Then she dredges the fillets in rye flour before pan-frying and submerging in pickling brine. It’s served open-faced, on a small, buttered square of Danish sprouted rye bread. It’s dense and slightly sweet, dolled up with fuchsia curls of pickled onions and wisps of fresh dill. I can’t help but consider the smorrebrod a healthy, high-protein snack compared to the bulky loaves busting with fatty porchetta from Tartine Manufactory or pulled pork from 4504, the buttery biscuit-bacon-and-egg gut bombs from Devil’s Teeth or the oozy-cheesy Romanian pastrami-brisket from the Deli Board that have collectively come to define the sandwich in San Francisco; and let us not forget the the cocktail-drenched bacchanal that has become brunch. ', 'Kantine offers an antidote: a civilized, Copenhagen-inspired counter to the gluttony. It’s an experiment in portion control, really, proving that a couple little bites of a lot of things can be just as, if not more, satisfying as many of one. Picture an airplane tray topped with the quality of food you’d expect from a fine dining-trained chef who worked around the clock with star chefs Barbara Lynch and Todd English in Boston, then fled to Copenhagen for 15 years — and brought a bit of Danish life back with her. ', 'Here, a “board” is a literal slab of blonde wood configured with five ($15) or seven ($19) daily-changing items — chosen from a thoughtfully curated mix of a dozen or so — which you check off, like a form at the doctor’s office. It’s a choose-your-own Scandinavian-esque adventure, complete with three types of rye (sprouted, lacy cracker, or crispbread disc, which is more like the size of a vinyl record). Supremely silky local salmon, cured with salt and a touch of sugar, pink peppercorn and fennel, arrives thinly sliced — and unaccompanied by the obligatory big, fat bagel. Two tender strips of house-smoked bacon, spiced with juniper berry and coriander, come curled alone in a tiny bowl; there is no heaping side of hash browns in sight. A simple glass of diced cantaloupe, sprinkled with a sweetened mix of mint and tarragon, is in itself an “item” — and a worthy one at that. ', 'Not all items are created equal, however. A couple cry for more salt or more seasoning or more something, like the three-lentil hummus. Hummus isn’t Scandinavian, of course, but as northern Europeans join the movement to eat less meat and more vegetables, it’s become a new staple. Sadly, the unfortunate-looking mound of lentil hummus lacked both flavor and visual appeal, making it the biggest disappointment of the bunch. ', 'The bay shrimp, too, though pretty and pink, were as bland as I feared they might be. Scraping the bottom of the glass and stirring the dill and hard-boiled egg and house mayo together helped a little, but not enough to make me want to order it again.', 'Other dishes, though, literally brought me — in my Saucony sneakers — running back one morning: a yolky organic egg, floating in a bright-green pond of creamy spinach; a mildly curried egg salad with slivers of radish. A little glass lined with a creamy hay-smoked cheese topped with cherry tomatoes, cucumber slices, and sprouts was so simple and vitalizing I felt like the epitome of health just eating it. (Paging Gwyneth Paltrow. For better or worse, the GOOPies would love this place.)', 'I do too. Everything at Kantine is on theme without being kitschy. Lattes come in Ikea glass mugs. Dido occasionally plays overhead. Table tags come with band names I’ve never heard of. (Biosphere? Efterklang?) I got Lars Ulrich almost every time. Maybe one day Metallica’s Marin-based drummer will come in and get himself?', 'Though, to be clear, cozy-hygge Kantine is not. Nor is it trying to be. “Kantine” is Danish for canteen: a place for hungry people to commune and consume. And so, it’s appropriately cavernous, at times chaotic, with a clean lines-cum-cafeteria aesthetic. Its holdover cement floors are heavily scuffed. Dirty mini dishes quickly pile up on your table. And on a crowded Sunday, the place heats up like a Finnish sauna. (How fitting.) ', 'Still, Kantine gives the city something it has been missing, something that, as a free-roaming freelancer with a flexible lunch hour, I’ve been missing: a daytime cafe that feels as fresh and refreshing as the creamy-cold glass of thinned orange-muddled yogurt I ordered as a kick-off to all four of my meals. (I don’t think I’ve drank that much calcium since I was a kid.) ', 'Perhaps most impressively, though, Accettola has managed to pull off something even rarer for a chef with her pedigree, in this competitive city: running what I predict will be a successful restaurant where she makes everything from scratch at a sustainable pace. Kantine operates at hours that work for her and her customers, with actually affordable prices — where a big, hearty bowl of purple barley and brown-rice porridge, brimming with kale, crimini mushrooms, and farmer cheese, stirred with sweet yolk and salty nubs of bacon, costs about as much as a single load of laundry. ', 'What it costs: $15 for a brunch board with 5 items, $19 for 7 items; smorrebrod are $10 to $11; between 7:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. it’s primarily porridge, yogurt, and pastries. Boards begin at 9 a.m.', 'What to eat: Porridge (savory or sweet); pickled herring smorrebrod; the runny organic egg with creamed spinach; cured salmon; melon with tarragon; Danish blue cheese and fig spread; specials like the smoked trout rillettes; Karelian (a delicate, savory, rice-filled pastry); all three breads.', 'What to drink: Choose from a half a dozen fine wines and a handful of beers and cider, but the two house-made nonalcoholic options are outstanding: a rhubarb drink on the rocks and that orange-yogurt drink, which surpasses my fondest Orange Julius memories.', 'Bonus tip: Kantine has a small wholesale business in the works — look out for the Danish sprouted bread at shops like Bi-Rite, plus the possibility of occasional dinners.', '', '', 'Sign up for our newsletter.', '']"

', 'Instead, I saw a Donald Trump pinata, dangling not unlike a dead man, from the store next door. And it made my meal of chef Nite Yun’s Cambodian street food even better. I found it satisfying to eat dinner cooked by a member of America’s immigrant community in the symbolic face of a president working to keep immigrants out of America.

Her family of five eventually landed in a small apartment in Stockton, California, home to one of the country’s largest Cambodian communities. Raised in her mother’s kitchen, filled with the smell of fresh-cut lemongrass, she was later inspired to return to Cambodia, to learn about her family and taste her culinary roots.

As outpriced San Franciscans continue to invade Oakland, it’s easy to envision the Fruitvale Public Market one day morphing into a mini Ferry Plaza, complete with $4 peaches and $50 boxes of chocolate. But if change means more fantastic locally owned businesses like Nyum Bai, dedicated to enriching the community rather than bulldozing it, the future looks bright.', '', 'Inside Nyum Bai, it does too. The decor is airy and light, an upbeat palette of white, pale blues, neon accents, and millennial pink. Paper-wrapped chopsticks protrude from jasmine tea tins. Even the bathroom is somewhere you kind of want to stay a while — clad in wallpaper custom-designed by local illustrator Ratha Nou, featuring a mix of Oakland’s famed shipping cranes and faces of 1960s Cambodian rock stars like Pan Ron and Sinn Sisamouth. The same voices are behind the the music playing softly overhead and the colorful retro album covers that adorn the wall.', 'It’s all intended to buck our longtime association of Cambodia with its dark days, bringing us back to the country’s golden era. And it works. ', 'The place, and its people, exude a kind of homey warmth and genuineness I haven’t experienced much lately on the San Francisco side of the bridge. It also serves the kind of unique, deeply flavorful, very affordable food I haven’t eaten much of lately on that side of the bridge. ', 'Take amok, a curried fish souffle, steamed with coconut milk in banana leaf; koh, tender, caramelized pork belly and lightly fried tofu simmered in a coconut-soy broth; and lively ngoum, banana-blossom salad with crunchy sticks of cabbage and basil in a sweet lime dressing. It’s all served tableside, no less. You remember low-key sit-down restaurants, right? ', 'Were Nyum Bai on, say, hip Hayes Street, it would no doubt be a fast-casual situation. I admit, I found myself feeling relieved, even relaxed, when I walked in and realized it wasn’t. (Am I tiring of ordering a multi-dish meal at a counter already? Maybe.)', 'The sad thing is that a place like Nyum Bai would likely never open on Hayes Street, let alone anywhere in 2018 San Francisco, where the costs of running a restaurant are astronomical, including rents up to three times that of Oakland.', 'Owning a restaurant in Fruitvale, however, is far less expensive. And Yun’s growing fan base benefits: Her priciest dish is $15.95. A creamy cardamom-coconut curry with braised short ribs in Oakland or a Pimm’s cup in San Francisco? Take your pick. ', 'The sadder thing: A place like Nyum Bai couldn’t open at all without Kickstarter, yes, but also without assistance from food incubator nonprofits like La Cocina, whose primary mission is to help low-income women from immigrant communities realize their professional dreams. ', 'One could argue that the industry is tough for anyone trying to open a restaurant, regardless of race or gender. But for the women La Cocina supports, that deck is stacked particularly high. This is expressly why the organization launched in the Bay Area in 2005 —and why a cook like Yun was able to go from her mother’s kitchen to culinary entrepreneur to chef-owner of a restaurant — a restaurant so good, mind you, it’s in the top five of my running mental list and among Oakland’s top 18, according to my colleague Bill Addison.', 'Yun spent a year perfecting her mother’s recipe for kuy teav, a classic rice-noodle soup, before debuting it at her first San Francisco pop-up in 2014. She later moved to a kiosk at Emeryville’s Public Market. And now, at her first brick-and-mortar restaurant, the kuy teav “Phnom Penh” — dried shrimp and minced pork in a light, subtly sweet seven-hour pork broth brimming with fresh herbs and flecks of fried garlic — is just one star on a menu filled with them. ', 'Condiment caddy', 'The restaurant serves 15 or so items, split into three loosely defined categories. My glistening pile of ginger fried chicken was slotted under “Snacks,” but in both size and sticky, crackling satisfaction, it was so much more. Even San Tung’s dry fried wings have got nothing on Yun’s. ', 'Another supposed snack was skewers of grilled beef. Marinated in an umami-packed mix of fish sauce, honey, and lemongrass, countered by wisps of chile powder-dusted pickled papaya, the dish could have easily doubled as a small plate. ', 'The condiment caddy deserves a category all its own. It’s a quadrant that includes a fiery hot sauce — a family recipe made with chiles dried over a wood fire — and something Westerners typically only offer with coffee: sugar. Sugar is a staple, our server explains. “Cambodians sprinkle it like salt.”', 'Tempting, but to me, the wilted stalks of garlicky water spinach delicately stir-fried and speckled with salted soybeans are perfect without it. So too is the kuy teav cha, which may have forever ruined me for pad Thai. The slippery rice noodles are stir-fried with dark soy and tamarind, touched with palm sugar, and blanketed by a sunny-side-up egg — further proof that a sweet yolk enhances everything.  ', 'As did knowing that the hundred bucks or so our foursome spent eating almost the entire menu supports a supremely talented, self-taught chef — a woman who has opened just the kind of restaurant America needs more of. ', 'What it costs: About $50 for two snacks or small plates, two big plates, and a couple of beers.', 'What to eat: Everything, other than maybe the mild kuri moan, which was too mild for my tastes. And especially the ginger fried chicken, prahok ktiss (the aforementioned minced-pork dip), amok, and kuy teav (Phnom Penh and cha).', 'What to drink: Beverage options basically boiled down to an Oakland-brewed IPA or an iced matcha tea with almond milk, both delicious. Californian wines are on the way.', 'Bonus tip: Outside patio seating in the Oakland sun.', 'Disclosure: Rachel Levin is a contributing committee member to Voices from the Kitchen, a live storytelling project created by La Cocina.']"
39,"['Crackling pork belly and crunchy squid beautifully sputter at the New Jersey import', 'Who doesn’t love hash? Though the term is originally French, this mince-up of meat morsels is common to many culinary cultures as a method of using scraps and leftovers. One of the tastiest comes from the island of Luzon in the Philippines, home to the capital of Manila. Dubbed sisig, it started out as a tart papaya salad in the 18th century (“sisigan” means “to make it tart” in Tagalog), but by the 20th century, it was being fabricated with finely minced pig-head and liver. According to one story, this version was invented by local Filipinos using pig parts discarded by cooks at an American Air Force base in Angeles City.', 'True story or not, sisig exploded in popularity after World War II, when the larders of the country expanded, and cooks began using other main ingredients. When the dish came to be served in a hot cast-iron skillet as a favorite street food, an alliterative modifier was added and “sizzling sisig” was born. Its popularity here in America only increased when Anthony Bourdain lauded it as a drinking snack: “I think sisig is perfectly positioned to win the hearts and minds of the world as a whole…exactly what you need after a few beers.”', 'Mama Fina’s House of Filipino Sisig seems intent on fulfilling that promise. This new Alphabet City restaurant is a branch of an Elmwood Park, New Jersey mainstay that opened in 2004. Occupying the former Moonstruck Eatery on Avenue A just south of 11th Street, the bar and dining room have been decorated with Philippine fork art: rustic pottery, sculptures made from screws and bolts, and peacock serving trays of inlaid tropical woods. Ornate wrought-iron lamps, flagstone floor, and weathered wood walls also fill the space.', 'Chef Aming Sta Maria (pronounced “Santa Maria”) is responsible for a bill of fare that offers six sizzling sisigs ($17 each). There’s the pork prototype, of course, which she makes not with pig head but with pork belly, which includes crackling skin and plenty of meat and fat, delivered to the table sputtering. The squid sisig outdoes it in the crunch department, though chopped so fine it’s difficult to make out individual pieces of mollusk. The tofu sisig boasts a nicely browned dice of firm bean curd, lots of purple onions, and a white gravy that tastes like coconut milk and mayo, though there’s no actual coconut in it. But we’ll never really know what’s in it, because the sisig recipes are Sta Maria’s carefully guarded secret.', 'Chicken sisig isn’t as good because the chicken registers as limp and bland compared with the other key ingredients. If you want chicken, go for the menu section called Philippine Barbecue. Chicken wings grilled till the skin is smoky and partly blackened is painted with a peanut sauce that owes less to peanut butter and more to barbecue sauce. It comes with a vinegary dip and a mound of java rice, which is orange with turmeric and slightly spicy.', 'My favorite dish also deploys peanuts. Kare-kare ($24) is an oxtail stew with thick peanut gravy, which exudes flavors of garlic and onions, savory without a trace of sweetness. Bonus green beans and okra are flung on top; mix them in or pick them off to eat separately, as you wish. Among the other massive feeds is crispy pata, a heap of roast pork piled helter skelter on a tray, a perfect dish for those who like to poke among the fragments for the fattiest or crispest pieces. This dish would be equally at home in a Greenpoint Polish restaurant.', 'Despite the predominance of pork, chicken, and seafood as the focus of most dishes, veggies are not entirely neglected. Laing is a mound of coarsely chopped taro leaves in thick coconut milk, with several shrimp riding shotgun on top. Langka is a similar dish, made with jackfruit, a starchy football that gets tossed with chunks of pork in coconut sauce. This pairing is particularly interesting, because unripe jackfruit is sometimes thought of as a pork substitute. The color of the dish is an arresting shade of off-white.', 'Breakfast is a Filipino passion, and a roster is offered throughout the day even though the restaurant doesn’t open till 2 p.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. All breakfasts consist of a pair of over-easy eggs and a heap of garlic rice, plus a choice of grilled longanisa sausage, a pile of sweet pork, or one of two milkfish options. Also known as bangus, the fish is offered whole, and picking it apart is a pleasant challenge. Eat the skin, too.', 'Save room for dessert. The flan is firm and nicely coated with burnt sugar syrup, the fried bananas known as turon might be mistaken for lumpia until you bite into them, but best of all is halo-halo ($12), a shaved ice speckled with seemingly random ingredients like red beans and kernel corn in a sweet syrup. On top is a ball of ice cream so intensely purple, you might have dropped acid before eating it. What’s the flavor? Ube, a purple yam that’s only one of the many, many attractions of Filipino cuisine.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one sisig and rice, a vegetable dish such as laing, and halo-halo dessert, plus two beers, including tax but not tip, $55.', 'Sample dishes: tofu sizzling sisig, smoked bangus breakfast, crispy pata (roast pork), leche flan', 'What to Drink: Philippine San Miguel beer or canned calanmasi soft drink, made with miniature citrus fruits native to the islands.', 'Bonus tip: You are well advised to go to Mama Fina’s with a group and try lots of things. Also, the serving size for most dishes is gigantic, each easily satisfying three or four diners. Not all dishes are available every day, so consult the online menu and call ahead to ensure availability.', '']"
40,"['San Francisco needed this: a massive, airy, sun-strewn space to eat and drink where we can show up on a whim without worrying about wind or a wait. And if it happens to serve wiener schnitzel, well, then wiener schnitzel is what we’ll have. The bonus is that it’s Radhaus’s wiener schnitzel — a thinly pounded, flawlessly fried slab of pork, splattered with an herbaceous creme fraiche. It’s so big it barely fits in its white enamel tray, dishware I call “camping chic.”', 'I wasn’t necessarily craving another restaurant with ginormous portions of heavy German food. After all, we’ve got plenty: Leopold’s and Walzwerk, and Suppenküche and Biergarten — the two Hayes Valley Bavarian-style hotspots that twins Aaron and Matt Hulme own in addition to their brand new Radhaus in Fort Mason. Clearly, though, the brothers believe the city has an ever-increasing appetite for pork sausage and pilsner. ', 'Despite several supersized dishes, Radhaus is lighter than the rest. Consider it Suppenküche’s carefree, oh-so Californian daughter: stylish, a little more health conscious, always wearing sunglasses, even inside. (With a wall of windowpanes revealing the autumn sun, sailboats, and the Golden Gate Bridge beyond, we did.)', 'Thanks to the view and some 25-foot ceilings, the inside feels like outside, only louder. A humongous 300-year-old hunk of a 200-foot Ponderosa pine, carved by beloved West Marin woodworker Evan Shively, serves as the bar. And behind it is a backsplash of white tiles, giving the place a squeaky-clean shower-house look. Except in lieu of nozzles, there are 13 artful taps: one fashioned from the brothers’ late father’s favorite pipe, another carved from a Mt. Tam tree branch struck by lightning. Also, because this is the Bay Area, there is an antique doorknob spouting a local ginger-lime kombucha. ', 'The menu is the size of a Fillmore poster, broken into a loquacious mix of sections (“breakfast”; “second breakfast”; “snacks”; “brotzeit”; “luncheon”; “supper”; “dinner”) and time slots (“eleven to two” and “eleven to two (and) after five”). I get it, but it requires more brain power than a beer hall’s menu should. ', 'While you parse it over a rare Rothaus, it would seem like a no-brainer to start with a Pretzelina. Thinner and denser than the traditional puffy standard, sprinkled with Maldon flakes and flanked by freshly grated horseradish, it’s lovely — dainty, even. But on all three visits, I found it underwhelming, dry, and almost — dare I say? — stale. Apparently, the guy seated at the next table had similar feelings. “I had a better pretzel last night at the A’s game,” he claimed. Regardless, any Bavarian-style place with a supposedly soft knot on its menu should make sure it’s a good one. ', 'I much preferred to start with the mountain cheese, a mesh of ethereally thin, creamy-smooth curls of Swiss-like cheese from California’s central coast, drizzled with walnut oil, and the cucumber salad, a jumble of crisp cubes tossed with red onion and dill in a zingy Champagne vinaigrette. ', 'It was a wholesome beginning that came to a heart attack-inducing stop with the arrival of our biggest mis-order of the evening: the griebenschmalz, a mini Mason jar of cold, congealed chicken fat topped with chopped Granny Smith apples, served on a plate scattered with tooth-breaking gnarls of fried chicken skin and crackers, which chipped immediately upon dipping, or more accurately, digging. Either way, the schmaltz itself wasn’t worth the effort. It was a jar of flavorless, cloudy, crystalized chub that disappeared on my tongue, in a way that made me wonder why anyone would deem such a thing worth eating.', 'Other “after five” options (i.e., dinner) went downhill from there. The half-chicken came stabbed in the breast with a dagger. With saggy skin and less-than-juicy meat, it was more dramatic than delicious. Its side of bread dumplings wooed me on the menu, but despite glistening with pan sauce, they were dry and dense. Stalks of tender, well-seasoned roasted broccoli rabe tucked beneath saved the dish from being a total disappointment. ', 'On another visit, I let our server talk me into the bierwurst, and I wished I hadn’t. Maybe because he was a dead ringer for Rolf in the Sound of Music, whom I totally had a tweenage crush on. ', '“It’s like bratwurst made with Fort Point Westfalia beer,” he promised. But I was ultimately turned off by the two pudgy pork sausages, which, although grilled, tasted more like boiled mystery meat than beer-infused meat. A mushy mound of rotkohl, red cabbage, didn’t help matters. After a couple of bites, I dove my fork into my date’s plate instead: The traditional bratwurst was by far the better order, a quartet of chewy, slightly charred links scattered with fried shallots, over a bed of sauerkraut.', 'Overall, as far as food- and beer-induced fun, Radhaus is at its best during lunch — when the chicken schnitzel sandwich is as crisp, delightful, and downright beautiful as the view. It’s a slender, juicy thigh, heavily breaded in crumbs from Mayfield Bakery and set between two slices of toasted French bread, with electric-pink pickled onion, crisp cabbage and cucumbers and a touch of dill, dripping in a tangy buttermilk sauce. ', 'On one recent Sunday afternoon, the bay was sparkling and the Fort Mason Farmers Market was in full swing, and our party of six piled in, sans reservation. I fully expected to hear the requisite “it’ll be an hour” and instead, we were seated within five minutes. ', 'Radhaus’s slotted wood tables were filled with frat guys and families, logo-clad techies and Fisherman’s Wharf-bound tourists — disparate demographics you don’t often see sitting side by side in this siloed city. Together we downed refreshing Radlers (Andech Helles mixed with lemon soda). We slurped soulful bowls full of pork broth, floating with a plump, super-mild weisswurst, little lily pads of fresh herbs, and a delicately poached egg: an ideal antidote to a hangover, especially when paired with a fiery, unadorned Bloody Magdalena, served in a rocks glass with Austrian vodka and a healthy splash of lime. ', 'That’s what I like best about Radhaus. It has room for everybody — as a former WWII U.S. Army post-turned-restaurant located within a Golden Gate National Recreation Area should. The only not-so democratic thing about the place is — surprise, surprise — its prices. ', 'At $22, a liter of imported Schneider Edelweisse beer will cost you two bucks more than a plate of Radhaus’s ribs, which are hefty, doused in a tomato-based barbecue sauce, and fork-tender, but nothing to trek to Fort Mason for. True, a liter is a lot of beer. And, of course, you could always order a half-liter, at half the price. But either way, here’s betting you’ll order more, maybe many more. After all, that’s why you came here, isn’t it? At Radhaus, every day is Oktoberfest. A sophisticated, San Francisco-style Oktoberfest.', 'Ultimately, though, it’s neither the wiener schnitzel nor the Weihenstephan Hefeweissbier that would bring me back to what will undoubtedly be Fort Mason’s new mainstay. It’s the soaring, gorgeous space itself — and the rare ability to stroll in with friends, or family, at any hour (be it “eleven to two” or “after five”) for a perfectly fine meal, with four-star scenery. Radhaus is a good reminder that sometimes, even in food-obsessed San Francisco, it’s okay to merely like your meal, if you love where you’re eating it.', 'What it costs: For two liters of beer, a couple of snacks, one large plate, and two entrees, call it close to $200 before tax or tip.', 'What to drink: The Radler was refreshing, but in general, I found the heavier (Andechs Doppelbock Dunkel) or hoppier (Schneider Hopfenweisse) beers more satisfying than the lighter ones. There’s a short list of German and Austrian wines, too. And for kids, the Kinderbier: Radhaus’s version of a Shirley Temple.', 'What to eat: Smoked sturgeon toast, chicken schnitzel sandwich, mountain cheese, fresh weisswurst, wiener schnitzel, and bratwurst. ', 'Bonus: It’s surely being on the bay in Fort Mason where there are art galleries, the Sunday farmers market, the beloved FLAX art supply store, and intriguing Tuesday-eve “salon talks” at the Interval next door.', 'Eater rates restaurants on a scale of zero to four stars, taking into consideration food, atmosphere, service, value, and the context of the restaurant within the larger dining landscape.

41,"['Marie-Aude Rose’s first U.S. restaurant is gorgeous, buttery, and very pricey', 'Anyone who understands a cafe to be an informal hangout for nibbling and lingering — a “small restaurant where simple fare and drinks are served,” as the Cambridge dictionary puts it — will be forgiven for strolling into La Mercerie without a reservation or a lot of cash. The Soho newcomer does, after all, claim to celebrate the “thoughtful delights of everyday French cooking.” ', 'But this particular cafe sits inside the Roman and Williams Guild, a design emporium that sells the artisanal dinnerware patrons use during meal service. Cards on every table advertise the lofty prices; a single earthenware teacup and saucer runs $125. And that nice ottoman just outside the dining room? It’s $10,000.', 'An all-day place for an impromptu rendezvous with a colleague this is not — not with $32 white asparagus salads, and not with the lack of dedicated seating for walk-ins after 12 p.m. There are no bar stools. There is no takeout except for pastries and espresso. And virtually any lunchtime table can book a week out. If this sounds outrageous for a place that sells crepes and coffee, well, it kind of is. But at least there’s a good reason for the demand: Marie-Aude Rose is the chef. ', 'She makes really good crepes. Ambitious New York chefs don’t tend to iterate on that Parisian street staple, nor do they tend to serve tuna-fish sandwiches for dinner like Rose does. The prevailing resurgence of French food in Manhattan has taken a variety of forms, from hip small plates spots with natural wines to haute-poultry purveyors to exalted tasting palaces. What distinguishes La Mercerie — and what ranks it as one of the most compelling Gallic spots of the past decade — is its unusual dedication to riffing on humble French-cafe fare.', 'A waiter ferries over a white plate covered by a craggy grey dome. This is the grilled buckwheat crepe; it hides a soft pile of chicken cut with carrots (for sweetness), cream (for richness), and tarragon (for aroma). You use the earthy pancake, which is crisp like a dosa, to scoop up the meaty bits with your hands. It’s not so much a standard portable crepe as something that could hold its own at a Michelin-starred establishment. ', 'Or consider a single soft-boiled egg. Rose places it atop cauliflower-tofu puree, speckles it with breadcrumbs, and anoints it with a few wisps of Parmesan. The flavors express themselves with such breathtaking clarity — the vegetal punch of the chou-fleur, the opulence of the golden yolk, the umami-richness of the cheese — that one wonders why Robuchon isn’t selling these at his slick chef’s counter. Rose asks $15 for this masterpiece. ', 'La Mercerie isn’t really an everyday cafe; it’s rather a Nancy Meyers-esque, upper-class fantasy of one. Cue the plush aqua mohair banquettes, the $6 croissants (Balthazar charges $3.75), the rustic linen napkins (take home four for $105), and the in-house florist peddling curvy myrtle topiaries.', 'These frivolities notwithstanding, it’s a heck of a debut for Rose. She’s a Parisian chef who’s worked in the kitchens of Guy Savoy and Pierre Gagnaire, two of the world’s most celebrated practitioners of haute gastronomy, as well as that of Daniel Rose, a Chicago-born culinarian famous for his dressed-down approach to fine dining at Spring. Daniel hired Marie as Spring’s first cook. The duo married and moved to New York in 2016 so Daniel could open Le Coucou, an awesome (and expensive) ode to the grand French dining rooms of yesteryear. ', 'La Mercerie, located a few blocks away from Le Coucou and run by the same operator, Stephen Starr, is cheaper and more casual by design — but no less technical or studied in its fare. There’s probably not a single tasting-menu venue in New York with a more comprehensive butter program.', 'Accompanying Cantabric anchovies are butter sticks laden with as much vanilla as ice cream, acting as a gently sweet counterpart to the assertively saline fish. Patrons spread sourdough slices with a lemon butter that’s as aromatic as sorbet, or a speckled buckwheat butter packing the aromas of an autumnal bonfire. But best of all is when the kitchen sends out icy Kushi oysters with pats of seaweed butter. The bivalve is refreshingly cucumber-y, while the nori-spiked dairy, smeared on a rye cracker, amps up the umami factor with a more powerful burst of brine.', 'Fans of the trendier aspects of all-day dining, take note: There are no grain bowls, chia puddings, or bespoke-blend burgers here. In the morning, you come for crisp ham and cheese croissants; they smell richly of dairy, as much a product of the buttery laminated dough as the heady, 18-month-aged Comté. In the afternoon, you come for a rare filet, doused in cognac sauce, and paired with tangy blue cheese pommes dauphine. And on a sweaty summer evening, you come for the salad nicoise, with a pile of slow-cooked tuna, green beans, and olives drenched in enough pungent anchovy vinaigrette to make the palate beg for Champagne.', 'If your table isn’t ready, hosts might suggest strolling back into the guild itself, where you can admire a soft reindeer pelt over a bespoke couch ($16,000) or negotiate the angles of a cubist chair that looks plucked from the set of Beetlejuice ($30,000). There’s nothing uncommon about mixing restaurants and retail; Bloomingdales, ABC Home, and other department stores have a long history of hosting culinary establishments. The reason for these mashups are as simple as a buffet in a Vegas casino: to keep people inside and to keep them spending. ', 'But at La Mercerie, where the cost of goods is so completely out of reach to so many, the restaurant rather takes on the air of an aspirational advertisement, a postcard from a fictional millionaire’s lifestyle. And in this regard, one has to ask whether Starr, one of the country’s most successful independent restaurateurs, could’ve found a larger space for Rose’s stunning cooking, rather than place her cafe in a store where a sofa costs more than a Ford Fiesta sedan.', 'It would be nice to see more folks sample Rose’s stellar boeuf bourguignon, a shimmering red-wine braise that sits over a pile of firm, buttered penne, or her epic roast chicken, deboned and with the skin as crunchy as the layers of mille-feuille. Just when the salty bliss of the bird starts to shock the palate, something unusual resets it: garlic-ginger nougatine, discs of sugar-enriched allium that Rose should sell by the bag as candy.', 'One last note: If New York is having a bit of a pastry moment right now, La Mercerie is sometimes a laggard in this regard. Rose’s torteau fromager, a French cheesecake made from chevre, recalled an arid poundcake on a recent visit. Profiteroles — pastry puffs filled with ice cream — had about as much flavor as matzoh and quickly took on a stiff texture. Ananas and kirsch — pineapple slices doused in cherry brandy — evoked diced supermarket fruit doused in an indistinct spirit. ', 'Then there’s Rose’s orange-flower-water-laced brioche, which might be one of the sweets of the century. In the morning, she cuts a single generous slice into four oversized batons and stands them up in a bowl of creme anglaise. Guests nibble and dunk as if these were toast soldiers, letting the eggy sauce fortify the obscenely rich bread. I’ve never encountered something so aromatically indulgent in a cafe, which is why it seems perfect in this whimsical, flawed, beautiful daydream of one.', 'Cost: Starters at $9-$21; mains, salads, and crepes at $18-$37. Expect to spend about $120 per person after tax and tip at dinner. An Americano (La Colombe, $5.50) and a croissant ($6) at the takeout counter will run about $13 after tax, which is a lot.', 'Sample dishes: Ham and cheese croissant ($11), brioche with creme anglaise ($8), salad nicoise ($27), anchovies with vanilla butter ($21), oysters with seaweed butter (2 for $10), chicken with garlic-ginger nougatine ($33), filet with pommes dauphine ($37).', 'Bonus Tip: La Mercerie is walk-in only until noon. Lunch tables can book up a week out or more, while evening bookings tend to fill up between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Outside of breakfast, walk-ins have the best luck between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. A few stools near the window allow for daytime pastry eating.']"
42,"['The sky-high French restaurant is a gift for its stunning views and accessible price point, though the food is less memorable', 'Right before the end credits of Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man (2002), superhero journalist Peter Parker swings through a sun-drenched Manhattan as if it were a schoolyard jungle gym. Viewers watch from up close as Spidey hurdles himself past a cluster of Midtown high-rises, an exuberant perspective that exaggerates the city’s sumptuous vertical topography. That bit of fiction is one of the first things that came to mind while dining at Manhatta, Danny Meyer’s new French spot in the Financial District; the 60th floor digs afford such intimate views of neighboring towers that the effect is like a comic. Everything is larger than life.', 'An elevator slingshots diners skyward. Thirty seconds later, they’re nearly 800 feet above street level, gazing down upon the East River and its graceful bridges. Manhatta’s dim lighting and neutral browns (think: wood-paneled floors, walnut-hued tables, and leather sofas) speak to a simple design ethos: Don’t distract from the view. Giant windows provide an IMAX-style panorama, framing the quartz-like asymmetries of Hudson Yards, the polychrome of the Empire State, and the Jenga-like stacking of 56 Leonard — just a hang-glider ride away in Tribeca.', 'Patrons who head to the main room for, say, lobster quenelles — the bulky crustacean transformed into ethereal fluff — will encounter another treat: the Art Deco 70 Pine. The building’s lithe spire looms so large it’s like dining near a Depression-era fantasy of a spaceship. And if that’s still not vivid enough, kindly put down your Champagne and pick up that pair of binoculars on the windowsill. You can see families watching Monday night football in the chic Frank Gehry building across the way.', 'New York feels bigger, grander, and more alive at Manhatta, with the surrounding buildings in conversation rather than in competition with one another. It’s a welcome contrast to our increasingly sterile billionaire’s metropolis, where eight-figure dwellings and exorbitant observation decks rise so high that everything below appears tinier and flatter, more like a Google Earth satellite image than the richly textured city we know.', 'The price is right here too. In the smattering of Manhattan bars and restaurants with serious views, admission comes with an elevation upcharge; one thinks of the $25 cocktails at the Aviary, or the upper floors at One World Trade, where the entrance fees can top out at $130 for two — before food. Meyer, by contrast, keeps things a bit more reasonable; he asks $78, service included, for three courses. Gourmands could easily spend more on a ground-level meal in Midtown. ', 'For restaurants at altitude, Manhatta might be the city’s best deal. And while the dining room books up a solid month in advance, the chef’s counter and a la carte bar, which boast some of the best sightlines here, are reserved for walk-ins. ', 'One can simply swing by the south lounge for a daiquiri at sunset, watching the sky turn pink over the turquoise dome of 40 Wall Street — a neo-Gothic gem from the 1930s — while the Statue of Liberty shines below in the harbor. It’s a view you won’t find anywhere else in the city, and it’s a calming prelude to snacks at the counter, perhaps an order of croque-madames, a trio of deliciously messy mini-toasts stacked with ham, quail egg, and bechamel, for just $10. ', 'There are also tempura scallops on par with the catering operations at a good wedding hall.', 'Manhatta’s cooking, courtesy of Gramercy Tavern and Per Se vet Jason Pfeifer, sometimes does such an efficient job at not competing with the vistas that you practically forget what you’re eating halfway through a given course. A crimson puck of tarragon-laced tuna tartare, next to a few pretty lettuce leaves, serves as an inoffensive protein delivery mechanism, dissolving on the tongue without much heat or acidity. It is simply food. Cavatelli, in turn, is virtually indistinguishable from other generic pasta dishes around the city; it’s a ho-hum melange of tomato, sauce, and pecorino. It is plain nourishment. ', 'The token vegetarian option, zucchini and squash roulade, is best described as cooked vegetables on a plate.', 'Pfeifer’s generic approach to French-leaning cuisine is what one wishes first-class airline fare always tasted like, which is to say vaguely fancy and well executed. You work your way through a roasted halibut over beans — a touch overcooked, but not dreadfully so — or pan-seared sweetbreads in a creamy blanquette sauce, the organ meats as silky and soft as fresh mozzarella. And then you continue on with your ogling of the cityscape. ', 'In one regard, such a setup is thoughtful; no one wants anything requiring a tableside “here’s how to eat this” speech while soaking up a once-in-a-lifetime vista. But in another sense, there’s something decidedly stodgy about the implicit premise of Manhatta, which is that diners up high almost exclusively want another safe breed of continental-American fare, another serving of flaky turbot with brown butter and capers. It’s an assumption that has governed the “dinner with a view” class for venues for decades, from the old Windows on the World to the Rainbow Room to the current offerings at One World Trade. And barring a people’s revolution, it’s an assumption that will likely inform the upcoming rooftop offerings at 70 Pine and 15 Hudson Yards.', 'One wonders: As observatories, by their nature, attract some of the city’s most international crowds, should they not diversify their offerings just a bit? Shouldn’t these tourist-drawing venues act as diplomats to the city’s multitudinous culinary offerings below? ', 'Alas, until that happens, Pfeifer does an impressive enough job with wagyu bavette steak, cross-hatching the top layer of beef to act as a sponge for a rich beef jus. He delivers a very good duck a l’orange, expertly rendering out the fats in the gently gamy breast. And he has a near work of art with his foie gras, a geometrically precise terrine over a layer of barely chewy tete de veau. It is a sweet-salty candy bar like few others. ', 'The meal winds down with desserts, perhaps a competent vanilla souffle or a requisitely sticky date cake. If this were an a la carte menu, you’d probably skip these sweets, but it’s not worth complaining much here; the prix fixe means spending a bit more time overlooking nocturnal Manhattan in its luminescent glory. And while the city doesn’t suffer from any shortage of good Gallic food, Meyer’s ability to make this space unusually accessible is a true gift to New York.', 'Cost: $78 for three courses in the main dining room or at the bar. A la carte is also available in the bar room, with most small plates under $20. A French onion soup burger is $28. All prices are service included — no tipping.', 'Sample dishes: Lobster quenelle with trumpet mushrooms, foie gras with tete de veau, duck a l’orange, wagyu bavette, warm date cake, vanilla souffle.', 'Bonus tip: If you go as a walk-in (which is likely, given how far in advance tables book up), try calling ahead to get a sense of the wait, or consider checking the social-media feeds to see if Manhatta is closed for a private event, which seems to be the case more frequently than at other establishments.']"
43,"['Empire builder Kihyun Lee’s rustic-chic Midtown restaurant is innovative and artful', 'The art project of a menu at Her Name is Han, at 28 pages, runs longer than most wine lists. The binder-bound tome opens to photos of of soju bathed in soft light. Pink grapefruit segments and candied cherry blossoms bob in the distilled spirit, a harbinger of the boozy night that will ensue. On another page, a shrimp and hot-pepper pancake is shot from overhead, an angle that flattens the jeon’s intensely briny and spicy nooks and crannies, almost giving it the illusion of being stenciled on its blue-and-white plate. ', 'All of the pages are matte, printed on heavy, high-quality paper, with the dishes and descriptions scattered about in a loose, magazine-style layout. Some items receive museum style-captions; there are short history lessons on the origins of gochugaru spice paste and army stews. Fanned-out slices of pig belly are advertised in all-caps fonts that would be fit for a wartime billboard. “HAN’S PORK WILL FATTEN YOUR SOUL!” ', 'None of this feels like a standard bill of fare as much as a gift guide from a high-end retailer. Owner Kihyun Lee, who studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology, is leveraging the power of print and design to transform the restaurant’s rustic Korean dishes into objects of edible desire.', 'Or put more practically, the menu’s clever photography acts as an unspoken guide to why certain dishes are so spectacular. Consider the bulgogi. The camera gets in close on the minced short-rib patty, the surface glistening with moisture, the craggy edges burnished from the grill. I daydreamed about the gorgeous char before it arrived — and when it did, on a scorching cast-iron pan, the bulgogi turned out to be perfectly seared, crunchy, and packed with notes of sugar, sesame, and soy. When I close my eyes and picture it, what I see first is the photo. ', 'As certain stretches of the city continue to suffer from strains of gastronomic ennui (“oh boy, another New American hotel restaurant”), the ascendency of modern Korean fare has become one of the more energizing trends in New York, from the tasting-menu-only Jungsik to the experimental small plates of Oiji to the ramyun wonders of Jeju to the bovine barbecue bombshell that is Cote. Lee himself helped fuel this zeitgeist with Take 31, which hawks Havana-style corn cakes, radish kimchi jambalaya, and banana-flavored rice beer (his hospitality company, HAND, also collaborates with the sleek Korean Atoboy).', 'The more classical Han doesn’t so much represent a refutation of this trend as a stylish counterpoint to it. The nearly three-year-old venue, next door to Take 31, elicits most of its thrills via more traditional means: homestyle shared plates, stews, and one of the city’s better fried chickens. This is all contrasted, gently, by that Ethan Allen catalogue of a menu, as well as the the requisite brick walls, neon signage, exposed filament light bulbs, antlers, and bric-a-brac on bookshelves. ', 'Then again, it is unlikely that notions of modernity, tradition, the color of the walls, or even the name of your dining companions will register as important data points when the fiery blue crab is wreaking havoc on your face, your tongue, your mucous membranes. Chef NamHyung Woo cuts up raw crab and douses it in enough garnet spice paste to make the crustacean look like a drippy Christmas ornament. The best way to eat the staple dish, called yangnyeom gejang, is however the heck you can, but this critic advises slurping the grey, slippery meat out of the shell and enjoying the gentle brininess before the full heat assault takes over (tamer types can scoop out the meat with a spoon). ', 'Pair the crab with cooling tofu. Han drenches the bean curd in so much black sesame seed sauce that it takes on the look of vanilla bean-speckled gelato. On top of this largesse goes a fistful of crisply battered onions. The flavors are simple and accessible: soft tofu, nutty milk, salty fried allium. On its own, it’s a solid-sized snack (or a light meal) for $9. ', 'Every dinner, of course, is accompanied by the traditional banchan, ramekin-sized side dishes that change on a daily basis, from cabbage kimchi to salted asparagus, umami-rich tangles of dried seaweed, and chewy little piles of dried, chile-flecked squid.', 'Han’s menu bills its offerings as “Korean soul food,” stating that the venue is geared toward the “growing number of Korean Americans and Korean internationals working and studying in the city.” ', 'Indeed, the greater metropolitan area is home to the country’s second-largest community of Korean Americans in the country after Los Angeles. And while many of the more modern spots are dispersed throughout Tribeca, the East Village, Flatiron, and elsewhere, Lee keeps his small empire closer to Manhattan’s Koreatown on 32nd street, where venues are often open 24 hours to cope with sky-high rents. ', 'Han closes at 11:15 p.m. on weekends, which is a bit of a letdown for those craving its superb fried chicken. It might not reach the level of perfection of, say, Turntable Jazz (one of the city’s best, open until midnight on the weekends), but it beats out virtually any recent entry this critic can think of. The bird lacks any of the garlic or chile sauces so frequently associated with Korean-style fries. It’s just plain fried chicken that’s sufficiently juicy, crispy, and brined, with a touch of sweetness, and a wallop of concentrated poultry flavor. The kitchen cuts it into knobs that can be picked up with chopsticks; the meat is best when sprinkled with a touch of salt and dipped into sweet-and-sour sauce.', 'The menu says that its rice cakes are laced with yuzu, but I couldn’t detect any of the fragrant citrus. They taste like any good rice cake: soft, glutinous, and slathered in chile sauce. Also consider the steamed dumplings, filled with pork and cabbage, as well as the stretchy potato noodles, infused with soy and topped with sweet head-on shrimp.', 'Bo ssam, boiled pork belly with spicy kimchi, won’t win any converts with its middle-of-the-road preparation; others will find comfort in the soft textures and bland flavors of the pork.', 'Budae jjigae, which literally boils from the heat of a tableside flame, is a stunning rendition of the post-Korean War stew, blending American ingredients like Spam, canned beans, hot dogs, and processed yellow cheese (which fully dissolves within seconds) with rice cakes and kimchi-infused beef broth. It’s a study in succulent, umami-rich nitrites that will require the user to consume as much water as beer. ', 'The desserts boast a more contemporary bent. The kitchen places two scoops of black sesame ice cream over a green tea crumble and garnishes the affair with tart dried strawberries; the primary-color contrasts are striking — the dish looks like it was pulled out a cartoon sundae shop. ', 'Even better is the deconstructed banana split: a bruleed sweet plantain, served alongside a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a spicy pool of caramel ginger.

44,"['Einat Admony’s charming West Village restaurant looks like a fast-casual restaurant but tastes like a fine dining one', 'With its nuanced use of precious spices and inspired flavor combinations, Moroccan cuisine is among the world’s tastiest. The country lies at the end of spice routes that span the Sahara, with a mixed population of Berbers and Arabs, but one that also had a substantial Sephardic Jewish population during the pre-Israel era. Additionally, the country was colonized by Spain and France. All these influences come into focus in a subtle and sometimes playful cuisine.', 'This and other North African cuisines are the centerpiece of the menu at Kish-Kash, which concentrates solely on one dish: couscous. The new restaurant from chef Einat Admony, who was born in Tel Aviv and also operates Balaboosta and Taim, opened in June on a shady stretch of Hudson Street in the West Village, between Morton and Barrow streets. Two welcoming benches sit out front.', 'Inside, an airy modern interior is lined with geometric tiles in grayish and greenish shades, reflecting Islamic design traditions, mixed with a certain Swedish flair to the prim and nicely padded furniture. No reservations are taken for smaller parties, the tables are closely spaced, and an open kitchen lies at the end of the room. The bill of fare is short, offering only four apps, three sides, and six versions of couscous, plus specials. While the atmosphere and limited focus suggest a fast-casual joint, the excellence of the food shouts “fine dining.” In fact, Kish-Kash feels like a new sort of hybrid.', 'Few dishes this year have landed with such a bang as Admony’s chicken tagine couscous. Let’s look first at the couscous itself, presented on the side rather than underneath. In many Moroccan restaurants, it arrives studded with lamb, chicken, and merguez, dubbed “royal couscous.” In truth, these couscouses are often dry as blown desert sand.', 'At Kish-Kash, the chef and her minions endlessly fuss over it, steaming and re-steaming. Despite the small size of the couscous she deploys — the couscous, which represents crushed durum wheat semolina, is available in dozens of diameters — the result is memorably moist, and not the least bit sloppy.', 'The implement she uses is known as a kish-kash, which consists of a pair of pots, one poised over the other. With the brilliant couscous produced therein, the main courses fall into place. Foremost is the aforementioned chicken tagine ($15), which pairs another famous Moroccan dish, a stew often cooked in a clay vessel called a tagine, with the couscous. A plump bird is roasted with green olives, preserved lemons, and caramelized onions, producing a winning pungency with a citric edge.', 'Another spectacular couscous is mafrum, a recipe often attributed to Libya that features a hollowed-out potato filled with spicy ground beef. The chef further tosses rankly potato sticks on top of the spud to add crunch. I could eat this spectacular comfort food every day. Equally good is chraime ($19), a fish fillet in a limpid tomato sauce crowned with pepper. The dish is hot but not too hot.', 'In the second tier of desirable couscous at Kish-Kash, but still well worth ordering, stand tbecha (short rib, on one occasion a bit tough), chunky lamb (simultaneously chewy and tender), and Moroccan vegetables of the squash, carrot, and turnip sort, shotgunned with chickpeas. For once, the dish didn’t seem like a torture arranged for vegetarians, and I’d gladly order this again, especially considering the $12 price tag.', 'Speaking of vegetables, they totally rule the rest of the menu. There’s a great hummus ($9) flavored with chermoula, a green relish of chopped parsley and cilantro and presented with seeded challah bread, which arrives in a paper bag with the edges turned back. No cardboard pitas here. There’s also a cauliflower smothered in tahini, a brilliant salad featuring greens and sliced avocado in a lemony dressing, and deep fried eggplant.', 'Another charming aspect of the menu is the three sides, priced at $3 each: a crushed and brightly flavored orange squash, stewed tomatoes, and lemon-pickled vegetables. Individually or in concert, they add extra zing to your plate of couscous.', 'Several things make Kish-Kash particularly appealing. One is the couscous itself, rendered more perfectly than in any other New York establishment; I’ve only tasted couscous this good in Morocco. Second, the limited menu encourages you to zone in on your favorite version of the dish and make it your regular order. Alternately, if you happen to be there with a table of friends, it’s well within the realm of reason to order all the starters and all the sides to enjoy a sumptuous banquet.', 'And with its small size, cheery demeanor, commendable service, and relatively low prices (one can dine well for $25), Kish-Kash feels like a new type of restaurant, hopefully spawning imitators who strike a similar note with different cuisines. A Mexican restaurant concentrating on ceviche prepared with the precision of sushi, or a Chinese cocktail bar concentrating on Shanghai tapas? Well, why not? Let’s call it “slow casual.”', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including an app, two couscouses, two side dishes, and two glasses of mint tea, plus tax but not tip, $70', 'Sample dishes: baladi eggplant with roasted red pepper tahini, shuk salad with avocado, mafrum (stuffed potato) couscous, chirchi mashed squash', 'What to drink: Nothing is more refreshing than the mint iced tea ($5), but the house sangria ($12) of fresh peaches and rosewater is also a good choice. Apart from that, a short wine list, and a better selection of beer await your choice.', 'Bonus tip: One dessert is usually available. On a recent occasion, it was basbousa, a semolina cake with fresh berries. Share it with the table.', '']"
45,"['Anthony Mangieri’s once-supreme pies have lost some of their luster, especially at $25 apiece', 'When Andrea Clurfeld of the Asbury Park Press reviewed a small Jersey Shore restaurant in 1997, she used the type of exuberant yet technical language one might associate with a French fine dining palace. Except this was a humble pie joint — Una Pizza Napoletana. The baker was Anthony Mangieri. The ingredients were imported from Italy. And the recipe for the naturally leavened dough was “handed down by the gods,” Clurfeld wrote.', 'Mangieri, alas, would shutter his first pizzeria. He relocated to the East Village in 2004, at a time when the city’s top pizzerias were Brooklyn stalwarts known less for showcasing top-tier products and more for following their own traditions. But the crowds came to Una, paying $17 for the margherita. In 2009 Times critic Frank Bruni called the cherry tomato pizza the city’s best — less than two weeks before Una 2.0 unexpectedly served its final pies. Mangieri was moving Una again, this time to San Francisco. His priest performed mass at the restaurant on opening night. He initially charged $20 for his creations, eventually upping the price to $25. When he closed it last year to move back to New York, local food writers penned eulogies whose tones suggested the premature death of a beloved humanitarian.', 'It’s hard to think of any extant pizzaiolo, other than Chris Bianco, who has been the subject of such critical praise over the past two decades. And it’s almost impossible to think of a single other American chef who, instead of building a small empire, has chosen to live the life of a solo craftsman, closing his successful restaurants whenever he moves. This is what brings us to the Lower East Side, where Mangieri has partnered with chefs and restaurateurs Fabian von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone to open Una 4.0. It’s with a nod toward statistical probability, rather than cynicism, that one supposes it might not last forever. ', 'And it’s with a nod toward reality that one realizes his pies aren’t as good as they should be, not at $25 apiece, and not in the crowded, experimental, ingredient-obsessed, regionally focused pizza biosphere that is contemporary New York.', 'Una’s new digs suggest a futuristic diner crossed with a place of worship. There are stark white walls, black floor tiles, bare brown tabletops, emerald green chairs that fall over easily if you lean back, gray screens arranged in Mondrian-like patterns, and a pizza oven spitting fire from behind a glass partition. How sepulchral. Mangieri stands behind that partition, making pies. Patrons watch as he molds the dough, applies the toppings, and pours olive oil from a copper cruet. He uses a metal peel to methodically rotate the pies in his oven, momentarily lifting them (to even out the cooking) before extricating them from the flames. ', 'His movements are efficient, elegant, hypnotic. And his bread is without equal among the city’s Neapolitan spots. The pie’s outer rim is as fluffy as a fresh doughnut, releasing steam when torn. The crust is only gently blistered, with a subtle sourdough tang. It’s the stuff Mangieri puts on top of that pie — subpar imported mozzarella, too much parsley, uneven salt — that often make the main event a letdown, however. Such an oversight would’ve been a problem of critical proportions under any other variant of Una, where only the only items up for grabs were Mangieri’s four or five pies, plus beer or wine.', 'But Una 4.0 spreads its risk, boasting a slightly longer menu that bookends the baking with starters and sweets. If one were to rank things, the chief reasons to visit are, in this order: the ice cream, the tiramisu, the small plates, the natural wines, the three tomato pizza, the marinara pie, the cherry tomato pie, the air conditioning, and then the margherita, which you can quite frankly skip. This Lower East Side spot, in other words, generally functions better as a modern Von Hauske and Stone restaurant than a classically minded Mangieri joint. ', 'Ice cream is among the chief summertime draws of any tristate pizza parlor, and so it’s worth noting that Von Hauske’s are among the city’s most electric. For the plain vanilla variety, he laces the dessert with a sucker punch of sodium, leaving an aftertaste that recalls the salty milk at the bottom of a bowl of corn flakes. For pistachio, he uses a Turkish paste that balances the product’s deep nuttiness with its heady perfume. And for all his ice creams, he builds his bases without egg, spinning equal parts cream and milk from Five Acre farms, resulting in a dairy drop kick so concentrated it almost tastes malted. ', 'One wouldn’t be faulted for dropping by Una for just for dessert — any dessert. Von Hauske brings life to the tired staple that is panna cotta by decorating it like a birthday cake, garnishing the outer rim with a fragrant ring of strawberries that have been sliced, whipped, and juiced. He also serves a rum- and Cynar-laced tiramisu, dense with ladyfingers and mascarpone, in a chalice, giving this kingly and complex confection the regal serving device it deserves. ', 'Starters, compliments of Stone, are equally destination-worthy, even if they’re more in loose conversation with the concept of a pizzeria than a kowtow to the form. The chef cuts raw filet mignon into thick strips and showers them in olives, pistachios, and a carbonara’s worth of parmesan. He uses ceci not in a chickpea salad, but rather to surround a circle of yuzukosho-spiked raw lobster, a wickedly delicious tartare. To channel pepperoni, he spreads spicy ’nduja sausage on a plate, topping it off with rounds of watery turnip and peppery nasturtium leaves; the effect evokes an edible version of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract circles. ', 'Some will find such appetizer experimentalism to be incongruous with traditional pizzas. I’d counter that it’s a valiant study in how refinement and rusticity, artistry and craft, deserve to coexist. Why? Because when I’m swigging back a honeyed Tokaji or frothy lambrusco, the fact that these small plates seem to belong to a separate restaurant take a back seat to a more important reality: They’re delicious. ', 'If only Mangieri’s pizzas — particularly the toppings — were as reliably delicious as those at Razza, Roberta’s, Sullivan Street, and so many other spots that charge $7-$12 less. Una’s filetti pie, to be fair, is still impressive, with the gorgeously pulpy cherry tomatoes acting as foil to a pile of (not terribly milky) buffalo mozzarella. The margherita, somewhat creamy on certain nights, can suffer from curds as flavorless as Polly-O string cheese on other evenings; Mangieri occasionally uses cheese so low in moisture its tastes like saline rubber. ', 'His marinara pie is more smartly composed, with a layer of fragrant garlic and olive oil yielding to the gentle fragrance of San Marzanos. The fruit doesn’t boast the compelling acidity or assertive aroma found in comparable pies around town; this is a more restrained study in the tomatoes’ complexity. Sometimes this is maddening; you often need to close your eyes and concentrate to divine the nature of these tomatoes. And sometimes, for just a bite or two, it all comes together; the pulp mixes with a salt crystal, resulting in a concoction as aromatic as rose.', 'Then on another night the marinara is underseasoned. So you ask for salt. A waiter shakes his head. This decision, for a nanosecond, is understandable. One wouldn’t walk into an opera house and tell the soprano to sing louder — but there’s something to be said for using a hearing aid. For some, salt is that hearing aid for flavor. Even at the city’s most expensive sushi parlors, chefs often give diners a tiny ramekin of shoyu, just in case. It’s a nice act of humility, and a comparable gesture at Una would go a long way given that dinner for one (a starter, a pizza, a dessert, two drinks) can run nearly $100 after tax and tip. ', 'The right move is to swing by on Fridays for the new “Concetta” pizza. Mangieri blends house-made tomato paste, roasted tomatoes, crushed San Marzanos, and pecorino. It’s an epic ode to the classic New York-style tomato pie. The flavors and textures are alternatingly jammy, tart, sugary, pulpy, umami-rich, and floral — at least that’s the case if you pick off the forest canopy’s worth of parsley, an herb whose bitterness overwhelms the tomato’s subtleties.', 'Pizza-making is tough, manual labor. Diners who click on the “about” section of Una’s website will encounter an article about Mangieri discussing the mental stress of the job and the toll of inhaling flour and smoke. For these sacrifices we should all be paying more. But it would help Mangieri’s case for higher prices if he were making better pizza.', 'Cost: Starters at $9-$20; pizzas at $25; desserts at $7-$9. Expect to spend about $100 per person on dinner after tax and tip for a full three-course meal with drinks.', 'Sample Dishes: Raw beef with olives and pistachios, raw lobster with yuzukosho and chickpeas, ’nduja with turnip and nasturtium, margherita pizza, marinara pizza, three-tomato pizza, cherry tomato pizza, tiramisu, panna cotta, pistachio ice cream.', 'Bonus Tip: The chief reasons to come here are the small plates, the desserts, and the natural wines. For pizza, Friday is your best bet for the three-tomato pie.']"
46,"['Creative comfort food, warm hospitality, and complimentary cheese balls delight at the Prospect Heights newcomer', 'MeMe’s Diner in Prospect Heights was empty at 10 p.m. on a recent Thursday. I walked in, took a seat at the counter, and grinned as a waiter placed a saucer of cheeseballs in front of me. This was not an artisanal product but an industrial one — neon corn puffs enrobed in dehydrated cheddar. Their bright orange hue took on the air of bioluminescence against the Christmas-green bar stools. I ate the puffs in between sips of passion fruit-laced milk punch; when I finished them the waiter asked if I’d like more. This transaction occurred in less time than it typically takes to get $7 bread service at a more upscale establishment. The cheeseballs were free. ', 'There were three staffers in the restaurant that night: the waiter, co-owner Bill Clark, who worked the front of the house, and co-owner Libby Willis, who oversaw the kitchen alone. Willis sent out my coconut-crusted sweet potato atop a pool of salsa verde and mole poblano, the sugary starch acting as a counterpoint to the tart, nutty, fiery sauces. I paired the dish with the restaurant’s signature Manhattan, a cocktail that Clark’s grandmother reportedly drinks every day. It was a big Manhattan.', 'Amid the quiet room I wondered if I was inside a modern, boozy version of Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, the 1942 painting that depicted a sparsely populated Greenwich Village diner as a beacon on a dark city street. Then other patrons started showing up, and I was no longer alone, though really, I never was. ', 'The fact that MeMe’s is a newly opened diner — not to mention a queer-owned business with a largely queer and diverse staff — makes it an outlier of sorts, even if the term “diner” is loosely applied. A diner, after all, is supposed to serve lunch and breakfast; MeMe’s does not. And a diner is supposed to be old, which doesn’t say much for the future of the form. A Crain’s article from 2015 suggests the number of these establishments have dropped by nearly 60 percent over the past 25 years. The reasons are similar to why other small-time operators have been closing: The cost of business is going up as rents and labor costs continue to rise.', 'This reality is even tougher for a diner. Patrons expect longer hours, lower check averages, a patty melt that never changes, and epically lengthy menus, all in a venue where they can sit and read the newspaper for an hour and get free refills. And therein lies the paradox. Everything that allows independent restaurants to adapt to the city’s brutal restaurant economy, from seasonal menu innovations, to performative sourcing (organic this, fair trade that) to never-ending price hikes, goes against the very nature of what a diner is supposed to be: a stable respite from our brutally mutating capitalist world. ', 'Channeling the ethos of a diner, in other words, comes with handcuffs that are both financial and nostalgic. Willis and Clark succeed by playing by some of the rules; there are the lowish prices, the giant dinner portions. And then they bend some of the others, as with their freewheeling approach to comfort fare, which ranges from deliciously dorm room-y (potato chip-crusted mac and cheese with hot sauce) to healthfully voguish (quinoa, millet, and amaranth porridge). ', 'The setting, incidentally, is a 31-seat room boasting a teal-and-brown bar, a letterboard cocktail menu, bucket stools, frosted cake under a glass cloche, and tan leather benches. MeMe’s isn’t so much a utilitarian cafeteria as it is a rosy-eyed reanimation of a midcentury lunch counter. I can’t think of another restaurant with a Shirley Temple on the beverage list.', 'This is precisely the place to order a patty melt. The burger, smashed between two slices of griddled marble rye, packs a deep maillard char, and drips with American cheese and Russian dressing. On the side is a pile of potatoes as crispy and heady as anything out of a Michelin-starred French brasserie. This costs just $17. ', 'Affordability is key. One can enjoy a giant egg sandwich, stacked with cheese and greens, for just eight bucks. A more composed brunch or dinner, with a beer, tax, and tip, will run about $30. To be fair, those aren’t price levels that one might deem “diner cheap.” And accessibility isn’t the term that comes to mind when one hears of 90-minute waits during peak brunch.', 'Related: Brunch is excellent. On a Sunday afternoon the restaurant was filled with people wearing dresses, graphic T-shirts, babies, hijabs, designer trucker caps, and statement necklaces. There are no free cheeseballs at brunch. There are free bowls of dry cereal instead, a mix of Lucky Charms, Froot Loops, Trix, and Golden Grahams. The cereal contains no milk or kitschy refinement, though it’s hard not to overlook the fact that the bespoke selection appears to have been coordinated with the restaurant’s own faded color scheme. The wait staff is happy to bring seconds. ', 'Willis and Clark base their approach to American comfort fare on a mix of “international pantry staples” (chile oil, fish sauce), “farmer’s market greens,” and “bodega standards,” to use their words. The cereal clearly belongs in the bodega camp. So do the migas — soft-scrambled eggs with cilantro served in a bag of Fritos. As the chipotle cream and green salsa absorbs into the corn chips, they soften into a glorious, fork pierce-able mush. Pair this with a few slices of Maldon-flecked cinnamon toast.', 'Just as stunning — and photogenic — are the fried eggs, served sunny side up on a bed of wilted kale. Willis surrounds them with a tidy moat of chile oil, the shallow pool filled with pepitas, sunflower seed, and poppy seeds. The flavor is gentle at first, complexly nutty, crunchy, and smoldering. And then pepper-laced greens assault the palate with a stinging uppercut of heat. ', 'In the evenings, the right way to kick off a meal is with the fried giardiniera, a fritto misto improved by the acidic tang of pickled carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers. Griddled meatballs, in turn, are doused in an intoxicating char siu-style mix of cinnamon, garlic, and hoisin. You retrieve them out of a ceramic crock with wooden toothpicks.', 'For mains, consider the patty melt or sweet potato. The suburban mall-style Buffalo chicken salad is everything it claims to be, a bed of blue cheese-studded lettuce below a pile of crispy hot sauce-slicked fowl. The cordon bleu, in turn, is a study in satiating caloric expectations; it’s a thick slab of pan-fried breast meat in a robe of salty ham and Gruyere.', 'Those who drop by a touch earlier or later will find patrons using MeMe’s like they would a traditional diner, which is to say at a more leisurely pace, with no waits at all. I watched as one guest sat and sketched in a notebook before sunset. Another couple came in for dessert just before 11 p.m. Their reward was a slice of Vietnamese iced coffee cake, simultaneously sweet, bitter, and fluffy.', 'Servers present each check with a mint-chocolate Andes Candy. They say thank you, and that’s it. They don’t say “Thanks guys” or “Come back again, ladies.” It’s part of the gender-neutral ethos; common phrases like “yes sir” or “yes ma’am,” whose incorrect usage can ruin someone’s meal, are never uttered here.', 'It’s no small matter that these policies are being implemented at a venue that serves as a proverbial third place between work and home. In an era when incidents at coffee chains, breakfast chains, late-night bars, and bakeries are making more Americans question whether so-called everyday spaces are truly welcome to all, and in an era when queer spaces in the hospitality industry are gradually vanishing, society could use more places like MeMe’s — places where inclusivity and diversity aren’t a reactionary PR scheme, but rather part of the institution’s DNA. ', 'The fact that it serves one of the city’s best brunches doesn’t hurt either; the opening of the back garden in warmer weather should help with the waits just a touch. And even though MeMe’s is a chic diner where the coffee costs $4, refills are still free.', 'Cost: Starters at $10 or less; mains at $20 or less. Desserts are $8. Nothing is more than $17 at brunch.

It’s helmed by Gino Sorbillo, as famous for his campaign against organized crime as for his pizza. He has gladly donned the mantle of celebrity chef and sashayed into the East Village wearing it for a few days before departing and leaving his brother Toto in charge. After a brief tenure and a few photo opps, Toto left too.', 'Still, even after their departure, a reminder of Sorbillo’s Italian celebrity remains in the East Village space. The expansive, well-lit interior has graphic texts in Italian along the walls, including a stenciled slogan “La Pizza Fa Miracoli” (or “pizza makes miracles”). Near the rear of the room, portraits of a bespectacled Sorbillo stare down from the walls like Big Brother. As for the supposedly celebrity-level pizzas, sure, you can get a great pie at Sorbillo — but only if you stick to the cheaper ones. ', 'Flying from the wood-burning beehive oven at the end of the room, the pizzas are of the classic Naples variety. Large enough to satisfy one person, they sport an airy, bulbous crust speckled with spots of char, and a fine texture that results from the imported flour used. The lower-cost pies revel in this simplicity, using mainly canned San Marzano tomatoes, domestic and imported mozzarella, and a drizzle of flavorful olive oil. Consistent with the genre, these pies are limp and damp in the middle, so you may have to pick up a knife and fork to eat them. ', 'Pizzas like the antica margherita ($17) are spectacular in their nuanced blandness. (Better not to think about the price of a similar pie in Naples, which is often less than half.) The vecchia Roma ($18), also worth the money, boasts shavings of uncured guanciale (hog jowl) in addition to Rome’s signature cheese, pecorino, which gives the pie a salty savor. ', 'This is brilliant pizza formulation, on a menu that confers themes inspired by Italian regions on most of its 15 pies. My favorite of all, Nduja ($22) is associated with Calabria, the toe of Italy’s boot. Across its surface lie little splotches of liquid salami, with rings of purple onion strewn around like hula hoops. The calzone’s worth ordering too, a Neapolitan specialty that wraps the same dough around a filling of ricotta, mozzarella, and salami, propelled by black pepper, making a meal of incredible richness. ', 'But some of the more expensive pies are terrible. One evening, a friend and I tested pizzas topped with porcini mushrooms and black truffles (the Firenze and the Alba, respectively priced at $30 and $35). The mushrooms were sodden and slippery, and the truffles lumpy with no delicacy of flavor; both tasted canned. Heck, if you have a fresh truffle, it’s not a bad idea to put it on a cheese pizza, but you must shave it on at the last minute.', 'The three Sorbillo branches in Naples mainly offer pizzas with a handful of starters, but when the idea of a New York branch was being hatched, someone had the bright idea that the place should be a full-blown Italian restaurant, too. This was a big mistake, leading the pizzas to almost seem like an afterthought on a tediously long menu. Let’s visit the other sections one by one.', 'First, there are the pastas, which tend to taste like something thrown together from leftovers. Pasta e piselli ($19) features tubettini, like stunted rigatoni, tossed with peas and bacon, but deriving little smoky benefit from the bacon. And the peas taste exceedingly tired. Nobody told the recipe developer that Americans don’t much like small, stale peas in their pasta.', 'Similarly, the gnocchi alla Sorrentina, named after a town on a peninsula south of Naples that extends toward the Isle of Capri, are mushy and dull tasting. Worst of all is Genovese — big pasta tubes called paccheri in an oniony sludge too sweet by a mile, nothing like what the menu’s descriptor of “ragu” suggests. Why even put them on the menu; who expects pizzaioli to make good pasta, anyway?', 'Not surprisingly, the apps mainly fail as well, including an adamantine version of fried calamari bested by nearly every bar in town, and salads that are mainly a heap of dry arugula and a few tomatoes that arrive entirely undressed. Yes, good olive oil and a so-so bottle of balsamic appear on the side, but really this is just the beginning of an acceptable dressing.', 'Then there’s a starter that consists of an unadorned lump of mozzarella and a pile of flavorless mushrooms without as much as a shake of salt. Overpriced at $21, it was as if someone proclaimed, “Dig up some apps that won’t take us a bit of trouble to make and charge plenty for them.”', 'But among the meat and contorni sections are at least a couple of gems. In the latter category, the sautéed escarole accented with black olives and capers is the soul of southern Italian cooking, and the same vegetable served with grilled sausage is similarly delicious, though at $21 for a single split sausage, it doesn’t really reflect the generosity and abundance of the cuisine.', 'At Sorbillo Pizzeria, one is wise to stick with the cheaper pizzas.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one app or salad, one pizza, a pasta, and a bottle of wine, including tax but not tip, $110', 'Sample dishes: Antica margherita pizza, calzone Napoletano, salsicca e escarole (sausage and escarole)\xa0 ', 'What to drink: While quirky, the wine list at Sorbillo is great and reasonably priced. Any bottle from Feudi San Gregorio is highly recommended, and at $30, their red Rubrato is a steal. On the other hand, most pizza eaters in Naples stick with beer or Coca-Cola.', 'Bonus tip: Given the excellence of the wine list and the simpler pies, you might just treat this place as a wine bar; a bottle of wine and a pizza shared between two can be less than $50.']"
48,"['I’m not sure the man in a velvet maroon blazer who greeted us at the front door of Bar Crenn was French, but it doesn’t matter — he had me at “Bonjour.” Somewhere else, his affectation might’ve come off as forced or kitschy — like, “Hello, Americans: Welcome to a French restaurant.” ', 'Not here. This opulent, dimly lit den is star chef Dominque Crenn’s, the Marina’s splashiest new spot since her first born, Atelier Crenn, opened next door in 2011. Crenn is one of America’s only multi-Michelin-starred female chef (Chef Suzette Gresham also maintains two at Acquerello). Nothing she does is kitschy: not the white, faux-fur-draped chaise or the chandeliers dripping crystal or the leopard-print thrones or the intentionally distressed books lining the shelves or the ginormous painting of a Coco Chanel lookalike presiding over our plates. It all could have felt gaudy or overwrought, but with Crenn’s touch, the sum total was tasteful, impeccably done. Bar Crenn is the most romantic place to sit and sip a pamplemousse negroni — and slurp Guy Savoy’s ice-poached oyster in its own gelee — in all of San Francisco.  ', 'And the most expensive: Bar Crenn was billed as a wine bar, but that’s a bit of a misnomer. If you want a table, you’ve got to buy a ticket through Tock: That’ll be $165 per person for the caviar tasting, $85 per person for the three-course “carte blanche” menu, or $50 per person for wine with “small bites.” If I’m going to spend at least $200 for two, I’m going to call it dinner. The only way to make this place affordable is to pop by for a glass (standing room only) or forgo all booze and order nothing but the brioche. Which, being a buttery, golden masterpiece of a mini loaf, would still be worth it. ', 'As Crenn told Eater earlier, Bar Crenn’s design is intended to make us feel like we’re hanging out in her living room. (Her house must be pretty nice.) It’s not unlike George Chen’s aim for his elegant, “private chateau” Eight Tables or the couch-strewn vibe at SF Jazz’s newish B-Side lounge.', 'I’m down with living room-like dining. I don’t mind sinking into a cushy armchair or hunching over a coffee table. But to be fair, I usually do it while eating delivery pizza in front of Netflix, not cutting into a dainty pancetta-studded tarte flambee donated by Alain Ducasse. (Jews are supposed to recline on Passover, so why not on a Saturday night at a 1930s-style Parisian salon, too?)', 'Glancing around Bar Crenn’s long, narrow room, though, it was clear not everyone felt so comfortable. There was the trio squeezed side by side on a loveseat, facing out rather than toward each other, TV sitcom-style. The silver-haired foursome (men in sports jackets, ladies in pearls) shifting in their deep, velvet cushions, trying their best to make out the menu’s 10-point font in the dark. (“It sets a mood,” said our server. “But…”)', 'The flirty, well-heeled couples sitting knee to knee at the marble-topped bar were content. As were my sister and I, sliding into our mismatched settees, feeling chicer than we actually are — until we also felt something I hate feeling in a restaurant: cold. Seated beneath a ceiling vent blasting frigid air, it was like Siberia suddenly invaded France. We couldn’t switch because every one of the 26 seats was reserved or occupied; requests to make it warmer resulted in a warm stuffiness that we all agreed was worse. So, soigne Siberia it was. I thought about wrapping myself in the white faux-fur throw draped behind me, but realized that would’ve probably been frowned upon.  ', 'After all, Bar Crenn is civilized and sophisticated, a welcome detour off otherwise fratty, fleece-clad Chestnut Street. The kind of place where a hollowed eggshell arrives brimming with bone-marrow custard, smoky creme fraiche, a squeeze of Meyer lemon, and an abundance of sturgeon caviar on a silver pedestal; and Dungeness crab comes delicately sandwiched between slabs of creamy avocado, dotted with Marcona almonds and purple nasturtium.', 'Meanwhile, one pink scallop, recently pulled from the Puget Sound, curls up inside a seashell with horseradish-spiked creme fraiche, a few pearls of caviar, and a $20 price tag. And finally, an eggy salmon souffle baked with a layer of black cod and accompanied by a sweet tomato compote arrives so fluffy and fleshy and flavorful — yet it’s finis after four or five forkfuls and left us craving more.', 'Which is to say, at Bar Crenn, the portions are small, the prices are high, and midway through the carte blanche tasting, you start to worry that despite blowing big bucks, you might leave on a still-empty stomach. ', 'Hence, my sister: “Another round of scallops!” she said to our server with gusto, without realizing that’d mean another $40 on our tab. We opted for seconds of the $5 oysters instead.', 'We also opted for the wine pairing. It was lovely — particularly the rare Loire Valley Sancerre — but it, too, wasn’t enough. Call me a wino, but for $65 I wanted more than the allotted three half-glasses spread across our almost three-hour supper. Or maybe it was just that the pacing was off; the Sancerre was poured long before our salmon souffle arrived. I took my first bite with my last sip. It would’ve been nice if our server had noticed and offered a splash more. At these prices, in this heady atmosphere, it would have been appropriate.', '\n    Related\n  ', 'But Dominique Crenn doesn’t need to give anything away. In some circles, she has become as much a legend as the living French chefs to whom she pays homage. For a taste of her artistry — whether at Bar Crenn, adjacent Atelier Crenn, or Petit Crenn on Hayes Street — people happily pay. Even swoon in her presence. “Everyone forgets how to eat when she comes in,” our server said. And she’s in often. “I’ve been working for her for years, and she still has the same effect on me.” ', 'Personally, watching Crenn, rock star that she is, chitchatting at the bar, I didn’t forget how to eat — I just wished I could keep eating. ', 'My earlier fear about not getting enough food? Confirmed — even after we enjoyed every last morsel. (Everything except for the quenelle Lyonnaise, that is. Its twin mounds of fish mousseline were squishy and airy and doused in a too-fishy crayfish sauce. It all tasted like a failed French attempt at Gefilte fish.) Even after spreading more whipped beef fat onto my brioche than any respectable human being should. Even after devouring the most divine Madeleine of my life — bronzed and buttery, made with almond flour, filled with lemon curd, bursting with Sicilian pistachios, and served less than 60 seconds after leaving the oven — I was out hundreds of dollars and still hungry. No matter how enchanting an evening, that’s never a good feeling. Or maybe it’s just the American in me. ', 'What it costs: A lot. Don’t expect to go carte blanche and get out of there for less than $200 for two. A la carte makes it more affordable, but you’ll likely want to follow it up with a burger.', 'What to drink: The pamplemousse negroni; wines by the glass are an intriguing, biodynamic mix from France and California, priced from $15 to $44.

49,"['The sleek new Prospect Heights restaurant delivers on Iranian flavors with a stunningly complex saffron rice, but service and other dishes are still uneven', 'When rice was primarily a staple, “a stomach filler, a vehicle for other foods,” it was, and often still is, “simply cooked by steaming,” author Najmieh Batmanglij writes in her excellent A Taste of Persia. But as modern cultivation methods developed over the centuries “the grain itself became a luxury,” she states, stressing that this was the case in Iran, as in Asia. Her geographic comparison is an astute one. The most expensive rice is generally sushi rice; aficionados tend to comment on its vinegar and temperature levels as if they were praying to a first-growth Bordeaux. But during whatever little discussion there is about Iranian cuisine in New York, rice itself is rarely mentioned as the complex indulgence it can be. ', 'The process of making saffron rice can involve rinsing the grains up to five times, parboiling them, steaming them, and gently scorching the bottom layer to form a nutty, golden crust called tahdig.', 'It’s a recipe whose steps are as precise as those of a more heralded paella or risotto. And when made correctly, as it often is at Sofreh, a modern Persian spot in Prospect Heights, it is as worthy of anything that an omakase chef anoints with tuna belly as part of a $250 tasting. ', 'The rice is firm, almost al dente. Like a mound of good caviar, the grains roll around on the tongue separately, without clumping. The dish smells richly of butter. On the palate, the flavor starts as vaguely sweet, and is then followed by the unmistakable pungency of saffron. It is not difficult to find decent saffron rice at the city’s kebab-heavy Persian spots; it mostly comes free as a side dish. At the skewer-free Sofreh, by contrast, this masterful version justifiably carries a separate charge, steakhouse style. Even next to gently griddled patties of ground beef in a pomegranate sauce, the strikingly nuanced rice steals the show.', 'Sofreh is an ode to the multitudinous flavors of Iran, from fruit-studded meat plates to sour ash soups to its use of rose in everything. It is also very much a work in progress. Food shows up before drink orders are taken. Drink orders take ages to arrive. Crumbs and errant splotches of mint-oil-infused eggplant puree (pretty delicious stuff) can sit on the table for uncomfortably long periods of time before things are wiped clean. Tahdig, sold separately from the saffron rice (as is the norm), exhibits the texture of a plastic toy.', 'And poorly cooked meat dishes leave the kitchen more frequently than they should; I’m thinking of a sad gray lamb shank and arid beef meatballs that tasted like they died under a heat lamp.', 'But then you take a bite of dill- and cilantro-studded rice, and Sofreh’s problems seem to fade away. You’re willing to look past the inconveniences when you tear off a ragged, sesame-studded chunk of sourdough tabrizi and dunk it into what looks like a bland, monochromatic yogurt sauce. That puckery dairy hides a dose of refreshment in the form of diced cucumbers — a typical pairing at local Iranian restaurants — and a less common squish of sweetness from a fistful of plump golden raisins, an addition that’s common in the chef’s native Isfahan.', 'The chef-owner in question is Nasim Alikhani. She ended her law studies at Tehran University in the years that followed the Islamic Revolution, leaving for the States in 1983. In the New York decades that followed, she worked as a nanny, cooked for Persian families, catered, opened and sold a printing business, went back to school, and, during the six years it took to ready Sofreh (briefly: Landmark regulations got in the way), attended culinary school and traveled throughout Iran.', 'Pulpy 1970s movies posters in the restroom.', 'Designing the restaurant was a tripartite effort with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, and art director Rozhia Tabnak, whom Alikhani described as “like a niece” during a phone interview. The family-like collaboration yielded an unmistakably sleek venue: Gray tables, walnut chairs, calligraphy carved into the walls, a bathroom plastered with pulpy Iranian movie posters from the 1970s, and swooping arches in the bar area that recall the great Safavid architecture of the 15th century. The stark white bar acts as a stunning background for a bright rose fizz, a pink-hued highball that transforms gin, lemon, cream, and egg white into pure, fragrant, effervescent froth. It is a fine accompaniment to a relish of pitted olives, a mind-bender of a starter wherein the briny vegetable is tamed through a sweet slick of pomegranate molasses and a crumble of soft walnuts. ', 'New Iranian restaurants in New York are a rarity, a reality that won’t be helped by President Trump’s travel ban, which indefinitely prohibits the issuance of immigrant or non-immigrant visas to citizens of the Islamic Republic.', 'And while New York boasts the country’s second-biggest population of Iranians behind Los Angeles — where the diaspora is the largest outside of Iran — most local Persian spots tend to serve reasonably uniform, kebab-laden menus, often in stodgy white-tablecloth settings. This older class of venues, from Persepolis to Ravagh, ranks with with classic steakhouses and Korean barbecue spots as some of the best places to eat meat in New York.', 'New York, however, lacks the pulsating diversity of LA’s Iranian community, packed with cafes, sandwich shops, bakeries, ice cream parlors, and even a Persian pizzeria. In this regard, Sofreh’s more contemporary cooking — and bare tabletops — functions as a compelling change of pace. Alikhani’s cooking also serves as a vital counterpoint to the city’s larger Middle Eastern culinary scene, where the diverse foodways of the Muslim majority region are often filtered through the lenses of Israeli-born chefs like Einat Admony, Meir Adoni, and Eyal Shani.', 'Alikhani stands poised to help local Iranian food evolve. She says her dishes are elegant takes on traditional homestyle preparations rather than, say, riffs on what’s coming out of the kitchens at Tehran’s more cutting edge-restaurants. ', 'For example: She prefers not to fully immerse meats or fish in liquid, as is common in Persian cooking. Instead, she slowly cooks a melange of plum, saffron, and barberries by themselves, preparing the chicken separately, on the griddle a la minute. The result is a supremely crispy and flavorful bird, with a sauce underneath that bursts with muted sweetness. She does the same for halibut, letting the pan-seared fish speak for itself, New American-style, atop a puree of onions, herbs, and tamarind. The mixture vibrates with a type of sourness that is quintessentially Iranian and straight up Wildair.  ', 'If rice is where Sofreh (usually) excels, desserts are where it dominates; its saffron ice cream is simply smoother than elsewhere. Its yogurt parfait, topped with a neon orange-carrot jam, could easily take on spendier versions at fashionable breakfast spots around town. Its puckery faloodeh, icy vermicelli with rosewater and lemon sorbet, lacks the cloying sweetness that brings down this affair at other restaurants. And a pale white-rice custard packs a wonderfully coarse, horchata-like texture to convey the lemon-tinged flavor of cardamom.', 'Sofreh, despite its flaws, is a vital addition to this year’s already strong crop of new restaurants.', 'Cost: Starters at $14 or less, with all but one main (the spicy fish) under $30. Desserts are $8. Sofreh is a touch more expensive than other Persian spots, but is priced on par with most contemporary New York restaurants.', 'Sample dishes: Grilled eggplant with caramelized onions, yogurt, and mint oil; cucumber yogurt dip with raisins; ash herb and noodle stew; half chicken with plum and saffron sauce; halibut with herb and tamarind sauce; saffron ice cream; rose custard with pistachio.', 'Bonus tip: Those who enjoy Sofreh really should consider the city’s other fine Persian spots, including Ravagh and Persepolis, two venues that are distinctly less crowded (if less hip).

50,"['In Brooklyn, two West Indian restaurants are cementing their statuses as New York meat destinations', 'You will wait at Peppa’s Jerk Chicken. This is not a criticism of the capable staffers, who briskly take orders, wrap festival fry bread in wax paper, rag on one another, speak in calm voices to customers who spew expletives about the wait (wasn’t me), strategically turn chicken thighs on the fire-spitting grills, and hack the finished birds with a shiny meat cleaver, all with an easygoing efficiency. The wait is a product of a simpler fact. People like the chicken at this Crown Heights counter-service spot. Lots of people. ', 'So you wait too. You listen to the reggae-tinged playlist. You place your order. And you snag one of two tables outside or one of six seats seats inside. Five to 15 minutes later, a counter worker presents you with an aluminum container filled with haphazardly chopped poultry parts. You squeeze Scotch bonnet sauce all over the steaming poultry, which smells of smoke and ashen fat. You crack open a Coke. And you start to devour a bird whose charred exterior and bracing capsaicin buzz make it, without question, one of the city’s finest chickens.', 'The cost for a small order is just $6.', 'Island culture is New York culture. And if there’s any doubt about that, consider the following: Nearly 2 million people are expected to attend this weekend’s Labor Day Parade in Crown Heights, an annual West Indian celebration of such epic proportions it earned a line in Jay-Z’s anthemic Empire State of Mind. ', 'One in five foreign-born New Yorkers hails from the non-Hispanic Caribbean, which explains why the city packs such an ample supply of Trinidadian roti, Haitian griot, and Belizean curried shrimp. Jerk in particular thrives along Nostrand and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn — the heart of the city’s West Indian community. The culinary style traces its mouth-stinging lineage to Jamaica; it developed in the 1700s as a fusion between the pit-cooking techniques of escaped West African slaves and the native Taino spice rubs designed to prevent meat spoilage. ', 'The question of exactly what jerk is in the 21st century, however, has become “open for interpretation,” Island & Spice editor Rochelle Oliver wrote for the Times in July. “Is it a flavor? Is it the ingredients? Is it the way the meat is cooked? The truth lies somewhere in the middle,” she argued. In Jamaica, jerk typically involves seasoning whole hogs or chicken with a pungent mix of ingredients that grow in the island nation’s verdant interior: scallions, thyme, allspice, and chiles. The meats are then slowly smoked over resinous pimento branches, either underground or in a steel drum. In New York, this is the style loosely employed by LoLo’s in Harlem and Glady’s in Crown Heights and, as of this spring, in Prospect-Lefferts — more on that later enterprise in a bit.', 'Cooking with hardwood fuel, alas, requires expensive ventilation systems and emissions filters. That means jerking in the city often means forgoing the smoker in favor of a gas grill or oven. Miss Lily’s in Manhattan, which sells a bird that tastes like any backyard chicken, is an example of how to do this New York style of jerking poorly. Peppa’s is an example of how to do it expertly.', 'Kingston-born Gavin Hussey is the person to thank here. He opened the first Peppa’s just south of Prospect Park in 2004 and has since expanded the business with his brother Jason and his daughter Jessica, who share ownership. A Crown Heights location opened in 2016, followed by a Peppa’s near Brownsville later that year. The Hussey family is striking while the iron is hot; fast-casual chicken concepts are proliferating, from David Chang’s Fuku to Seamus Mullen’s Whirlybird to the poultry-centric Made Nice. Peppa’s is better. ', 'The Crown Heights location, the subject of this inquiry, is the only one with seating. And like all the other locations, there are a few non-chicken items, including a pile of goat curry, gorgeously funky with gelatinous meat and thick gravy and a sweet stewed oxtail over coconut rice.', 'But really, you’ve come here for the chicken. The meat is scored, washed in vinegar, marinated overnight in a rub whose ingredients no one would reveal to me, and grilled for approximately 45 minutes. Certain bites pack a clean poultry tang; others are earthy and woodsy from the flames. The skin comes off with ease, yielding to a gentle chew like a charred campfire marshmallow. The hot sauce causes your tongue to tingle or five minutes afterwards, maybe six. You dampen the heat with a forkful of coconut rice, or a sweet, craggy festival — essentially sweet, fried cornbread. The near-perfect jerk here is the type of preparation that calls into question spending $60 on a chicken for two at a passable brasserie, or $10 on the bland, overcooked birds at Whole Foods. ', 'Peppa’s is a chain worth rooting for.', 'Strolling by the sophomore location of Glady’s, on the corner of Lincoln Road and Rogers Avenue, means inhaling the heady aroma of smoldering wood. That scent is chef Junior Felix’s beacon. For nearly half a decade, Michael Jacober, a Rhode Island native not of West Indian descent, has been the unlikely public face of the popular Caribbean restaurant. But with the opening of the Prospect-Lefferts outpost this spring, Jacober has stepped back, letting the chef, a native St. Lucian who’s been involved in virtually every recipe Glady’s has ever developed, oversee the space as a co-owner. ', 'Felix ensures that anything carrying the name jerk is jerked the classic way: via a sauna of fragrant smoke. He prepares all the meats over a custom smoker that sits behind the counter, a rectangular steel edifice built by a guy called Alabama Joe. He cooks pork and chicken at 275 degrees for about 2.5 hours — hotter and faster than most American ’cue. The wood selection, in turn, departs a bit from Jamaican traditions. Felix uses a mix of domestic maple and ash, alongside traditional pimento chips, which impart a flavor that some liken to bay leaves.', 'The jerk, sweet and vaguely piney with expertly rendered fats, calibrated heat, and bracing pungency, is so good that Glady’s is as much in conversation with Peppa’s as it is with a place like Hometown or Mighty Quinn’s. The comparison is important. There’s long been a tendency to overcategorize affordable or unfamiliar foodstuffs, to relegate them to a series of polite “best of brackets” rather than to critique them within the larger context of the city’s dining traditions. And so in the case of Glady’s, its place within the jerk community is just one story; the bigger picture is that it’s one of the the city’s most accomplished barbecue restaurants. And Felix is without question one of New York’s top pitmasters.', 'Warning: The Prospect-Lefferts sequel doesn’t have the same frenetic, the-waitlist-is-full, everyone’s-cramped-together-jerk-eating energy as the original location. The space here is larger and emptier. There is no wait and there are no waiters; the new Glady’s is counter-service only. And the design ethos is technicolor eclectic with wood-paneled benches, cushy teal banquettes, crimson flooring, orange pressed-tin walls, outdoor picnic tables, and church-like stained glass windows. ', 'My prediction is that the crowds will pick up for a very basic reason: the food is better here than at the original. Glady’s 1.0 cooks with a combi-oven, an expensive device that lets Felix bombard his meats with wet heat, dry heat, and the pleasant fumes of wood chips. The proper smoker at Glady’s 2.0, by contrast, makes a noticeable difference, imbuing the chicken ($9.50) with a deeper mahogany hue. That exterior is wonderfully leathery, a toothsome counterpart to the soft meat. The flavor is all sweet smoke at first — the poultry flavor isn’t as assertive as at Peppa’s — followed by the clove-like warmth of the allspice berry and then bucking heat of the Scotch bonnet. The tongue vibrates in such a way that recalls good Sichuan fare.', 'You quell the pain with a Pinata, a bracingly tart slush of mezcal, grapefruit, and lime, or a Kid Kreyol, a perfumed blend of Haitian rums, lime, honey and guava. Shannon Mustipher is the mind behind these creations; she’s one of the rare restaurant bartenders who can put together a list of drinks that’s simultaneously original, well-balanced, and food-friendly. The painkiller ($10), that classic mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, and nutmeg, is somewhat sugary on its own, and rightly so. It counters the aggressive salting and sharp aromas of Felix’s jerk pork ($9.50). On some nights the swine’s fats are pleasantly chewy; on other nights they’re softer and more rendered, with a flesh that evokes tender jerky. ', 'Guyanese chow mein — ramen tossed in soy and sesame — is a good way to keep from overloading on the luscious proteins, even if it omits the traditional egg noodles. For flavors that are lighter on both salt and smoke, the goat curry serves as a study in using coconut milk to convey the musky flavors of the ruminant and the gentle heat of habanero. Jacober tells me he’ll soon start exporting the Jerk Center meats to the flagship, but for now, the Prospect-Lefferts location is the Glady’s to visit. May there be more Caribbean restaurants.', 'Cost: Nothing over $13. Small lunch orders are $6. Dinner for two should cost no more than $20-$25.

51,"['The restaurant from Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli is the rare red sauce spot that challenges diners', 'Italian-American restaurants are simple. They’re not known for their freewheeling interpretations of classics or elegantly composed small plates; instead, they’re cultural treasures famous for adherence to tradition, having provided unfussy nourishment to New Yorkers since the early 20th century. They’re places where the marinara is cooked until it’s as crimson as a fire engine and where a chef’s visual style is best described as “make sure the food fits on the plate.”', 'The point of a red sauce joint is not to surprise, but to sate, which is what makes Don Angie in the West Village such a curious outlier. It does both. Chefs Angie Rito and Scott Tacinelli make their own amari, not out of obscure bitter herbs but rather out of sarsaparilla (it tastes like boozy root beer). They crust chicken scarpariello with a layer of fennel sausage and serve it sliced, giving it the appearance of an elegant French terrine. And they make garlic bread by stuffing sesame-seeded flatbread with stracchino and Parmesan. The nutty, stretchy affair is closer to a Ligurian focaccia di recco or an Indian cheese paratha than the toasty, mozzarella-topped product with which most suburbanites are familiar. ', '“I wouldn’t have known this was Italian-American food if you hadn’t told me,” a companion admitted during a meal here, which means Don Angie is doing what so many other cuisines are allowed to do: surprise (and challenge) diners just a little bit, and by doing so, evolve.', 'Once upon a time, New York had another Don Angie of sorts. Its name was Torrisi, and it opened in 2010. It was a tiny tasting spot that sought a freeform future for red sauce fare, serving up dishes that both celebrated Italian-American cooking and exalted New York multiculturalism. There were high-end riffs on Manhattan clam chowder, Cantonese-style chicken oysters, Jamaican beef patty ragus, and Manischewitz-glazed lamb chops. ', 'As a sequel, the team behind Torrisi opened the more retro-minded Carbone, embracing the traditions of yesteryear, reinterpreting postwar Italian-American chophouses through better techniques, better ingredients, stratospheric prices, and scattered Godfather and Goodfellas references. It wouldn’t take too long for Carbone to pop up elsewhere, in Las Vegas and Hong Kong, just as Olive Garden expanded to Mexico City and Kuwait. Torrisi, in turn, would close after five years. Like it so often does, nostalgia won out over more forward-looking innovation.', 'Don Angie picks up where Torrisi left off; Rito was a longtime chef at that tasting-menu restaurant. And while the digs are decidedly old-school — rounded archways, warm lighting, checkered floors — the high levels of acid and global influences make the venue the Italian-American equivalent of a French neobistro. That is to say: The chefs took a staid genre, updated it, internationalized it, refined dishes here and there, but kept everything pretty affordable. ', 'Clockwise from top left: The dining room at Don Angie; pepperoni fried rice with squid; the restaurant’s summertime sidewalk patio; a chrysanthemum caesar salad', 'This type of smart creativity isn’t what one expects from the operator: Quality Branded, a group known for its reliable food yet somewhat gimmicky flourishes, be it Park Avenue, a restaurant that changes its decor with the seasons, or Quality Italian, whose kitchen Tacinelli and Rito oversee as well. At that latter venue, the duo earned a certain degree of fame (or notoriety?) for grinding up chicken and frying it up into the shape of a parm pizza for, like, $60.', 'Don Angie’s subversions are more studied. Prosciutto with melon — the sweet-salty staple of hotel conference buffets — finds new life here thanks to toasted hazelnuts, for crunch, and tamarind, for pucker. The chefs reimagine Caesar salad, a dish created by an Italian immigrant living in Mexico, by swapping out the lettuce for a canopy of herbaceous chrysanthemum. When finished with Parmesan, the dish packs the fluffy texture of cotton candy.  ', 'Rito and Tacinelli send out snapper tartare hidden under a layer of raw trumpet mushrooms, Ignacio Mattos style, amping up the fungi flavors of a tart porcini dashi. ', 'And they throw together a superb fried rice, lacing the grains with pepperoni, charring the bottom layer like a Spanish paella, and topping it all off with a silky mound of seared calamari. The dish reflects an understanding of Italian-American fare that recalls the way Empellon’s Alex Stupak approaches Mexican cuisine; it’s not so much a classically elevated preparation as it is a take on red sauce fare as a larger set of ideas. ', 'Italian-American restaurants have long been some of the city’s toughest tables, from the aforementioned Carbone in Greenwich Village to Rao’s in East Harlem. “More or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club,” Pete Wells wrote in his two-star review early this spring. Reservations still book up well in advance, but walk-ins are usually accommodated at the bar in under 45 minutes or so, a wait that will admittedly lengthen when the patio closes for the winter. ', 'One could easily justify any sort of wait, quite frankly, for Don Angie’s cantaloupe caramelle. The kitchen takes black and yellow dough — as vivid as the colors of a Pittsburgh Steelers uniform — and cuts it into oblong dumplings, stuffing each sachet with buffalo milk ricotta and twisting the ends like old-fashioned candy bar wrappers. The dairy oozes out from the caramelle when pierced, softening the agrodolce rush of a pickled cantaloupe sauce. The pairing recalls a 1980s-style blend of cottage cheese and fruit, taken to Michelin-worthy heights. My companion called it a failed experiment. I call it perfect.', 'Equally stunning are the sopressini with smoked mussels, the folds of pasta slicked with an electric emulsion of pimenton, anchovy sauce, lime, Sriracha, and cilantro. One could turn the sauce into a sandwich spread and it would taste no less refined.', 'For mains: Skip the shell steak, burdened under a layer of confit lemon thick enough to count as cake frosting. Better is the orata, sitting in a pool of Mexican-style guajillo oil, lending just a gentle flicker of smoke. Veal da pepi, perhaps the city’s best rendition of Milanese, exhibits layers of flavor and texture that would wow a tempura chef. The softness of the meat, the crunch of the fry, the saltiness of the prosciutto topping, and the deep, rich flavors of carraway are a rare hat tip to tradition here.', 'In addition to a few standard desserts — a mascarpone-heavy tiramisu, a zeppole with honey — there’s something that looks precisely like a ball of mozzarella with olive oil. As if. In this little bit of trompe l’oeil, the chefs mold house-made mochi around obscenely milky fior di latte gelato. This classic Japanese pairing of rice flour and ice cream is often stretchy and edible with one’s hands — not too dissimilar, in theory, from fresh mooz. Problem is, Don Angie serves it at a temperature so low it requires a bit of knife-and-fork action. It evokes cheese that’s spent too much time in the fridge. That’s a small gripe, however, for a dish that essentially manages to reinvent mozzarella. Sometimes a risk is more exhilarating than perfect execution or deference to tradition. That’s a lesson more Italian-American spots could learn.', 'Cost: Starters under $18; pastas under $25; mains under $34. Lasagna for two is $65; prime rib braciole for two is $116. Desserts under $11.', 'Sample dishes: Stuffed garlic flatbread, chrysanthemum Caesar, squid fried rice, buffalo milk caramelle, sopressini and smoked mussels, chicken scarpariello, veal “da pepi,” fior di latte mochi.', 'Bonus tip: Reservations can be tough to come by; walk-ins are accommodated at the bar or at the outdoor tables without too ridiculous a wait.']"
52,"['Of all the tableside service routines — flambeing, liquid nitrogen dipping, cacio e pepe-ing in a cheese wheel, Dover sole deboning — the one that’s often the most transformative is also the least obtrusive: the a la minute pour. You’ve seen it a thousand times: a waiter takes a carafe and artfully spills it over your plate with the flick of a wrist. Roll your eyes all you want, but there’s a purpose here. It’s about technique — ensuring a steamy broth doesn’t overcook, say, langoustines while they’re en route to the dining room. And it’s about storytelling — watching a monochromatic fish, perhaps black bass, come into focus as its surroundings are drenched in a black truffle puree.  ', 'Execution, of course, is half the battle, which brings us to Soogil, an ambitious East Village Korean spot by chef Soogil Lim. A waiter ferries over a pot of steamed tofu flan, a white canvas garnished with pink shrimp, littleneck clams, crosshatched squid, verdant scallions, and crimson chiles. And then it all slowly disappears as the server picks up a tiny kettle and pours an opaque seafood broth; the soup’s ferric hue suggests day turning to dusk. ', 'To be precise, that’s how it all looks in fancy online photos. It was served to me differently. A waiter walked over and dumped in the broth before I had a chance to see what was inside. It was an oversight that turned something visually striking, a collection of kaleidoscopic ingredients a chef put a lot of care into plating, into something pedestrian. It looked like any other bowl of soup. ', 'It’s not the only time service gets in the way of a meal here.', '“I wish LA would embrace Modern Korean cuisine like NYC has,” Eater Los Angeles editor and Korean food expert Matthew Kang tweeted last year. Indeed, while Southern California’s largest city is famous for its deep bench of traditional Korean spots, New York is making a name for itself with more contemporary riffs on that country’s fare. There’s Jungsik, with its $225 caviar and wagyu-laced tasting menus; Jeju, a sleek noodle shop slinging some of the city’s most elegant (and fiery) ramyun broths; Oiji, a breathtaking small-plates place that drizzles gochugaru butter over abalone; and Cote, the country’s only Michelin-starred Korean barbecue spot, a venue as famous for its prime galbi as its pink and boozy frosé.', 'When my friends visit New York, a modern Korean spot, alongside a Jewish deli or a Brooklyn barbecue joint, is increasingly among the first few places I’ll recommend. And while Soogil, which opened four months ago, isn’t quite as consistent as its peers, some of its work-in-progress dishes are delicious enough experiments to merit a meal.', 'Take that tableside seafood soup again. The broth tasted of chile-laced ocean. The squid, in turn, was tender and almost creamy, while the shrimp were sweet if aggressively overcooked. And the steamed layer of tofu exhibited the softness of a marshmallow but packed an earthiness that conjured up visions of roasted corn. When kitchen and service staff get this dish right, and I’m betting they will, it will be one of the city’s great seafood preparations.', 'Lim certainly has the pedigree of an overperformer. He spent seven years working at Daniel, one of the city’s most respected French restaurants, before moving on to an executive chef position at Hanjan, a heralded Korean gastropub in the Flatiron district. ', 'At Soogil, he likes to blend those Asian and Gallic sensibilities. Such efforts are not always successful. Every few minutes a loud hiss and sizzle echoes through the room, a cloud of steam rises up over someone’s table, and for a few brief seconds, the entire restaurant smells of caramel. This is the result of a waiter pouring soy over a hot metal plate, the final flourish for a dish of foie gras atop crispy rice. This tableside pomp, alas, is for naught; the kitchen sears the duck liver to a meaty medium rare, but the rice is simply a disc of hot mush, with little of the promised crunch.', 'Better are the medallions of monkfish, soft and delicate above a spicy layer of lobster sauce. Or consider the elegant slices of mackerel, gently grilled and placed over nigiri-length satchels of Swiss chard-wrapped rice, the grains laced with just enough ssamjang to faintly sting the tongue.', 'Soogil is a handsome little restaurant, a single room with blonde wood tables, brown plank floors, and exposed brick walls. Dining here can be a profoundly relaxing experience; one can sip on cold kimchi soup, a brilliant foil to warm, stretchy sweet potato beignets, while overlooking the trees of Fourth Street, visible through the open doors. Also visible through the doors, on one night, is a crowd of 10 folks, some of them standing around waiting to be acknowledged by a host.', 'Dining here can also be stressful. One staffer might forget your drink, while another might take away your jar of rice beer away before it’s finished. If you’re sitting at the counter, servers sometimes talk across you to the bartender, as if they were patrons at a Murray Hill watering hole waiting to get a vodka soda. I watched a frustrated patron struggle to get a check, then flag down another server to retrieve her credit card, which didn’t come back with the bill. ', 'Good food helps some of these mishaps fade into the background; such is the case with a mung-bean pancake. Lim deep-fries the pork fat-laced batter until the exterior has a deep, almost mahogany crunch. The resulting creation, topped with a tart slaw of kimchi, could easily pass for a high-grade chicken croquet in a blind taste test. Then you wait nearly half an hour for a main course, a few blubbery slabs of pork belly; luckily, the accompanying radish kimchi rolls, a wallop of restrained bitterness, stand on their own with aplomb.', 'Spicy chicken is a solid entrant into the poultry category; the kitchen stews drumsticks with gochugaru and root vegetables until they are chopstick tender and infused with the savory oomph of salted shrimp sauce. ', 'Those looking to sate their beef fix might try the floppy little mops of deftly seared eye round; they sit atop a soft pile of japchae noodles. The soy- and sugar-braised short rib, by contrast, needs work; it’s a slab of gray, sinewy meat, with scant tenderness, beefiness, or sweetness.', 'Desserts also have a steep hill to climb. There are just two: a fine, forgettable nest of chewy fried dough with honey chestnut gelato, and a leaden passionfruit tart, denser than overchilled supermarket pudding and without any of the fruit’s naturally vibrant acidity. ', 'With a modern Korean scene so competitive, Soogil will need to improve. ', 'Cost: Pretty affordable! Most shared plates are $16 or under, though the foie gras crispy rice is $23, while the larger short rib is $26.', 'Sample dishes: Sweet potato beignets with chilled white kimchi, glass noodles with bulgogi, Spanish mackerel with Swiss chard-wrapped rice, mung-bean pancake, organic spicy chicken.', 'Bonus tip: Check online reservations before swinging by as a walk-in, because even bar seats, which can be booked in advance, sometimes get snatched up a few days out at the busiest times.

Visitors, after all, don’t leave MoMA raving about a brilliantly penned caption; they rave about witnessing one of the world’s great collections. Diners, just the same, don’t get excited about a thrilling rendition of menu copy. They get excited about good food and service.', 'Restaurants, like good books or paintings, are often best enjoyed as they are, without someone explaining what everything means before each new plate of pasta. That’s why, at first glance, one might raise an eyebrow at Atomix, the tasting-menu sequel to small plates-centric Atoboy. It’s a modern Korean spot that produces as much reading material as it does food. After shelling out the full price of dinner online, guests descend to the lower floor of a Midtown East townhouse, take seats around a marble chef’s counter, and spend the next two and hours drinking, eating, and chatting. And studying. ', 'Eggplant with eel four ways — sauced, powdered, smoked, and moussed — practically melts on the tongue like fresh burrata. It’s a two-bite dish. And yet it’s accompanied by a menu card that’s 240 words long. The reading process literally takes longer than the eating process. ', 'The cards are repeated for each of the 10 or so courses. And against all odds (um, remember Romera?), they help make Atomix one of the city’s most exciting new bastions of haute gastronomie in years. As forgettable as it might be, a museum caption — or something like it — can sometimes offer just the right amount of guidance.', 'Ellia Park, who runs Atomix with her partner, chef Junghyun Park, places a card in front of me. On the front is a depiction of fish scales in abstract form. On the opposite side is a list of ingredients and small essay. I ignore it.', 'Servers, dressed in loose gray tops designed by Sungho Ahn, parade out plates of golden eye snapper colored like Easter eggs. The skin shimmers in a vibrant hue of pink, while an omelet pancake covers the underbelly. The charcoal-singed exterior lends smoke and crunch to the fatty flesh, while the egg imparts a hint of sweetness. And a tiny quenelle of jinjang sauce — more on what that is in a second — adds an intense savoriness. Nothing is complicated or ambiguous about the masterful dish; the components are enjoyable without additional explanation.', 'But out of curiosity, I check the card, wondering what type of diesel-powered flavor motor was powering the sauce. Traditional dried anchovy. And what was that wonderfully thick texture from? Modernist flourishes like xanthan gum and agar agar, per a list of ingredients as long as that of a Snickers bar. And a month after the meal, I read that little essay, about how the sauce owes its complexity to an aged soy called jinjang — that’s been fermented for five years. So what was apparently just another delicious dish is actually, the diner understands, something more meaningful and contextual, a blending of the new and the old.', 'One of the chief ignominies of the modern tasting temple is that menus are either banished altogether or transformed into inscrutable lists of nouns (my favorite: “Wagyu, porcini, garden”). Neither option does much good when you’re trying to prime your palate for a one-bite course, or when you want something more detailed than an iPhone pic to jog your memory following a long dinner. Atomix’s cards solve that problem, letting guests focus on minor components they might overlook, like the dried sea cucumber innards used to season thinly sliced beef.', 'But more broadly, the cards convey deeper meaning to anyone who wants to think beyond whether a meal simply tastes good, answering the type of questions that would otherwise involve recording an interview with the chef or buying a restaurant’s 10-pound coffee table cookbook. Like an opera program that helps a viewer navigate the minutiae of Tosca, or a gallery blurb that lets visitors make sense a perplexing Cubist work, the menu cards serve an equally important purpose. They employ a bit of unobtrusive explaining to make a complicated and expensive art form more accessible.', 'After a flight of amuses — the best of which is a Tostitos-style scoop chip made from mussel juices instead of corn — a waiter presents guests a fabric case filled with chopsticks. Some are blue and shiny. Others are matte and textured. The gesture recalls a touch of absurdity that plagued the early days of Alain Ducasse at the Essex House (RIP), where guests were asked to choose their squab knives and pick from a cornucopia of pens with which to sign their (astronomical) bill.', 'True to form, the Parks command the type of prices one would expect for this style of dining: $175, or $225 after tax and service. That easily puts Atomix in the same ballpark as some of the city’s venerable European, American, or Japanese spots, venues with which it ably competes. For a menu of this length, it’s even a tidy sum less than Jungsik ($290 after tax and tip), the two-Michelin-starred bastion of Korean fine dining in Tribeca, where chef Park served as the chef de cuisine. ', 'If Jungsik is about elevating and refining traditional Korean dishes, with its foie gras mandoo and its short-rib galbi, Park’s cooking here is more freeform, treating the East Asian peninsula more as a firm point of inspiration than a culinary bible. ', 'He forms a small nest out of slithery baby shrimp, anoints them with slices of radish pickled in cherry blossom vinegar, and juxtaposes the study in white with a puree of orange persimmon — all the colors of a Creamsicle. The restrained sugars and floral notes wouldn’t feel out of place at a high-end kaiseki spot. ', 'He assembles banchan, the classic Korean side dish, out of Hokkaido uni, fresh tofu, and chestnut puree. The genius isn’t how the three flavors match — they don’t — it’s how the three powerful flavors register at the same level. Even the soybean curd bursts with a next-degree earthiness.', 'He pairs a French-style seared duck breast, preternaturally crispy and musky, with a thick paste whose complex notes of raisins, cumin, and chocolate recall... Mexican food? The menu card, as it turns out, explains the sauce as a gochujang mole.', 'Like at almost any (and quite frankly too many) tasting-menu venues, stereotypical international luxuries make regular appearances here. But Atomix’s use of them comes across less like a crutch, and more like a genuine innovation. The chef whittles halibut into a round disc. The first bite is soft, flaky, mild. A second bite reveals a layer of foie gras terrine underneath, imparting a buttery oomph to the neutral fish. A third bite causes the liver to spill out, clouding the surrounding pool of squash dashi with its pink hue. ', 'Park eschews stereotypical caviar pairings. Instead, he places firm beads of golden osetra atop a parfait of fresh cheese and pine-nut puree. The dairy tames the maritime oils while the sweet pignoli counteracts the roe’s rampant salts. The ingredients are absurdly refined, but the interplay of sugar, salt, and fat is little different than in a breakfast of pancakes with syrup, butter, and bacon. ', 'And while a few bits of wagyu are little different from their counterparts elsewhere, what is different are the accompaniments: a small pool of pear juice and a tidy row of fermented garlic, ramps, and wasabi leaves. Their purpose is simple: To cut through the richness. ', 'The meal winds down with an ice of hydrangea tea, followed by a melange of corn marmalade, roasted corn, and sesame oil ice cream. The latter dessert channels the powerfully vegetal notes of maize with a level of subtlety that recalls the famed husk pudding at Cosme, one of the city’s best Mexican spots. Atomix might be a Korean restaurant, but like New York — or at least the New York we dream of — it earns its keep by transcending borders and defying trends.', 'Cost: $175 for the tasting, prepaid via Tock, which works out to $226 after tax and 20 percent service. Wine pairings are available for an additional $155.', 'Sample dishes: Mussel tart with thistle leaf, wagyu with dried sea cucumber, white shrimp with persimmon, halibut with butternut squash dashi and foie gras, duck with gochujang mole, sesame oil ice cream with corn marmalade.', 'Bonus tip: A la carte small plates available at the bar (walk-ins only), including house-dried beef jerky and rice-stuffed fried chicken wings with numbing chopi powder.']"

And it was mostly men — wearing skinny jeans, no socks, blazers pulled tightly around fit torsos, and button-downs unbuttoned one button more than most, at least on this coast. I wouldn’t mention it, except the servers underscore the atmosphere at Avery, which can be summed up in two words: bachelor pad. It’s like a dark, boxy, barely decorated apartment rented by a single, 30-something guy who happens to be a really good cook. ', 'And when I showed up alone on a Friday night, it felt like an awkward first date. Greeting me was nothing — and no one — but a floating black slotted wall. I stood staring at it until my husband arrived. Eventually the host showed up. “Welcome to Avery,” he said, unaware we’d been waiting. ', '“You’ll be joining us tonight for the Cello Player menu?” he asked, I assumed rhetorically. We were unsure of the actual name of the menu we purchased, anyway, as we’d prepaid through Tock earlier that week. The more expensive one, I wanted to say. We followed him through the small, hushed dining room, past a lone table of four, and up a set of black stairs to the second-floor dining room. It looked the same as the first, just without windows.', 'Chef Rodney Wages slicing jamón Iberico', 'There, the awkwardness continued. We looked at our server. Our server looked at us. We looked at our menu, a vertical cut of calligraphy paper scrawled, simply, in black ink: “Grains,” “Oyster,” “Curry.” It was pretty and poetic, but clearly called for some sort of introduction, which we never got. So we asked. After a seven-minute monologue describing each of the seven courses, plus all of the possible “additions” — like trout roe, “caviar bump,” and spicy lobster with sea urchin — he wandered off, without asking if we’d like to start with anything to drink.

We’d prepaid for the 13- to 15-course Shades of Spring menu, which was supposed to include all of those decadent add-ons. An honest error, but we would’ve left cheated had we not realized. And — as I learned when we later tried Cello — still hungry enough to eat an off-menu hot dog at the Progress across the street.', 'I let our server know about the mix-up, which led to more awkwardness: scurrying, whispering. Apparently we should’ve been seated downstairs with the handful of fellow high rollers who had also paid $189 per person. Instead, we were seated upstairs, with the commoners who’d paid a mere $89 per person. We were told to stay put. Our menus were whisked away.

We also came to drink sake — the restaurant has a sake sommelier, after all — except we still had yet to be offered any. Ultimately, we came for chef Rodney Wages, whose resume is studded with all-star venues like the French Laundry, Benu, Saison, and Atelier Crenn.', 'I never made it to his pop-up, RTB Fillmore (RTB as in “Rod the Bod,” a nickname courtesy of his  pals at Saison).

And now we have yet another elaborate, expensive tasting menu in a high-flying town that’s teeming with them.

It’s like culinary hedonism’s greatest hits: Pearls of smoked trout roe are piled into a pair of golden spoons over crushed avocado with sesame, and accompanied by cured kampachi in a spicy-sweet sunomono with preserved citrus, crowned with a crisp of kelp. ', 'A tin of osetra caviar arrives in a crystal bowl of crushed ice. It’s served as a bona fide “bump”— the server spoons the eggs onto your fist along with a dollop of smoked creme fraiche, then drapes it all in a fat slab of barbecued wagyu beef fat. (Yes, all on your fist.) It’s a salty, smoky, slippery slurp, enlivened by a perfect pop. The effect is similar to the drug it alludes to: I immediately wanted more — although not at $68 a hit.', 'Also, an island of Fort Bragg uni floats in a rich red broth made from lobster shells, spiked with espelette pepper. It’s the four-star version of a Fisherman’s Wharf cioppino, and I savored the slow burn of every slurp. ', 'And of course there is foie gras, twin silky, smoky morsels in a light garlicky broth encircled, like a team of synchronized swimmers, by hand-pinched tortellini: delicate pouches concealing shiitake mushrooms and a burst of cultured butter that vanishes. “This might be the star that steals the show,” Mako warned, his chest hair emphasizing the cheesiness of his line. But he’s right.', 'Until the 12th course, when the “snow beef” shows up: a pair of rosy, marbled hunks of A5 wagyu, perfectly seared. “He’s the Jedi of beef,” said our server, referring to its famous Hokkaido rancher, Fujio Terauchi. The $78 price for this “supplement” had looked preposterous when I saw it on our wrong menu earlier, but biting into the charred, buttery meat — velvet incarnate, really — it almost made sense. ', 'It at least made economical sense to go for the whole Shades of Spring shebang rather than to tack the beef onto the cheaper, briefer Cello. ', 'Money and value is a funny thing, though, when it comes to tasting menus. These days, we’re seeing more and more of them in the Bay Area at all price points. We’re paying for the food, but at $89, $189, or, in the case of Avery’s private room, $289 per person, we’re also paying for the experience. Avery excels in the former. I revered, and demolished, almost every dish. There were just two blips: The spiny lobster curry, which was overpowered by mint, and tasted like the world’s most expensive cup of Scope; and the cheese tart, which was gloppy and flimsy and, as the penultimate course, oddly incongruous with an otherwise exceptional parade. ', 'But as for everything else, Avery is lacking — no matter where you sit. On my second visit, despite booking the less expensive menu, we were seated downstairs in the supposedly nicer space. Perhaps because they’d remembered they’d messed up last time, or perhaps because they’d recognized me last time. It later became clear I’d been outed — and possibly overserved, yet never charged for it.', 'Maybe they thought if I drank enough sake by the end of the meal, I’d forget all about its clumsy start.', 'Nope. That’s the problem. No matter how seamlessly my second supper went, no matter how wonderful Wages’ cooking, the vibe is too immature for its price tag; the experience too stiff and stilted and salesy.

55,"['San Francisco has been obsessed with Japanese food for quite some time now — with sushi, of course, but also with izakaya, a craving that arguably began with Nombe, back in 2010. That was soon followed by the 2013 ramen rage that has yet to let up. And there are now more ultra-expensive omakase restaurants in the city than there are McDonald’s. Oh yes and San Francisco recently spawned the world’s first “experiential showroom” for Japan’s most groundbreaking Toto Washlet’s new showroom touting its $5,000 heated toilets with heated seats. And yet, for some reason, the joy of a Japanese breakfast has yet to become a local craze. ', 'Which is why, on a cold, wet weekday morning at Cassava, at the far western end of Balboa Street, I had my pick of empty tables before a few solo regulars sauntered in. Everyone was there for the same thing: the pretty, puzzle-like, Kaiseki-style assemblage, comprising a steaming-hot covered bowl of soothing miso soup with chewy slabs of kombu; another palm-sized bowl with a gently poached egg swimming in a dashi broth; yet another bowl brimming with light and fluffy koshihikari rice; a small plate of broiled rock cod; plus three mini saucers bearing kimchi, pickled daikon, and the fermented salty-gooey soybeans known as natto, if you so choose. (I so chose, and realized it was an acquired taste I hadn’t yet acquired.)

He staged at Kikunoi, a then two-Michelin-starred restaurant in Tokyo, and later opened Luce with Dominique Crenn. They offer the requisite San Francisco breakfast stuff, too. But, midweek at least, they needn’t bother. No one I witnessed that rainy morning was eating anything other than Japanese breakfast.

I gave up sidewalk swarming for eggs — even runny, sweet, sous vide, poached-in-the-shell ones — after I once tried and failed to do so with a newborn (sunny Saturday; the Mission; 1.5-hour wait; baby wailing; once finally seated, diaper leaks on lap). Now, with or without my kids, I’m all about the brunch reservation. Attention everyone wasting away your Saturday: Cassava takes them.', 'And I would certainly go for lunch. (Well, if I were blowing off work and meeting a friend who lived in the outer avenues and we paired it with a stroll on the beach or something.)', 'I’d also most definitely reserve a table for dinner. There was nothing especially Japanese about the meal, other than the quiet warmth and attentiveness from Ioroi upon arrival and our right-on-time seating. Cassava was “inspired by the great cafes of France,” the owners explained in their 2013 Kickstarter campaign, which raised more than $30,000. They used the funds to triple seating and add a heated sidewalk patio with a small edible garden. ', 'The dinner menu is in sync with its atmosphere: calming and homey, start to finish, from the seeded Marla Bakery bread with sweet honey butter to the thick-crisp fried chicken starter made with boneless, buttermilk-marinated thigh meat to a rich black garbanzo bean stew with bacon and chanterelles. ', 'My premeditated entree order instantly changed when I glanced over at the next table and spied a plate heaped with perfectly charred hunks of rosy-rare hanger steak, multicolored marble potatoes, and freshly plucked leaves of Bloomsdale spinach. (Apologies to the Mount Lassen trout I let go.)', 'Glitches were few but glaring. Like the soft-talking server who seemed better suited to Tassajara monastery than waiting tables. He responded to my question about a particular red wine with a “Well, I don’t drink.” (Okay, thank you.) A wedge of pickled mackerel was unctuous and outstanding, but came flanked, oddly, by a mound of cultured butter churned in house. “Should we spread the butter on the fish?” we asked our server. “You could,” he replied, apparently equally confused by its presence. ', 'And despite the initial outpouring of attention, mid-meal we felt ignored. Eventually, my friend had no choice but to raise her hand — and keep it raised like an eager fourth grader — until our monk eventually came over and welcomed her question: “May we have some salt, please?” Most entrees needed it, especially the quinoa porridge with meaty chanterelles and poached egg. The slow-braised short ribs did too. Though the meat fell off the bone, as it should, it lacked flavor. It looked like short ribs, and had the texture of short ribs, but tasted, somehow, like… nothing.', 'Dessert, on the other hand, was like a creamy cloud. I’ve never been much of a panna cotta fan, though I’ll take it over flan any day. It’s a texture thing — both are typically too jiggly and Jell-O-y for my tastes. But Cassava’s blood-orange panna cotta — served in a ceramic bowl, and topped with curls of candied peels and a lone raspberry — convinced me of its potential. As we scraped the last of it, a friend and Outer Richmond neighbor, who’d donated to Cassava’s Kickstarter campaign, wandered in with her book for dinner at the low-slung counter. “Next time, you have to get the dark-chocolate mousse,” she advised. ', '“Will do,” I replied. ', '“Let me know,” she said. “I’m here all the time.” ', 'I would be too if I lived nearby. Rare is a neighborhood restaurant, or any restaurant, that excels at one meal a day, let alone three. Not to mention, there’s a ridiculously reasonable $42-per-person prix fixe that pulls from the menu’s stars, including the hanger steak and panna cotta.', 'From LA to Soho to Sacramento Street, the all-day cafe has become a thing as of late — chic spots where you can plug in and peck away from dawn to dusk. Cassava is not that. It’s a real restaurant with an unfussy kitchen and a round-the-clock following. And it’s not in a hotel with a built-in clientele, or downtown with guaranteed foot traffic, or at San Francisco International Airport with a steady stream of travelers. It’s way out on 36th Avenue, far from the frenzy of the Mission or the shine of the Marina, across from a dentist office and an optometrist office. And bonus: It is a block or two from the old-school Balboa Theatre.', 'It is peaceful and powder blue, with walled-in windows and a baffling number of off-season wreaths and not a single bar of Wi-Fi. Which is to say, Cassava is neither trendy nor convenient — and that’s exactly what I like about it. Serve good food, and it doesn’t need to be. ', 'What it costs: $42 per person for the prix fixe, which the owners call a “tasting menu.” Otherwise a digestible $120 or so before tax or tip for a couple of starters, two mains, a dessert, and two glasses of wine.', 'What to drink: Wine on Wednesdays, when bottles are 50 percent off. On “Thursty Thursdays,” pitchers of blood-orange sangria are $20, versus double that on other days.', 'What to eat: Fried chicken, hanger steak, pickled mackerel (without the butter), panna cotta, and Japanese breakfast.', 'Bonus tip: I repeat: brunch reservations.', '']"
56,"['The Mexican spot in Greenpoint is serving summery vibes and some of the finest barbacoa in the city', 'When Salazar debuted in 2016, it shook up the LA dining scene. Located near the Los Angeles River in a semi-industrial neighborhood known as Frogtown, the restaurant combined Mexican recipes and wood grilling in a way the City of Angels hadn’t seen before. The menu evoked the cuisine of the Sonoran Desert, and Salazar’s dining area was a dusty expanse of tree-shaded ground that rose up among the surrounding freeways. No better place to chill outdoors with a couple of charred carne asada tacos and a tumbler of cerveza.', 'It was an experience worth having again, and one that I’ve sought at various New York restaurants in spite of certain climatological limitations. Claro, though the owner never stepped foot in Salazar, came close, showing that the Gowanus Canal and the Los Angeles River maybe aren’t all that different. A wood-fired hearth flickered in a backyard filled with tables beneath vine-covered trellises, while cicadas buzzed merrily in the background. But though it was outstanding, it still didn’t quite recapture my LA experience.', 'Another promising contender was Gitano, an open air pop-up on Canal Street that actually originated in Tulum. There, though, the wood-fired bill of fare was half-hearted, and the atmosphere that of a battlefield combat hospital.', 'All that brings us to Oxomoco. Named after the Aztec goddess of the night, this restaurant recently planted itself deep in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint — not exactly Frogtown, but close enough when the setting sun shoots directly up Greenpoint Avenue from the East River on a sweltering summer evening.', 'There’s a spare front yard with umbrella-shaded tables that you wish had a tree or two, and a high ceilinged interior from which the vines called devil’s ivy hang down from the skylights. With its cream and beige color scheme, the room seems lavish despite its battered walls and general lack of decoration. The executive chef is Justin Bazdarich, who previously hatched the pizzeria Speedy Romeo. ', 'Besides all the ways it resembles LA’s Salazar, the restaurant is yet another example of the accelerating appreciation of Mexican food in New York — in part due to the taquerias and decades of immigrant participation in restaurant kitchens. Now, the city has an increasing awareness of regional Mexican cuisines and a willingness among diners to pay more for it, as with Italian and Japanese fare in the past.', 'Though some of the most notable restaurants serving ambitious, expensive versions of the cuisine are run by Mexican chefs (Cosme, Casa Enrique, Atla), it’s a scene that’s also conspicuously filled with people who have come to enjoy the cuisine as outsiders — like Bazdarich and his business partner Chris Walton, self-described “white kids from Missouri.” Claro and Gitano are also examples, as is the Empellon empire, where Oxomoco’s chef de cuisine Matt Conroy once worked. Here, Bazdarich pulled from his memories of traveling to the country; he and Conroy also brought on Oaxacan-born chef Kaelin Ulrich, son of famed Oaxacan chef and teacher Susana Trilling, to consult during the initial months of menu creation.', 'Despite the goofy unevenness of Speedy Romeo’s menu, Bazdarich has really hit the culinary jackpot at Oxomoco, where the tacos are every bit as good as the ones at Salazar. ', 'Best is barbacoa. At Oxomoco, lamb that has been grilled over wood, slow-cooked, and then loaded into a coarse-textured corn tortilla that will remind you of Los Angeles’s. A relish made of pipicha — a feathery herb that tastes like dirty mint — crowns the jiggly meat, as does a squash blossom that doesn’t add much but sure looks pretty riding shotgun. Sadly, the price of $16 for two tacos is exactly twice the cost at Salazar.', 'Other Oxomoco tacos worth tasting include pig cheek with green avocado salsa, flank steak with smoked eggplant relish and rubbery cotija cheese (now served with caramelized onions), and tempura-fried hake (now it’s shrimp), reminding us that the Baja Peninsula, the original home of the fish taco, is considered part of the Sonoran Desert. But a vegetarian taco of beets and potatoes intended to resemble chorizo is bland and boring.', 'Other antojitos, or corn-based staples, are worth ordering, on a menu twice as long as Salazar’s. Whatever you do, don’t miss the creamy charred-carrot tamales, which come pooled in a verdant sauce. The steak tartare tostada ($16), exceedingly fresh beef cut into a ragged dice, is preferable to a tuna tostada that makes too-lavish use of soy sauce, which clashes with the corn tortilla. In fact, I’d skip anything featuring raw fish at Oxomoco, including the hamachi aguachile. What New York City really needs is a full-blown Mexican cevicheria.', 'Instead, head for the salads, which are an unexpected delight. The heirloom tomato salad ($16) hoists little heaps of snowy queso fresco among its peaks; the dish is one of the most cooling things imaginable. A Caesar salad made with grilled Romaine is not the most original idea in the borough, but here, this commonplace dish has been turned into a top-notch treat, sodden with dressing and tasting almost as meaty as steak.', 'In fact, the chefs have proven they will smoke almost anything, including fruits that go into the cocktails. That extends, of course, to the full-blown entrees, of which there are only three. All are shareable, and two are spectacular enough you should forego some of the tacos to get them. The whole branzino ($42) has been splayed, grilled, and brushed with a piquant green sauce based the fresh Mexican herb hoja santa. It’s accompanied by Oaxacan mole amarillo, which doesn’t belong with the fish, but makes a nice dip for tortillas.', 'The best entree is a 32-ounce dry-aged ribeye, a massive hunk of meat at $99. And here we encroach further into Salazar territory. Take one bite of this juicy pink masterpiece, sliced thick, and you’ll feel like you’re dining in an isolated restaurant in LA on a warm summer evening with the traffic streaming all around you. Here, it’s Greenpoint traffic.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including an heirloom tomato salad, two barbacoa tacos, a grilled branzino, and two cocktails, including tax but not tip, $115', 'Sample dishes: charred carrot tamal, pork cheek carnitas tacos, Punta Verde Caesar salad, grilled branzino', 'What to drink: The margaritas are particularly luscious, including one made with smoked peach and another featuring watermelon juice and hoja santa.', 'Bonus tip: The menu leads off with four snacks that are something of a bargain, including roasted red-skinned peanuts with garlic and chiles ($3), and dried and smoked mango ($4). Both are good for filling up, on a menu that’s more expensive than it ought to be.', '']"
57,"['Gwyneth Paltrow doesn’t come here often, but she came here once — on the heels of Anderson Cooper, no less. And once, within weeks of opening, by two separate super-celebrities, was enough: enough to garner more than 83,000 Instagram likes between them; enough to book every online reservation for at least a month; and enough to create such a frenzy that on a recent Thursday night at 6 p.m., a friend walked up the flight of terra-cotta-tiled stairs to the host stand and was quoted a — wait for it — four-hour wait. ', 'Which is why we showed up at 5:22 p.m. on a Tuesday, eight minutes before opening, to join the lineup of actually fashionably dressed San Franciscans hoping to score one of the 46 spots generously reserved for walk-ins at the zinc-topped bar, or window ledge, or communal table. Little Star, next door, shooing people away from its entrance, wasn’t as thrilled about the swarm as the squealing women snapping so-excited-to-be-here! selfies beneath Che Fico’s sign. ', 'It’s the flashiest addition yet to the ever-gentrifying Divisadero Corridor, a bulb-lit arrow pointing to what the city’s latest crop of restaurants has been missing: a new classic. A place that both fits right in — and stands out. Che Fico has taken what we know and love about pizza and pasta and San Francisco and given it a jolt. ', 'It might’ve taken almost four years to come to fruition, but — like the wait for a table — it’s worth it. ', 'Inside is one of the most stunning, if intentionally photogenic, restaurants in San Francisco. It’s like Oakland-based designer Jon de la Cruz took the Insta-success of the lone wallpapered wall at Leo’s Oyster Bar and went nuts — well, figs — plastering the place with whimsical illustrations of leafy trees hanging with the plump, fuschia fruit. Mismatched with burnt-orange, black, and white floor tile, it creates a dizzying, almost Escher-like entrance that opens to a space so lovely — and unexpected in this city of lookalikes — that I literally gasped. ', 'There are vintage-styled leather booths mixed with stained maple tables, a long marble countertop backed by a bright-red pizza oven from Italy, and a seemingly never-ending communal table fashioned from a 200-year-old felled oak. It is light and lofty, and inoffensively large. That size, and the rustic wooden rafters (festooned with bushels of sun-dried espelette peppers), are the only signifiers of the location’s former life as an auto-repair shop. ', 'Rarely does a restaurant with so much hype actually live up to it. But from the first sip of my Coriander to the last scrape of olive oil cake through its puddle of roasted strawberry vinaigrette, I was a believer. The cocktail is casually elegant, garnished with a white blossom; it smells like a garden and tastes like gin — citrusy gin with coriander-infused curacao and housemade herbes de Provence bitters. And the fat slice of cake is as light and fluffy and life-changing as fresh snow on a Utah slope, adorned with a heavenly globe of malted yogurt gelato.', 'And then there’s everything in between: antipasti and pastas and “peasant comfort” fare, wood-fired chicken and the crusty, eye-catching Parmesan-dusted pizzas that I passed up on my first visit to leave room for the lamb loin. Hailing from Sonoma County, it’s aged for 17 days, marinated for two, then slow-roasted on the wood fire and topped by a shrub of wild watercress. Thick, meaty medallions fanned across the plate, fat blissfully intact. It’s a hefty, yet tender, undertaking for two.', 'The albacore tuna conserva is the antithesis: delicate, with too few hunks of tuna. But with wisps of radish and wedges of artichoke, it’s a wonder: tuna from Baja that’s been cured and Cryovac’d in olive oil and slow-poached before it arrives drizzled with aioli. It is fleshy and light, more silky than fishy, and blows away anything served from a jar.  ', 'Meanwhile, the pasta blew my mind. Not an easy feat in a town where house-made tagliatelle has become almost as ubiquitous as burritos. Each dish is marked with a little bubble on the menu as fatta a macchina in casa (made with an in-house pasta machine) or fatta a mano (made by hand). The orecchiette with broccoli rabe and fennel sausage sounded so standard I almost skipped it, but that would’ve been a serious mistake. The chewy, thick thimbles, tossed in goat butter, trumped every other orecchiette I’ve tried. Another big hit was the bigoli nero, a bowl of delightfully dense squid-ink noodles tangled with octopus and Dungeness crab and littlenecks, scattered with the crunch of toasted breadcrumbs. Only the mafaldini — squiggle-edged lasagna-like lemony noodles in a bland fava-leaf pesto — was a miss. But in the lumache — snail-shaped shells clinging with a pomodoro sauce burning with ’nduja and chiles — I found true love.', '', 'And in the box on the menu labeled “Cucina Ebraica,” I found my roots. Sort of. Chef David Nayfeld’s NorCal version of the Jewish-Italian tradition was clearly not mine. In 1980s suburban Boston, where I was raised, that meant Friday night platters of chicken parm with gloppy ziti from a red-sauce palace off Route 9 called Marconi’s. ', 'But, here, off Divisadero Street in 2018 San Francisco, Jewish-Italian cuisine includes locally sourced gizzards and chicken hearts and corned beef tongue. The duck liver is grilled over the wood fire, chopped, and mixed with a chicken-liver mousse. It is creamy and dreamy and something you’d think chopped liver, by its very nature, could never be: pretty. A velvety mound ringed like a hippie chick in petals of purple daikon and pickled onion, it came flanked by a single, seed-studded slab of Roman matzo that, if boxed, would put Manischewitz out of business. (Even if Nayfeld does use a reduction of its sweet wine to make the liver.) There was more liver than matzo, which was a little irritating, until I remembered I still had my fork. A chopped liver that stands on its own is a chopped liver worthy of celebration.', 'Ultimately, it’s neither Instagram nor Anderson Cooper (nor his viral post of the pineapple-red onion-fermented chile pizza, the crust of which I actually found to be too stiff, and one of the menu’s only disappointments) that is responsible for rocketing this restaurant to the top of San Francisco’s food chain. It’s the food and the drinks and the desserts. Not to mention the industry rock stars behind it: Nayfeld and his fellow Eleven Madison Park alum and Beard-winning pastry chef Angela Pinkerton — aided by co-owner Matthew Brewer and bar director Christopher Longoria, who are also ones to watch. Plus a staff that was so attentive, it at times felt stifling. They were peeking out from behind the fig trees, re-pouring water glasses still three-quarters full, and repeatedly asking “May I take that away?” a tad too soon. ', 'Still, collectively, they have created a restaurant that feels unique and exciting and of the moment, like Delfina did two decades ago, like its neighbor Nopa did 10. And if we can peer into San Francisco’s pasta- and wood-fired chicken-tangled future — it also feels like almost-40-year-old Zuni does today: timeless.', 'What it costs: It truly depends how much you want to eat. For two drinks, an antipasti, two pastas, and dessert, call it $100 before tax and tip. But tack on, say, a tongue, a pizza, a secondi for two, and a second round of drinks, and suddenly you’ve spent at least $200.', 'What to drink: Anything from the garden-themed cocktail list — the Coriander, the Thyme, the Rosemary, and the Basil are among the best. Italian wines by the glass, ranging from $11 to a reasonable (these days) $17.', 'What to eat: Tuna conserva, wood-fired octopus with crispy-skin pork belly, chopped liver, pretty much any pasta save for the mafaldini. From the wood-fire section, go lamb. And, for dessert, olive oil cake, please.', 'Bonus tip: Housemade pancetta, coppa, and pepperoni. There are more meats — hanging behind the glass — coming soon.', '']"
58,"['Funky food, natural wine, and warm service delight at Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson’s\xa0deservedly packed restaurant', 'At Frenchette, Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson’s sleek Tribeca hotspot, something unusual happens while patrons engage in the dreaded ritual of waiting for seats at a packed bar: A server walks up, presents a menu, and takes your drink order on the spot. No credit cards are requisitioned. No one behind the bar is summoned. And a few minutes later a waiter returns with, say, a Calvados and tonic — a bitter, boozy, apple-tinged highball — or a fizzy glass of sparkling gamay. ', 'The quiet courtesy lets guests focus on what’s important, which is contemplating the list of natural wines or the menu of creative Gallic fare — uni deviled eggs, anyone? — rather than forcing them to flag down a bartender or shout past fellow patrons. It’s the type of generosity that makes one think: Maybe Frenchette is worth the hour-long wait.', '“Bad food is always more tolerable than bad service.” That’s one of the axioms of hospitality industry thinking, as well as a brilliant explainer as to why your grandparents’ burnt meatloaf always manages to please: because it’s served with love! And the good news is that service, in the mechanical sense of getting stuff to a table in a timely fashion, is generally practiced at a high level throughout the city. ', 'But a larger goal of hospitality — making guests feel warm and welcome in an unfamiliar environment where they’ll spend a lot of money — is a trickier affair. Nasr and Hanson are more skilled than the overseers at other fashionable hangouts at creating a sense of belonging, a heck of a thing given that the duo hail from Minetta Tavern, a Keith McNally restaurant whose earliest days were a classic example of how not to treat humans.', 'Frenchette’s cocktail service is part of the feel-good equation. Another part is that the hosts seem genuinely excited to see guests at the door. And then there’s the fact that walk-ins aren’t just encouraged, they get about a third of the restaurant’s 105 seats; there are few better ways to make a first-time patron feel excluded than by telling them a nominally approachable cafe or brunch spot books up weeks out.', 'Hospitality is vital anywhere, but particularly clutch here, as it creates a safety net for a style of gastronomy that’s sometimes a standard deviation removed from the brasserie norm. Instead of shrimp cocktail, the kitchen sends out warm spot prawns tossed in thyme and butter; guests are instructed to eat the entire crustacean, chomping through a shell that shatters like the crisp exterior of a kouign amann. And scrambled eggs, as rich as creme anglaise, come topped not with truffles but a tiny pile of sautéed snails, amping up the buttery fats and adding an umami-studded chew. ', 'These are the types of dishes that make it tough to be dismissive of Frenchette, that make it hard to ask whether “we need another self-consciously luxurious brasserie, in a city so full of them,” as another critic wrote. The truth is that Nasr and Hanson have given New York something decidedly different. They’ve built a modern French spot in conversation with the ambitiously lean neo-bistros of Paris, a venue whose culinary exploits can feel closer to a creative small plates place than a more staid institution like Balthazar.', 'Yes, the dining room is a study in architectural riches, with red leather banquettes, white curtains, glossy sapele wood paneling, and sinuous liquor shelves that recall the space age curves of the 1960s. But in a city admittedly replete with brasseries, I can’t think of a single one dishing out ethereal fritters laced with smoked eel, or funky surf and turfs that pair oily mackerel with paper-thin veal tongue.', 'How many other French restaurants are grilling blowfish tails, dousing them in chile butter and letting the patrons gnaw the succulent flesh off the bone? They are the chicken wings of the sea. And they go perfectly with a glass of pet-nat, a class of wines whose bubbles are produced without the addition of yeast or sugar, as is the case with the methode traditionelle. The result is a low-ish alcohol content and a level of fizz gentler than most Champagnes.', 'Jorge Riera, late of Wildair, is the man behind the natural wine list, and a large reason why Frenchette is compelling as it is. The bearded beverage director roams the dining room, deciphering obscure grapes to willing imbibers, and pouring restrained reds, skin contact orange wines, and cloudy whites that sometimes boast the oxidized flavor of sherry. But what makes the wines truly special is something larger: The ever-changing selections end up forcing a more honest conversation between the guest and the waiter or sommelier.', 'If Minetta rose to fame as one of the city’s more expensive purveyors of dry-aged steaks and hamburgers, Frenchette seems destined to be a touch more accessible, with two of the signature red meat preparations offered at $34. The first and best is the duck frites; the kitchen takes the canard breasts and steams them, roasts them in a cage, and then crisps them up a second time on pickup. The silky fats and iron-y flesh are a welcome alternative to the working class indulgence that is steak frites, though Frenchette does a fine number on that staple as well. The chefs rotate among a series of cuts, from bavette, to onglet, to the petit tender. The last of the bunch, also known as teres major, sports the soft mouthfeel of a filet but exhibits a more robust beefiness. ', 'The sun-drenched flavors of the Cote D’Azur is a running theme here, which explains the fish soup — a tomato-laced misfire packing as little flavor as Campbell’s Manhattan clam chowder. Lemon- and bottarga-slicked spaghetti is a more skillful evocation of the Mediterranean, with the fragrant citrus taming the mineral overtones of the cured roe. Lamb, in turn, is broken down into the standard Provencal daube-style stew; cubes of fork tender shoulder meat sit in a summery broth of red wine and lamb jus. ', 'Rotisserie lobster smacks of clean ocean air; the soft meat drips with curried butter. And the $68 Sasso chicken for two easily feeds three. It’s a Thanksgiving feast of a dish, with golden skin as crispy as a hard taco shell, a crock of mushroom-spiked pommes puree redolent with the scent of maitakes, a baguette showered in tart vinegar, and a metal gravy boat filled with heady drippings. And while such carnivorous fare almost begs for a lighter dessert — there’s a fresh, sugary strawberry pavlova on the menu — pastry chef Michelle Palazzo excels in heartier endeavors. Cue the stunning Paris Brest, filled with enough verdant pistachio cream to qualify as a nut butter sandwich. Or consider the large format clafoutis, a wonderfully eggy cake studded with the namesake dark stone fruits.', 'It’s also tempting to keep eating that chicken in the hours following a meal at Frenchette. On a recent visit, the kitchen supplemented my leftovers with half a loaf of bread for postprandial sandwiches. The restaurant tells me this courtesy is only an occasional one, but I hope it becomes more regular. In an era where the price of dinner continues to shoot up, guests at expensively casual venues could use a nice parting gift from time to time.', 'Cost: Amuses at $8 each; starters at $16-$24; mains at $24-$38, large format dishes at $68 (whole chicken), and $112 (cote de boeuf).', 'Sample dishes: Smoked eel fritters, sea urchin deviled eggs, blowfish tails a la diable, fluke tartare, razor clams casino, duck frites, lobster with curry butter, petit tender with fries, chicken for two, rotisserie lobster with curry butter, Paris-Brest, cherry clafoutis.', 'Bonus tip: Don’t sleep on the excellent sides, from the charred carrots with labneh and za’atar, to the gnocchi parisienne — pate a choux dumplings laced with enough comte to count as a cheese course.']"
59,"['All restaurants aim to bring people together, arguably none more so than Dyafa, Oakland’s first high-profile Palestinian restaurant. Its chef, Reem Assil, hopes to foster community and conversation through food — the Middle Eastern food of her upbringing, which she says has been invisibilized in America: warm, chewy mana’eesh; smoky, charred mutabbal; silky, thick labneh; braised shakriyah the size of my leg.', 'She got off to a controversial start with her first business, Reem’s. It’s an “Arab street corner bakery” which opened in Fruitvale Village last year with support from local food business incubator La Cocina. Presiding over the counter there is a larger-than-life mural of Rasmea Odeh, a Palestinian leader convicted, some say questionably, by an Israeli court for a 1969 deadly bombing at a Jerusalem supermarket. Within Reem’s first weeks, there were public protests, death threats by pro-Israel fringe groups. But there were also rave reviews for her za’atar-dusted flatbreads and, ultimately, a James Beard nomination. It was a swift rise for someone who cut her teeth as a community organizer, not in fancy kitchens.', 'But when Assil opened Dyafa, there was no provocative mural. Instead, she opened it in partnership with nationally recognized chef Daniel Patterson on a spring day in Jack London Square, free of political drama. ', 'At that time, Assil herself had a different kind of drama: a brand-new baby. As a mother of a one-month-old, I could barely find time to shower. Assil opened a 105-seat upscale restaurant. “She’s a superhuman,” our server explained, setting down a woven basket of puffy, piping-hot, pita. Tearing into it, I agree. ', 'Moreover: she’s a talented chef. Born and raised in suburban Boston by a Syrian father and Palestinian mother, she has made it her mission to make her family’s cuisine seen, enhancing many Americans’ idea of casual Middle Eastern fare beyond the reductive falafel-shawarma realm. (Although Reem’s does make a mean falafel sandwich. It’s wrapped in blistered flatbread with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and mint — all dripping with a messy green swirl of spicy zhoug and super-garlicky tahini that, quite literally, stayed with me for days.)', ' You won’t find falafel on the lunch or dinner menu at Dyafa. There isn’t much overlap with the bakery at all, actually, other than a couple of mezzes, the mana’eesh, and that dreamy-creamy labneh. You’ll pay a bit more here, where diners watch sailboats bobbing in the bay instead of BART trains rolling by. At Dyafa, for example, the milky-white mound of labneh is served in gorgeous, ceramic bowls, handmade by potters in Jerusalem. Looking like a savory Dairy Queen blizzard, it’s hollowed and heaped with wisps of radish, flowering coriander, and the crunch of sugar snap peas. Meanwhile, at $16, the hummus is actually twice the price of Reem’s, but for good reason: It comes flecked with cured sumac and sunken with meaty, crisped hunks of spiced lamb. ', 'If Reem’s fare is considered everyday “Arabic street food”, the food at Dyafa, which means “hospitality,” is a family-style feast: The kind where you just keep eating. I devoured certain share plates all by myself. Like the loubieh, a wild tangle of yellow and green summer beans dressed in a chunky sauce of serrano-spiked roasted tomatoes and crumbs of toasted pita. And the kibbeh nayyeh, a fleshy, Lebanese-style mash of raw lamb bound by bulgur, and emboldened by lemon zest, baharat, and the heat of burnt cinnamon. It’s a tartare with flavor as flamboyant as the hot-pink triangles of pickled turnips scattered on top. ', 'Meanwhile, the cocktails, from beverage director Aaron Paul, are as colorful as the restaurant’s jewel-toned chair cushions. Cocktails with ingredients like medjool dates and Greek yogurt and za’atar. Cocktails, like the Wattani Habibi, a Gatorade-yellow, Negroni-like number served up with white vermouth. And the Mexi-Pali, a tall, fluorescent fuchsia, tequila-, beet-, and tamarind-infused marvel. Cocktails that, on all three visits, took so long to arrive that I thought they might never come.', 'By the time our server presents our suhoons, or larger plates, we’re already near-stuffed with mezzes, including the batata harra: humble potatoes, twice fried, bronzed and crisped, with cilantro, garlic, aleppo pepper, and a kick of harissa-spiked yogurt sauce. It’s like Lebanon’s answer to patatas bravas, and I loved it. We’d also scarf both a halloumi-and-squash-topped flatbread and an entire basket of pita. Still, we request a second basket, because how can we not? ', 'All of which makes the grand entrance of the shakriyah almost comical. It’s a humongous, halal lamb shank, braised for three or fours in a baharat spice blend; all but its protruding-bone smothered by gremolata, almond slivers, and a garlicky yogurt sauce, sitting pretty in a mushy, casserole-like tub of Arabic rice. The meat tears easily off the bone, but I find it too cinnamon-y sweet to eat. Which is probably for the best, really, given how full I am. ', 'The lamb leaves me longing for the sharper, more distinctive flavors of the mezze. So do the mostly muted flavors in three of the other four main dishes. The samaka harra, a whole roasted rock cod, is the highlight, arched and aglitter with ground chiles, it’s surprisingly mild flavor offset by a bright, lemony cucumber-bulgur salad. The mjusakhan, chunks of tangy, sumac-tinged chicken confit topped with pickled onion and shreds of purple cabbage, is nourishing and visually arresting, but overall tastes less impressive than it looks: It comes plopped in the center of a yet another circle of unleavened bread, a giant floppy disk called markook — so plan ahead and dial back your cries for “More, pita please!” accordingly. ', 'And if you’re a Reem’s regular, perhaps, adjust your expectations too. Whereas the bakery feels deeply personal, Dyafa feels more Daniel Patterson. The airy space housed his failing Haven before he and Assil joined forces to open this restaurant, and despite Arabic tunes and pretty terracotta floor tiling, it still looks much the same. ', 'Without a provocative mural or posters promoting prison strikes, the decor at Dyafa is tamer, more typical. There’s the go-to walnut wood, leafy plants, and rattan light fixtures. A small square “SANCTUARY RESTAURANT” sticker stuck by the front door is the only sign of our highly charged times — a symbol more meaningful than any peeling Zagat or owl-eyed TripAdvisor accolade. ', 'Assil’s ideals seep into her hiring philosophy: Experience isn’t necessary, she says, genuine warmth is. When it comes to the latter, she has nailed it. The servers’ training, perhaps, not so much: I witnessed broken glasses, unfilled water glasses, long-empty un-cleared cocktail glasses, chipped plates, rushed plates, and sauce-streaked-never-exchanged plates. On one night, our server delivered the bill without a “Would you like to see the dessert menu?” ', 'But I wasn’t too bothered by any of the slip ups, at least not on the two balmy nights that we showed up without a reservation and were seated outside. I don’t know if was the novelty of the outdoors for this Fogust-chilled San Franciscan, but I much preferred it to the standard decor in doors. Faint music trickled out from inside. The glowing fireball of the setting sun illuminated our faces. We drank and dipped, swiping our pita left and right, until our shared mezze bowls were scraped clean.  ', 'Everyone around us — servers, strangers — were chatty and happy, easygoing and energized, bound by the abundance of food before us. And when our server cleans off the table by pinching our bits of spilled food with her fingers, like a parent, I get a tingling of that feeling Assil is after: There’s indeed a kind of at-home comfort to Dyafa. Even if it’s not your home. As one of my dinner guests remarked, several dishes were “just like Grandma makes for Shabbat.” But that’s Assil’s point — there’s common ground to be found.

60,"['The new a la carte bar menu brings accessibility back to David Chang’s experimental fine dining flagship', 'Momofuku Ko, the two-Michelin-starred jewel of David Chang’s empire, has always peppered its tastings with high-wire whimsy, from teetering trout roe mille-feuilles to basil-seed lily ponds to shavings of frozen foie gras that melt like snowflakes. And yet in 2018, the restaurant’s most Matrix-like mind-bender of a dish is somehow the humble chicken drumstick. ', 'The chicken is fried four times, at rigorous two-minute intervals, in a slurry of cornstarch, flour, vodka, and beer. It is re-battered in between each fry, and finished with a brushing of mirin, yuzu, and green Tabasco. What the chef places in front of you, on a gray ceramic plate, isn’t so much a normal drumstick as it is a puffy, golden, Yogi-Bear-picnic-basket fantasy of what a chicken wing should look like. ', 'The drumstick is cold. This is by design. Generations of humans have enjoyed chilled fried chicken in more familiar environs — one thinks of a Sunday picnic in a grassy park — but it’s hard to think of a refrigerator bird with this much crunch. The firm skin shatters like a Butterfinger bar, while the sweet-spicy-citrusy glaze, an American take on yuzu kosho, counteracts all the salty fats of the meat. ', 'Normally, the price of a meal at Ko is $255, reservations only. The quadruple-fried wing, however, is only available in Ko’s new a la carte bar room, where it sells for just $7, walk-ins only.', 'Ten years ago, as the U.S. economy slipped into its longest downward spiral since World War II, Chang opened the original Ko on First Avenue. With an $85 menu, it felt like a permanent recession special of a restaurant — at least by fancypants standards. The chef, barely 30, was already a legend for redefining ambitious American cuisine as affordable, Asian-accented small plates at his nearby Ssäm Bar. ', 'But Ko’s nose-thumbing at the haute establishment was even bolder. Everything about the place was (classically) wrong: the cramped counter seating, the expletive-spewing chefs, the alt-rock soundtrack, the fried McDonald’s-style apple pies, the online-only reservations. It felt as if the Ko revolution would democratize fine dining forever. ', 'It would not. In fact, there’s never been a worse time in the past decade to seek out accessible luxury than now. ', 'New York is still one of the U.S.’s culinary capitals, but the Changian notion of democratized fine dining has proved illusory. Once-approachable tasting joints (Aska, Brooklyn Fare, Atera) have skyrocketed into the upper stratosphere of prices. Major Food Group pivoted from $50 set menus at Torrisi Italian Specialties (RIP) to power spots so expensive they don’t even publish the prices online. And what’s replacing those more reasonable-ish venues? Nothing, really; dinner at any one of the city’s dozen or so new omakase joints will easily run $350-plus per person.', 'Momofuku Ko, in turn, relocated to a larger space off the Bowery, adopted more refined dishes (RIP fried apple pies), and eventually started charging roughly $1,000 for a wine-paired dinner for two. I awarded it four stars in 2015; it’s without question one of the city’s great restaurants. But in this rich person’s playland that is contemporary New York, Ko’s evolution meant that cash-strapped gourmands had lost a sanctuary.', 'Ko’s bar room, which opened in February, marks the return of that sanctuary.', 'There are 15 table seats, a small island for stand-up cocktailing, hefty soundproofing, and the centerpiece, a blonde eight-seat bar. You’ll want to sit at that bar, as it overlooks the new test kitchen, where chef Sean Gray and others glaze duck pies with painter’s brushes and grill crepes over the binchotan. ', 'The crepe ($8) is made from from the same sourdough starter that fuels the bread service in the main room. Here, it imparts the savory pastry with such a remarkable tang it recalls the acidity of injera. The grilling gives it a distinct sweetness and a chew not dissimilar to a fruit roll-up, while a brushing of aged butter adds a marked cheesy funk. There is no other bread course in the city like it. ', 'It’s also hard to think of a New York dish comparable to the tandoori firefly squid. Cooks sear the torpedo-shaped creatures — they look like miniaturized beasts from a Guillermo del Toro flick — in a blend of coriander, paprika, garlic, onions, and soy. They exhibit a handsome bronze hue and pack the flavors of smoke and brine — with a bit of squishiness thanks to their oceanic guts. Equally stunning is the chaud-froid of shrimp. Gray rips the shells off of raw spot prawns, dredges the slithery bodies through a sambal-spiked gelee, then tops them off with the fried head, a warm, crunchy counterpoint to all the cool crustacean creaminess.', 'Pinning down precisely what strain of global eclecticism a Momofuku restaurant specializes in is a particular type of modern trivia question. At the moment, chef Gray’s food is modern American-French-Japanese with nods to South and Southeast Asia, all served in a style that’s more refined and a touch more expensive than Ssäm Bar. Most dishes on the 16-item menu, written in hand in a cute little notebook, are under $35. That’s not a bad price for what’s nearly a four-star meal.', 'The team at Ko built the bar room to “create a space for tasting-menu research and development,” per its website. That’s a heck of a mission statement; fine dining empires typically begin their innovations in more upscale environs, only later letting them trickle down to the masses. Grant Achatz’s famous black-truffle explosion, now available for $18 in the Time Warner Center, started as a bite at the $500-per-person Alinea. And Wolfgang Puck’s smoked-salmon pizza, not an uncommon sight at his airport kiosks, started its lifespan at his once uber-exclusive Spago.', 'So in a world where culinary experimentation can command caviar-like markups, it’s refreshing to know that the cheaper half of Ko is inspiring the more expensive half. That’s all the more appropriate for a restaurant group like Momofuku, which started slinging ramen before it launched a tasting-menu venue, rather than the other way around.', 'One night at Ko’s bar, halibut arrived in a dashi with soybeans. Garnishing the fillet was a confit of the fish’s own skin and cheeks, cooked down with pepperoncini and sumac. The chewy bits were mahogany in color and packed the smoky, umami richness of reconstituted bonito flakes. A few nights later the same fish came as a round cake, laced with verdant chiles and slathered in a cauliflower porridge that somehow tasted like daikon. ', 'Gray says he might adapt both dishes for the tasting — perhaps serving the cake next to the dashi alone, with the confit as a condiment. This is what makes the bar at Ko so damn fascinating: It gives diners a peek into the restaurant’s works in progress, near-blockbusters, and potential failures, without pledging one’s rent check to the full menu. ', 'And then there are the more straightforward dishes: an endive and frisee salad as boring as any other, a competent blend of foie gras and duck in puff pastry ($45), and a charcoal-grilled strip loin ($34) packing as much dry-aged tang as steakhouse versions costing twice as much.', 'Guests of the main dining room, for now, will miss out on some distinctly thrilling bar fare, like the mandarin tart tatin, with shavings of sharp cheddar that counteract the bitter oranges, as well as the Naked Pruner cheesecake, an egg white-heightened loaf that melts on the tongue like the venue’s famous foie gras. ', 'The bar might not be the four-star side of Ko — service can be a touch uneven here — but the fact that the walk-in half of the restaurant is the more exciting half suggests that Chang and Gray remain committed to Momofuku’s iconoclastic, accessible roots. Rock on.', 'Cost: All but two dishes at $31 or under, service included. The two exceptions: $45 duck pie and $100 caviar (50 grams, a good deal).\xa0', 'Sample dishes: Sourdough crepe, cold fried chicken, firefly squid, dry-aged strip loin, spicy pickled daikon and radish, Japanese cheesecake', 'Bonus tip: The bar opens at 3 p.m., if you’re looking for a late lunch! Also note that the cocktail bar in the formal dining room has been removed; the shorter prix-fixe bar menu has been eliminated as well.']"
61,"['The first international outpost of Nepal chain Bajeko Sekuwa arrives with funky mutton and fatty wild boar', 'New Yorkers are already familiar with a wealth of barbecue traditions — and their associated starches. Eat Jamaican jerk chicken at Peppa’s and expect a sweet doughnut called festival. Texas barbecues like Hill Country dole out slices of white supermarket bread, while in Uzbek kebab joints like Cheburechnaya, the parabolic cracker-thin flatbread noni toki will probably make an appearance. So you shouldn’t be shocked when your Nepalese barbecue rolls in on a bed of puffed rice.', 'Located right on Queens Boulevard, the main drag of Sunnyside, Bajeko Sekuwa (“Grandfather’s Barbecue”) is the first international branch of a restaurant originating in the mountainous republic of Nepal, sandwiched between India and Tibet. The chain traces its roots to a grilled meat shack that opened 38 years ago near the Kathmandu airport. It attracted enthusiastic customers — according to the website — but also flocks of crows that proved such a nuisance to aviation that the shack had to be moved.', 'Dinanath Bhandari founded the company that’s now run by his son Chetan, a chain that currently comprises 13 restaurants in Nepal, as well as our own orphan branch, where Nepalese-born Surendra Rayamajhi is chef. The dining room sports a peaked ceiling, rustic wood rafters, and a lighting motif that suggests glowing village windows. A bar at the end dispenses cocktails, wine, and beer, while a native kitchen is mocked up by the front door. On top of the wood hearth a fosi (narrow-mouthed copper pot) and a karahi (wok-like cooking vessel) are perched.', 'Single item servings of barbecue known as sekuwas ($9.95 to $14.95) form the crux of the menu. As mentioned previously, these charcoal-grilled meats are served on puffed rice, which absorbs the grease and juices. They’re sided with a small undressed salad and a few pieces of root-vegetable achar (pickle). Due to agricultural conditions and a nomadic past, vegetables remain limited in Nepalese cuisine.', 'Your barbecue choices are confined to chicken, goat, hyakula (mutton), and bandel (wild boar). Pick any of the last three. One of the most appealing features of Bajeko Sekuwa is that it presents meats that are underexposed here. Yes, the mutton is as funky as you might wish, while the boar favors fatty belly meat, almost tasting like pig but not quite. (The menu also offers the same boar in steamed form with seasoned salt and a chile dip. Skip it.) Sadly, the actual Nepalese barbecue part of Bajeko Sekuwa’s menu is small compared to the rest of the menu.', 'The balance of the bill of fare falls into three categories, including distinctively Nepalese dishes, Indian-Chinese offerings, and food from northern India. The latter includes tandoori selections that, I suppose, might be considered part of the restaurant’s barbecue mission. Into this category fall pink and slightly charred tiger prawns, a delectable deal at $15.95 for seven. The usual tandoori chicken and its clay pit pals are also provided.', 'Bajeko Sekuwa distinguishes itself from the dozen or so Nepalese cafes in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst by being more meat oriented. Nevertheless, a handful of starchier dishes are available, which are the main focus of most Himalayan menus in Queens. These include the wonderful bhatmas sandheko ($5.95) — crunchy fried soybeans tossed with scallions, garlic, and lemon juice to make one of the world’s best bar snacks. And yes, there are momos like those that fly from carts near the Jackson Heights subway stop.', 'Momo fillings run to vegetables, chicken, and goat, and one should spring for the optional chile sauce that forms their perfect accompaniment. But even better is jhol momo ($7.95 to $11.95), which immerses the thick-skinned dumplings in a sesame soup something like tahini. It’s so good, you’ll lap up the remaining liquid. But the thukpa are a big disappointment. Instead of the usual ragged homemade noodles, which look like they were torn by a cook in a hurry, this restaurant’s version seems like overcooked spaghetti.', 'Yes, Bajeko Sekuwa is a place where you should head for the unusual stuff. The bone soup ($5.95) is a delight, resembling the bone broth so newly popular in Greenwich Village, only loaded with goat pieces. “Tauko fry” is a catalog of goat face parts that will leave you trying to distinguish ear, cheek, and lip. (The same assortment is less beguiling in its boiled form.) Avoid the Indian-Chinese food. Dishes like chow mein and fried rice are better at the local Chinese carryout, so go for the gingery goat biryani ($13.95) instead.', 'While the Indian fare like palak paneer and chana masala make some the menu’s tastier vegetarian options, one is better off getting those things in one of the Punjabi steam table joints that dot the neighborhood. Although, come to think of it, the best thing on the menu, in addition to the barbecue on puffed rice, is an Indian regional dish.', 'Utilizing a creative spelling, Bengoli fish curry ($14.95) originates in the Bengal region of India and Bangladesh, a stunning mince of freshwater fish in a supremely creamy sauce of mustard oil, onions, and tomatoes. And that mustard oil — a signal ingredient in Nepalese cooking — leaves an enjoyable tingle in your throat with every swallow.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including fried soybeans, Bengoli fish curry, and goat sekuwa, plus two beers, including tax but not tip, $50', 'Sample dishes: Chireko salad (carrot, daikon, and cucumber crudité), chicken biryani, haas ko choila (chargilled duck), and hyakula sekuwa (mutton barbecue)', 'What to drink: European or American beers (selection varies, sometimes there is Singaporean Tiger Beer), mango lassi, or plain tap water', 'Bonus tips: You may be tempted to use this place as an Indian restaurant, since the renditions of Punjabi dishes and tandoori meats and vegetables are up to par. But eating the specifically Nepalese stuff is more rewarding. The restaurant is particularly adept at entertaining offal lovers and big groups.']"
62,"['The East Village Chinese crawfish boil is a fiery, messy crustacean celebration', 'Within view of Cooper Union, across from a Ukrainian church, and down the block from McSorley’s Old Ale House, New Yorkers gather for a nightly festival of shirt-staining shellfish. ', 'This is Le Sia, where Dungeness crabs, their black eyes peering over a cast-iron skillet, sit in a heady garlic and oyster sauce. Crimson lobsters, with claws bigger than human hands, sop up a gravy of tingly Sichuan peppercorns. And scarlet crawfish, at least 15 per pot, absorb a blend of pickled Thai chile juices. Waiters take by-the-pound orders via iPad, and the kitchen sends out the platters in 10 minutes or less, leaving beer-swigging patrons to gnaw on errant maritime appendages as Destiny’s Child plays in the background. Life is good. And affordable.', 'Ordering a collection of shellfish is a frighteningly easy way to burn through a wad of cash in New York. Multi-tiered fruits de mer platters run up to $170 at Balthazar; Catch in the Meatpacking District charges $92 for king crab; and Oriental Garden commands dizzying prices for elegant preparations of crystal crab or geoduck. But the packed Le Sia asks just $15 for a pound of crawfish, $30 for whole lobsters, and $5 more for Dungeness. An entire dinner for two will doubtfully cost more than $100 after tax and tip.', 'Le Sia, a surprisingly accessible seafood spot, translates as “Happy Prawn.” The Mandarin sia, or xia, also hints at the word for crawfish, xiaolongxia, the restaurant’s speciality. The bottom-feeding crustaceans, sometimes known as mountain lobsters, crawdads, yabbies, or mudbugs, have been part of Gulf Coast Cajun cuisine for centuries, but are still relatively new to the China; they were brought from the States through Japan as food for bullfrogs in the 1920s. And while crawfish were once the bane of regional rice farmers, they have become, largely over the past few decades, part of a multibillion-dollar industry that employs over 5 million, primarily in the Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangsu provinces. ', 'The Chinese are now the world’s largest producers, and possibly consumers, of crawfish.', 'Cooks at Le Sia prepare the xiaolongxia in the typical mainland fashion, boiling the creatures in aromatic broth before wok-frying them in one of six sauces, the most famous of which is “13 flavors.” Supposedly developed in the 1990s in Xuyi, where there’s an entire museum dedicated to crawfish, the sauce involves an umami-rich blend of clove, star anise, angelica dahurica, nutmeg, ginger, fennel, black cardamom, Sichuan peppercorn, dried tangerine peel, cinnamon, and galangal. The hodgepodge of spices are used to fortify a shellfish stock that’s cooked until it’s as dark and flavorful as the brown goo that spills out of a scorched shrimp head.', 'Patrons don plastic gloves (don’t even bother with chopsticks) and black bibs (which will save your shirts, not your pants). They rip the crustaceans in two, push out the sweet tail meat with their thumbs, and slurp up the heady, spicy juices from the thorax. Gloves are licked, noses are blown, and chile-triggered sinuses are cleared. The Financial Times reported last year that this style of crawfish eating was highly social because it effectively prevented people from checking their phones; I’m embarrassed to say it didn’t stop me or anyone else in the room from doing precisely that.', 'Le Sia is the brainchild of debut restaurateurs Tina Chen and Yang Liu, as well as chef Zac Zheng, who previously worked at the spendy Peking duck chain DaDong. Their goal was to serve the crawfish they grew up with in their native China, though they’re also filling in a larger New York gastronomic gap; American crawfish boils aren’t in high supply in the city, be they of the lean Louisiana variety or the Viet-Cajun garlic-butter-lemongrass style popular in Houston. ', 'It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to name Le Sia one of the most exhilarating places to eat shellfish in the Big Apple.', 'The setting is simple: a single rectangle of a room with wood-paneled floors, a brick wall, metal stools, and a few firm leather booths. Large shellfish platters sit on most tables; smart guests supplement those feasts with grilled skewers, from chewy five-spice-dusted squid legs to crispy chitlins to beef tendon as soft as gummy bears to cumin-laced balls of juicy, fatty lamb. ', 'In deference to the mudbug traditions of the Gulf Coast, there’s also a crawfish jambalaya — really a perfectly greasy fried rice, studded with bits of sweet tail meat. The grains are best dunked in one of the boil sauces, letting the rice act as a conveyance mechanism for all the dark, drippy fats.', 'The founders plan on opening additional locations in Midtown and near Columbia, though there’s something fitting about a flagship on Seventh Street near Third Avenue. There’s long been an abundance of East Asian restaurants in the East Village, from Sichuan spots to Korean wing joints to ramen shacks. Still, the steady stream of contemporary Chinese restaurants constitutes an important culinary reality: Young operators from the PRC and Taiwan are using the East Village as a testing ground for introducing Manhattanites to (and reminding expatriates of) the harder-to-find specialties of their respective homelands. I’m thinking of the cold skin noodles of X’ian Famous Foods, the fiery dry pots of Mala Project, the Yunnanese mixian soups of Little Tong, and now, the messy seafood boils of Le Sia.', 'The significance of these venues can’t be underestimated. As larger restaurant groups throughout the city continue to spawn overpriced French-Italian-American copycats, smaller-scale restaurateurs of Chinese descent are advancing a more exigent cause: They’re ensuring that the East Village, which gave birth to Momofuku, Prune, and other great venues over a decade ago, remains one of the most vital, unique, and diverse places to eat in Manhattan.', 'Here’s a quick guide on what to order: Start with skewers, though keep in mind they might arrive either before, during, or after the boils. For respite from the spicy shellfish, consider a side of cool mung bean noodles, sauced with the traditional blend of salty (and mild) chiles, or a clean bowl of tomato soup, with little globules of dough and egg floating about. ', 'As for the boils, keep in mind that the crawfish require a lot of work for not a whole lot of nourishment.  Shrimp offer a more approachable head-sucking experience, with easier access to a heftier quantity of flesh. Snow crab, in turn, is filled with an abundance of soft, sugary insides — the proper foil for Le Sia’s gently bitter and powerfully aromatic garlic sauce. Best of all is the Dungeness crab, teeming with meat as soft as cotton and packing a deep oceanic tang; it stands alone, but becomes otherworldly when drenched in the incendiary 13 flavors gravy.', 'The individual sauces, which can be matched with any shellfish, are all offered at four different levels of heat. Spicy, the third hottest, should be tolerable for most diners, while “fire” provides just enough kick to induce a touch of extra beer drinking.', 'Waiters consistently drop the check before patrons can ask for dessert; that’s just as well, since the only sweets are outsourced green tea, vanilla, or red bean ice cream. And quite frankly, there’s something to be said for giving up one’s table to make room for the throngs waiting up front. Let the people have their xiaolongxia!', 'Cost: Crawfish or shrimp at $15 per pound, snow crab legs at $25 per pound, lobsters at $30 each, whole Dungeness crab at $35. Seafood and meat skewers are priced at $1.50 to $3.', 'Sample dishes: Assorted grilled skewers (lamb, beef, tendon, chitlin, squid feet, chicken wings, pork belly), mung bean jelly, dough drop soup, spicy seafood boils by the pound, fried breadsticks, fried dough twists.', 'Bonus tip: Crawfish are a seasonal crustacean; Le Sia imports them live from Louisiana from January to July, then switches to California specimens until October, after which they’ll use frozen ones from Spain. Plan your visit accordingly!']"
63,"['Sacramento Street isn’t like other streets in San Francisco. It’s not undergoing transformation or gentrification or condo-ification. Which means, unlike most everywhere else in this ever-changing city, it’s more or less static. A tony time warp, where the same women still take their finest threads to Peninou for French cleaning; where the same mind-boggling mansions still seemingly occupy entire blocks; and where the same decades-old restaurants — like Osteria, Magic Flute, Garibaldi’s — still draw a steady, hyper-local crowd. Sprawling, luxurious Spruce, with its white tablecloths and throne-like saddle-leather chairs, holds claim as the go-to, see-and-be-seen night out in this neighborhood, and has ever since it opened back in 2007. ', 'So the arrival of Sorrel, a buzzy but comparatively low-key Cal-Italian restaurant, is big news around here. If you can call a place run by a Quince alum with $46 wagyu and golden-wrapped toilet paper in the restroom low key. In a neighborhood where home prices soar into the multimillions, I guess you can. Pricey restaurants are a San Francisco epidemic these days — and in Presidio Heights, a $78 duck-for-two is just another Tuesday night out. Which is to say: Sorrel is a neighborhood restaurant befitting its neighborhood. ', 'On a recent weeknight, all 50 seats were filled with mostly beautiful middle-aged couples, grandfatherly men in blazers, and a communal table of meticulously-coiffed blondes. Everyone looked as instantly at home here as Sorrel itself. The restaurant slid right into the rectangular space formerly occupied by Nico, which was a Michelin-starred, five-course, prix-fixe affair. (After just three years, it recently relocated to Jackson Square.)', 'Now almost-29-year-old chef Alex Hong —in a white t-shirt, his longish, wavy hair curled around his ears — is arguably the youngest person in the place. He commands the partially open kitchen with the confidence and studiousness of a Culinary Institute of America graduate trained under Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Still, he lacks pretension in the way that only a Boulder-born guy who spent the last four years running a weekly pop-up restaurant can.', 'He has set the right tone. It’s a rare combination: unaffected service paired with serious, painstakingly correct food. The staff is professional, even passionate, yet also refreshingly real. ', '“I’d fight someone over the scorza di fagioli,” said our peppy, fast-talking server when we asked her which of Hong’s half-dozen pastas was her favorite. The dish comes in a pole bean pesto with favas, ramps, and English peas. Chewy and bright, with a touch of Meyer lemon, it’s my favorite, too. The orecchiette with broccoli di ciccio in a Calabrian chili-spiked pork sausage sugo is a close second — albeit a more predictable dish.', 'Predictability is a bit of a thorn in the flowery, super-seasonal menu. “This is my second arugula-and-stone fruit salad of the day,” said my sister, visiting from back east. It was, however, the fresher arugula and sweeter stone fruit salad of the day. There were the usual elegantly springy suspects, too: chilled pea soup, porcini risotto, lamb tartare, and a salmon crudo. ', 'Indeed, as is the blooming trend these days, nasturtium adorned them all, as if a colorful bouquet had been tossed into the air in the kitchen. The petals are as pretty as the presentation, but otherwise do little to the enhance the muted, at times uneven, flavors of Hong’s menu. ', 'The California king crudo was not “mind-blowing” as the server overpromised. Dragging my salmon slab through a thin puddle of buttermilk didn’t add much. Although I appreciate the salty, succulent-like crunch of agretti — an Italian herb whose green fronds were tucked into the thinly sliced raw salmon — the dish was still just another salmon crudo in what’s become a sea of salmon crudos in San Francisco. ', 'The spring lamb tartare, though, is uniquely itself. A diced, hand-molded mound of mild, citrus-kissed meat, hiding a boquerones-whisked mayonnaise and bordered by what looks like a multihued pillbox of pine nuts, black sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, and salty-sweet sunny-yellow gratings of cured egg yolk. We were told to crumble the accompanying “everything” lace cracker over the top and mix it all together. A lively mash of textures and tastes‚ it was like the tea leaf salad of tartare — and I scraped every last bit from its hefty, ceramic black plate.', 'The “foie gras parfait,” cured in cognac and maderida and blended with gelatin, was creamy, almost airy, and served with a toasted triangle of brioche. Without that rich, fatty punch, it failed to satisfy like foie — or any $24 starter— should, and did little other than leave me wondering: Why, with its sugar-torched, fork-shattering top, wasn’t it dubbed a “crème brulee” instead? ', 'The risotto, too, isn’t luxurious the way risotto traditionalists want it to be. It is woodsy, oddly almost al dente, toasted to the point where you can discern each and every kernel. Buried beneath is a ball of barely-there burrata and raw porcini shavings are showered on top along with one meaty, roasted mushroom slab. It’s a a beautiful but under-seasoned bowl of beige scattered with about as many petals as a bride’s aisle.

A clean, briny Washington Chelsea gem, accompanied by a namesake sorrel ice, and capped in a coin of Asian pear, which gives it a faint crunch. It’s a remarkably well-groomed oyster — its edges supersmooth, its muscle expertly cut. I wanted a dozen more. ', 'Unfortunately, on one night, the stellar service slipped. The oyster arrived after the fried soft-shell crab starter — even though I’d ordered it with my “Sorrel,” which is their spin on a negroni, made with rhubarb. ', '“Oysters are to start!,” my companion and I griped. And then acknowledged the ridiculousness of San Francisco, where complaining about a belated $4.50 oyster is something we do.', 'But we raved our way through that crab. A playful starter with a delicate, fiery crunch, it arrives with legs splayed like a little swimmer holding an imperfect handstand in a pool of gribiche. The sauce is like an extra-chunky tartare, enlivened by capers and sweet gherkins and not shy with its shallots.', 'Meanwhile, the dry-aged duck-for-two is a bronzed, beautiful bundle, swaddled in its own honey-lacquered skin and adorned with a bushy purple artichoke flower. The server presents it in its pan, like a proud parent, then whisks it away to prepare it for dinner. When the duck returns, it’s carved into fat, rosy-pink slices, bejeweled with Sicilian pistachios, and sealed by a thin, crisp layer of fat that melts like magic.', 'On our visit, Hong himself emerged to spoon a jus of sticky, burgundy-red Balaton cherries from a small saucepan and then disappeared back into the open kitchen in the rear. He makes a point to stop by every table — not for long, and not to chit-chat, just perhaps to show he cares.  ', 'It’s clear he does. And much of the experience works well. As Hong continues to settle into his first permanent space, he’s certainly a chef to watch. ', 'But as I settled in, I felt like I could be at any upscale-seasonal restaurant in San Francisco: from the wooden communal table, to the dangling glass globe lights, to the leafy ficus trees, to the perfectly pleasant chilled pea soup.', 'One Friday night, though, when we walked in and scored two just-vacated stools at the small, white marble bar, I felt a distinct sense of place. These are by far the best seats in the house. From the bar topped with a gorgeous green swirl of Amazonia quartzite, I watched a steady stream of Range Rovers and Teslas roll in. And I remembered exactly where I was: in one of San Francisco’s wealthiest enclaves, eating at a restaurant as safe and subdued as its street.  ', 'It’s not all Hong’s fault — he’s like a straight-A student — but to stand out in this talent-saturated town requires taking risks, which is something too few rising chefs are willing to do in San Francisco these days. If Sorrel were, say, in an equally affluent suburb, or somewhere less competitive, it would likely be a big deal. But given the costs of running a restaurant around here — and on Sacramento Street especially — it’s seemingly safer to cater to customers rather than challenge them. Ultimately, Hong’s food is like its neighborhood: serene and lovely and a little too quiet to draw a cross-town crowd.

But if you delve into the entrees, wine, and dessert, you’ll quickly be in the $200 range before tax and tip.', 'What to eat: Oysters, lamb tartare, soft-shell crab, scorza di fagioli, dry-aged duck for two; the “strawberries and rhubarb” dessert with elderflower cream was a lively, bright-red hodgepodge of textures and temperatures.', 'What to drink: Start with a Sorrel cocktail.

64,"['The Lower East Side kaiseki spot packs in the extravagances, but little punch', 'Caviar is expensive. But it’s also easy. It doesn’t need to be deveined and pushed through a tamis like foie gras. It doesn’t benefit from a deft tableside shaving over wood-fired pizza like with truffles. The lightly-salted roe of a mature sturgeon simply needs to be opened like a can of sardines and consumed. ', 'The most meaningful thing a chef typically does to caviar is mark it up. That’s not to say there’s no place for it in restaurants, but almost every high-end spot that’s wowed me with a composed caviar course has also gutted me with an experiment gone awry, often involving a modicum of fish eggs acting as an expensive form of salt. ', 'Still, there are impressive exceptions. One of them is Uchu, a kaiseki spot on the Lower East Side with a penchant for, and perhaps overreliance on, classic luxuries like truffles and wagyu. About halfway through dinner, chef Samuel Clonts, late of Brooklyn Fare, steps behind the black walnut bar with enough osetra caviar to trade in for a Rolex. He takes a fat quenelle of roe, lies it atop a mound of vinegar-laced rice, wraps it in toasted nori, and hands it to you.', 'Osetra caviar nearly spills out of the completed hand roll.', 'The emerald green eggs shimmer under the soft lighting; they practically spill over the side like a dripping ice cream cone. The first bite or so is cool and clean, the essence of the ocean encapsulated into firm pearls. As you work down the roll, the roe becomes softer and oilier, the crisp nori and warm rice intensifying the briny notes. ', 'The key here is balance. So many caviars can assault the palate with salt or fade into buttery nothingness. Clonts brilliantly chooses a variety that works well mid-meal. This is all the more impressive since the preparation contains a whopping 25-30 grams of roe, a portion that could easily command $150 as an individual dish. Here it comes part of a $200, service-included, twelve-course tasting. ', 'If only the rest of the feast were as compelling.', 'Uchu, located just a block and a half south of Houston on a quiet stretch of Eldridge, houses two separate venues, serving two different menus. Operators generally employ these spilt-style restaurants to maximize accessibility. Danny Meyer perfected this style at The Modern and Gramercy Tavern, placing a more casual, a la carte room next to a fancier, set menu space. But at oligarch-inclined Uchu, the eight-seat kaiseki room actually is the more affordable spot. The front room features $300 tastings by Eiji Ichimura, a chef famous for stacking multiple slices of fatty toro on top of one another in a single piece of nigiri. ', 'Owner Derek Feldman (who also runs Sushi on Jones), is clearly riding on the city’s prevailing luxury zeitgeist; the past two years have seen an unprecedented spate of new restaurants dedicated to Japanese cuisine in its most rarefied forms. These small, expensive, lit-for-Instagram venues represent a shift in the fine dining landscape, possibly reflecting a moneyed class who’d prefer a lighter style of gastronomy than what’s being served at the city’s European-American tasting palaces or haute steakhouses. ', 'Even the sturdiest eater could only handle a gut-busting meal at Per Se every so often, but one could eat at Ginza Onodera, the obscenely expensive temple to raw fish, a few times a week and be none the worse off. ', 'This review will focus on Uchu’s more creative kaiseki space. Assessing the technical nuances of high-end sushi spots, which largely serve similar products, can at times feel like comparing two $500 bottles of Burgundy; maybe one’s objectively better or maybe it’s just a matter of preference, but either way it’s a task that serves a narrower audience. ', 'Also not to be discounted is the fact that Uchu sets itself apart from the larger kaiseki scene in that the setting is essentially a cocktail bar. ', 'Dinner begins when a staffer in a double breasted suit brings over a drinkable amuse, an electric mix of barley sochu, elderflower syrup, yuzu, and Champagne. He pours it into a coupe so light the ounce and a half of liquid feels heavier than the glass itself. ', 'Then the food starts appearing from the kitchen, which is odd because the point of sitting at a counter is to get a peek at the creative and technical process of cooking, watching as chefs contemplate micro-garnishes and turn hamachi fillets into translucent, abstract artwork through impossible knife work. At Uchu, caviar rolling and truffle shavings notwithstanding, diners spend most of the meal looking at a handsome brown wall of whisky bottles, and watching a guy behind the bar make cocktails. He likes to use infuse his drinks with smoke, creating a slightly sweet haze that recalls a nightclub or your buddy who vapes too much. ', 'Clonts kicks off the meal with uni. Sometimes he places it in a glazed ceramic bowl above a layer of tofu and pumpkin — a study in soft textures from the land and sea. On another visit he might lay it above a dice of scallops — a striking contrast of orange urchin and black soy over a white dice of mollusks; it’s as if the mollusks are a bed of ice. ', 'A server arrives with an ornamental jewel box. She removes the top and reveals a few slices of octopus in dashi, floating aside a branch of purple shiso flowers and a potato. The flavors are clean, neutral, and not particularly memorable; it’s the plating that’s more exciting, a high-end boutique’s evocation of a small tidal pool. ', 'This is followed by a single bland bite of eel. Next the kitchen might send out a tempura-fried spanish prawn, the minerally flavors of the Mediterranean juxtaposed against a pool of a sauce of the crustacean’s own head — an elevated riff on katsu curry. ', 'Or instead of the prawn, Clonts might send out a few forgettable slices of fried sweetbread. Inconsistency is an issue here. ', 'And then there is the question of Uchu’s more traditional gourmet fare. In his Letters to a Young Chef, Daniel Boulud wrote that “clientele and imagination determine what ingredients you should buy...It does not all have to be truffles, caviar, and foie gras.” His comment was prescient in that it preceded a decade-plus movement of young chefs redefining and expanding the notion of luxury as we know it, from the faux-shark’s fin soup of Benu, to the lemongrass-flavored ants of Noma, to the green apple taffy helium balloons of Alinea, to the house-made mozzarella of Torrisi. ', 'Clonts, by contrast, is the rare young chef to rely a bit more heavily on traditional extravagences. This should not necessarily surprise: Clonts spent five years at Brooklyn Fare, a French-Japanese spot famous for making those luxuries feel exciting again.', 'Some of those same indulgences don’t pack the same wow factor here. His caviar is outstanding, yes. And there’s no one in the city using golden trout roe the way he is; the chef lies it over a pile of barely set scrambled eggs, two shades of the color yellow, one rich and creamy the other shockingly briny. It’s perfect, until you try it another night and the eggs are overcooked and lack their compelling richness.', 'Or consider the staple meat course, a slice of dry-aged Miyazaki wagyu set between two slices of milk bread. It’s a riff on a dish that famously runs $180 in Tokyo. Here, the bread completely overwhelms the fattiness and seasonings of the beef. It tastes like any steak sandwich. Rice laced with foie gras, the final savory course, has little of the duck liver’s signature richness; the ingredient is more oily than flavorful. The black truffles atop, in turn, lack the earthy complexity they possess elsewhere.', 'The tasting winds down with mandarin sorbet and then a chocolate souffle. They’re both fine. Better are the petits fours — soy caramels whose sweetness are tempered by a stinging Brandy Alexander, a final mini-cocktail to bookend the dinner.', 'For a well-heeled clientele looking for classic, if not particularly inventive weeknight luxuries, this will do. But really, Uchu needs work.', 'Price: $200 for the menu. Beverage pairings are $125; cocktails are $26. Japanese whisky flights available from $45-$195. All prices are service-included; there is no tipping at Uchu.', 'Sample dishes: Uni with scallops, egg with golden trout roe, osetra caviar hand roll, Miyazaki wagyu sandwich, foie gras and black truffle rice pot, chocolate souffle.\xa0']"
65,"['The menu at Szechuan Mountain House is eclectic, creative, and hits more than it misses', 'The original Szechuan Mountain House was one among a raft of modern and more expensive Sichuan restaurants to hit Flushing during the last three years. Eschewing the bursts of red and communal tables of their predecessors, these places flaunted stylish interiors with intimate seating. Some featured rustic elements meant to evoke Chinese villages; others were more East Village-y, with exposed concrete surfaces, deejays, and futuristic light fixtures.', 'Opening on an interior courtyard of a new shopping and hotel complex off Prince Street, Szechuan Mountain House was an instant hit among well-heeled dating couples out for an evening of innovative food in a romantic atmosphere. More recently, a branch daringly opened on St. Marks in the East Village. It grabbed the second-floor space formerly occupied by Grand Sichuan, itself an early advocate of the Sichuan peppercorns that have become ubiquitous in the neighborhood.', 'A stone-clad koi pond and burbling waterfall confronts you upon entering the space. Enclosed bamboo booths trail off into an interior decorated with pottery and other elements, intended to evoke the eponymous mountain retreat. But far from mounting a menu obsessed with the rural or even the urban food of Sichuan, the bill of fare is an eclectic document. In addition to Sichuan standards and Sichuan-themed inventions, it borrows dishes from other regions, leaping from Hunan to Dongbei to Beijing to Hong Kong.', 'Part of the appeal of both Mountain Houses is dramatic platings. Take the first item on a menu: sliced pork belly with chile garlic sauce ($10.95). Looking like thin slices of pale bacon, poached pork belly hangs over a dowel like laundry on a line, interspersed with slices of shaved cucumber. Underneath, a receptacle of chile oil with a wad of mashed garlic is destined for dipping. The contrast of the raw garlic’s pungency and the pork belly’s blandness proves unforgettable, and there’s no better dish for audience participation in town.', 'Sometimes this awesome creativity runs off the rails, though. Less successful is “grilled beef ribs with steamed bun” ($21.95). In actuality, the ribs should be singular and the bun plural, since the dish consists of a single humongous beef rib, somewhat resembling the sort found at the city’s Texas barbecues. Alongside are the kind of folded, steamed bao you now see in nearly every Asian fast food spot. The meat has been cut from the bone, and it’s tough and gristly from being roasted too fast and too hot, which is why the same rib is cooked “low and slow” in barbecues.', 'Also on the novel side are round shrimp fritters sided with sliced spuds, like pink ping pong balls with paddles; and planks of mung bean starch in chile oil and Sichuan peppercorns that wiggle and wobble in a glistening array. There are Sichuan standards, too, including twice-cooked pork, kung pao shrimp, and a ma po tofu ($10.95) that manages to taste better than any other with its silky tofu, earthy fermented bean paste, and daring oiliness. When it wants to, Mountain Szechuan can serve straight-up Sichuan, and it doesn’t stint on the peppercorns.', 'Some Sichuan dishes are charmingly amplified. Peanuts are introduced to the usual ox tongue and tripe in chile oil, adding crunch to the slipperiness. And the full complement of organs and other varieties meats is in full force. Indeed, Szechuan Mountain House should receive plaudits for offering pig intestines and kidneys, fish maws, curdled blood, and the notably-named “strapping cattle throat” ($10.95) — rubbery white strips of integument that’s popular in Chongqing, a major municipality in southwest China. ', 'Perhaps in adherence to the current proclivity for eating lots of vegetables, Szechuan Mountain House has some of the most interesting vegetarian dishes in the city, scattered throughout the menu and not just in the section called “Vegetable.” A brilliant bowl of yellow corn kernels come individually coated with duck egg yolk, giving them a unique texture and making them taste cornier than buttery theater popcorn. The signature fried rice is ramified with mustard greens, while a dish of fried lotus roots and celery provides a spectacular snap that you can hear as diners around the table attack it, with a subtle flavor that you’ll dream of that evening.', 'But the most exciting aspect of Szechuan Mountain House lies in the fact that the daring menu hasn’t been made blander for a perceived East Village audience, mirroring the sorts of experimentation and quest for novelty seen heretofore mainly in the new Sichuan restaurants in Flushing — and presumably, in China itself.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two apps, three shared main dishes, and two beers, plus tax but not tip, $100', 'Sample dishes: Sliced pork belly with chili garlic sauce, spicy mung bean jelly salad, stewed fish filet with pickled cabbage and chili, sliced beef in hot chili oil\xa0 ', 'What to drink: The best beverage is tea, which is presented in an elaborate service. Beer and wine are also available.']"
66,"['With its bountiful steam table, the Richmond Hill restaurant excels at a variety of West Indian treats', 'There’s no better vegetarian snack in the world than doubles. Both singular and plural, “doubles” designates a pair of pliable, puffy bara (small flatbreads) loosely sandwiched around a pungent chickpea curry. The doubles is further flavored, at your request, with tamarind and scotch bonnet sauces — but ask for the latter sparingly, since it’s among the world’s hottest chiles. ', 'The doubles are particularly spectacular at Singh’s Roti Shop & Bar, a restaurant in Richmond Hill, Queens. They’re priced at only $1 apiece, and two make a nice light meal. But they are only one of many culinary wonders to be found there. ', 'Singh’s is located on Liberty Avenue, the bustling commercial center of the neighborhood where there are two dozen eating establishments, including roti shops, Caribbean-Chinese restaurants, Punjabi kebab grills, and bakery snack bars. Greengrocers displaying unusual fruits and vegetables like bitter melon and eddoes (a starchy tuber), sari shops and jewelers, and sellers of Hindu, Muslim, and Christian artifacts also pack the street, and a temple sends its undulant spire skyward, while a white marble mosque is under construction.', 'The area is called Little Guyana, though the owner of Singh’s — who only goes by Mr. Singh — came to the U.S. from Trinidad and intended the restaurant to appeal to people from all West Indian countries. Founded in 1990 and opened here in 1999, the inside looks like a disco and feels like a clubhouse for the neighborhood. A blue neon light runs around the room just under the ceiling, a mirror ball hangs in the middle, and sometimes, just inside the front door a DJ sits, spinning calypso, reggae, soca, and cumbia, with stacks of CDs for sale. On the left separated by a low wall see a glittering full bar, one of the few in the neighborhood. ', 'A whale of a counter displays pastries and savory meals at the end of the room, with four or five attendants standing behind it. On weekends, a line extends to the front door waiting for carryout. The attendants use an unusual system for putting your order together, each one functioning as both cook and counterperson. Each attendant takes a single customer at a time, then zigzags along the counter grabbing pastries, scooping and slicing cutters, stuffing and folding rotis, assembling doubles and bakes, occasionally darting into the kitchen to prepare a dish. ', 'Want a snack to go with a beer or tropical soda? Pick a cutter ($7 to $9), which might be described as an Indo-Caribbean tapa. It might be a small plate of roast pork, garlicky with crisp skin; fried shrimp wontons; Buffalo chicken wings; or length of black pudding, a thick blood sausage that originated in England.', 'Breakfast or lunch might be “bakes,” sandwiches of smoked herring, egg, curried mango, or fried shark, paradoxically made with dough that’s often deep fried rather than baked. Other meals include lo mein and fried rice — available vegetarian, or with shrimp or chicken. Akin to fried rice, but more Indian in outlook, is a chicken pelau. Speaking of chicken, your options are manifold: jerk chicken, fried chicken, and chicken coated with sweet barbecue sauce.', 'But the heart of the menu remains the roti. While in India the word refers to a flatbread, it commonly takes on a different meaning in West Indian countries, where indentured servants were brought from east India to cut sugar cane in Guyana, Trinidad, and Jamaica starting in the 1800s. They needed a carry-able lunch to take into the fields, and the humble roti was turned into one of the world’s earliest wraps by folding it around a filling of goat, chicken, seafood, potatoes, chickpeas, or other vegetables, further seasoned with tamarind and pepper sauces.', 'At Singh’s Roti Shop, a bewildering range of filling choices is available for the roti ($4 to $10), running from the common goat, chicken, and oxtail, to the less common salt cod, tripe, and duck. (The tough duck comes in a dark gravy and doesn’t taste much like duck, but the other fillings are commendable.) The goat is particularly good here, though you have to eat your way around the bones. Indeed, eating judiciously is one feature of the roti that will possibly annoy those who embrace Chicken McNuggets and the concept of effortless eating.', 'Make sure you have a dollop of potato and chickpea curry added to your roti, whatever the main ingredient. Also consider having a vegetable like pumpkin or spinach tossed in, making the field hand’s meal a wonderland of flavors and nutrition. Speaking of nutrition, the wrap-type roti is made with a flatbread known as dhal puri or roti skin, which has crushed yellow split peas between its layers, which adds to the fun.', 'Without going to too-great length, let me also mention a form of roti more suited to communal dining. Called a “buss up shut” (dialect for “busted-up shirt,” referring to its tattered appearance), this roti features a giant flaky flatbread served on the side, so you can break off pieces and pick up bites. A similar arrangement pertains with the $5 breakfast roti, wherein the flatbread is matched with a single serving of vegetable such as eggplant (bigan), string bean, or fried potato (aloo). Whichever type you choose, you can’t go wrong with a roti.', 'Pastries are a whole other game of cricket. Suffice to say some are of English and others of Indian ancestry, as evidenced by names like “fudge” and “jalebi.” Anyway, when it comes to pastries, you’re better off at Sybil’s Bakery, across the street.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one buss up shot, two doubles, a cutter, and two bottles of tropical soda, including tax, $22', 'Sample dishes: goat roti, roast pork cutter, doubles, blood pudding, smoked herring bake\xa0 ', 'What to drink: Tropical sodas made in Guyana and Trinidad are available, in flavors like ginger beer, mango, pineapple, and kola. Beer also available', 'Bonus tip: If you’ve never had a roti before, pick boneless chicken with potato-and-chickpea curry and one spoonful of “pepper” included. Ask the attendant to add a dash of pumpkin, too, for extra flavor and sweetness.']"

The staff here can roast meats better than you, and with a heck of a lot less bling.', 'A small window lets diners peek into the kitchen, where a chef stands behind a plain steel trough filled with smoldering coals. The setup is as pretty as an air-conditioning duct. ', 'Skewers of veal liver, lamb leg, and chicken heart lie inches above the coals, turning various shades of pink, tan, and brown. The chef twirls each kebab, or shashlik, six or seven times to ensure even cooking. He picks up a magenta hair dryer, slowly waving it past the white embers. The spurt of air speeds up the combustion process, akin to the oxygenating effect of a blacksmith’s bellow, only this comes courtesy of a plastic grooming device sold at Duane Reade for $25. ', 'Grilling at Nargis isn’t Instagrammable performance art. It isn’t tableside flambe. It is simple cooking. Affordable cooking. Masterful cooking. The kitchen sends out cumin-laced chicken thighs whose gentle char, preternatural juiciness, and complex notes of smoke recall the delicacies of Tori Shin, a high-end Japanese hangout where a tasting for two easily runs $200. But here, at this months-old sequel to the Sheepshead Bay original, a proper dinner date won’t cost more than $80 after tax and tip.', 'Give credit to chef-owner Boris Bangiyev. In an era when the fates of so many restaurants rise and fall on reviews from the major critics, social-media fervor, high-paid design firms, and photographic virality, this 39-year-old Tashkent native built a loyal following with little of the above. ', 'Here are some of the quirks one might notice while dining at the Park Slope location: a nonworking ATM downstairs, Cheesecake Factory-like headsets worn by the waiters, a 7-foot tall waterfall in the backyard garden, and a soundtrack that always seems to include “What’s Up” by 4 Non Blondes. The restaurant itself is distinguished by its exposed red brick, ornamental carpets, stunning tiles the color of Uzbekistan’s sky-blue minarets, a mural depicting the historic madrasas of Samarkand, and a bar television that shows the ballgame. The bar is often empty. ', 'The real draw of Nargis, of course, is the breathtaking melting-pot cuisine of Uzbekistan, meaty and muttony traditions that balance Turkic, Asian, Persian, and Slavic influences. Cabbage kimchi — Stalin deported thousands of Koreans to Uzbekistan during the Second World War — sparkles with stinging heat and high-voltage acidity. Lagman, the classic Uighur dish, is everything it should be: a crimson lamb soup laced with mild chiles, green beans, peppers, and toothsome hand-pulled noodles. And the pan-Central Asian chuchvara, pan-fried beef dumplings in the shape of tortellini, arrived drenched in heady caramelized onions that alone would merit the $13 price.', 'This type of food isn’t in short supply in New York, where nearly half of the country’s 63,000 Uzbek immigrants live. Rego Park and Forest Hills in Queens are home to Cheburechnaya and scores of other great kosher Central Asian spots — frequented by the Bukharan Jews who fled as the Soviet Union collapsed. Uzbekistan’s Muslims, by contrast, have largely settled in Sheepshead Bay, Kensington, and elsewhere in Brooklyn, thousands of them having availed themselves of the diversity visa program to flee economic hardship at home. Their presence in King’s County paves the way to success for excellent and occasionally halal spots like Tandir Bakery, Emir Palace, and Cafe Kashkar.', 'So what sets Nargis apart? The fact that it’s in Park Slope, an increasingly exorbitant slice of Brooklyn not particularly known for its sizable Russian or Uzbek population. That’s no small matter.', 'Every single table at Nargis in Sheepshead Bay was full on a recent Friday. My companion and I ordered markovcha, the classic Korean-Uzbek salad of shredded carrots doused in vinegar, garlic, and chiles. The kitchen piled the vegetables vertically and generously, as if this were a savory cotton candy, balancing notes of sugar, acid, and heat.', 'Bangiyev opened his flagship in 2007, when the food-writing community was laser focused on the East Village and the ascent of David Chang. Nargis started as a 40-seat spot sandwiched between a florist and a dry cleaners, but as those businesses closed, he expanded, raising the seat count over 150 to meet the booming demand.', 'The chef tells me that non-Russian, non-Uzbek customers were rare in the early days. As the chef himself puts it, “People would say, ‘What the hell is Uzbek food?’” But over the years, that sentiment changed and his clientele diversified. “That gave me the strength to say, ‘Other people besides our own love my food,’ and that’s when I said it’s time to give Park Slope a shot, which I considered the big leagues.”', 'Still, Bangiyev is likely aware that the former Soviet Union’s diverse foodways — or geography — don’t quite carry the same currency among the so-called food elite as regional Mexican or Thai fare. Hence, a bit of unobtrusive but amusing pedagogy begins every meal in Park Slope. Each guest receives a paper placemat depicting a map of Eurasia, with the restaurant’s country of inspiration highlighted, just in case anyone doesn’t know precisely where Uzbekistan is.', 'Nargis Park Slope, like its flagship, does not traffic in upscalification. Nothing is a miniaturized, nasturtium-topped riff on something humble and hearty from back home. Bangiyev does not sell overpriced kebabs with wagyu beef or foie gras (though if he did, I bet they’d be grand). The closest thing to fusion or local adaptation is the slice of New York cheesecake.', 'Bangiyev serves classics. He slicks his beef tongue and radish salads with mayo. He stuffs samsa, flaky meat pies with juicy, chewy bits of beef, lamb, and onion. He forms non (Uzbek bread) into the shape of an old-timey car wheel, as is the style in Tashkent, baking it in the tandoor to a light golden brown. The middle is flat and pretzel-like, like a hubcap, while the round, almost pneumatic exterior is pure bagel chew.', 'Bamboo baskets of manti — dumplings the size of a xiao long bao — come stuffed with pumpkin, the official gourd of Central Asia. The flesh itself is spiked with a traditional blend of black pepper and raw sugar: just enough sweetness to require a dunking in tart sour cream. ', 'Bangiyev’s charcoal-tinged kebabs rank among the city’s finest. He lets the bamboo smoke permeate, but never overpower, the flesh in question. Skirt steak ($8) bursts with concentrated beefiness. Lamb chuck exhibits a restrained funk, a marked tenderness, and beguiling sweetness. The heat transforms chicken hearts into springy, snappy saltiness, with little sinew or offally tang. And chicken wings stun with their technicality; the gentle cooking renders out all the schmaltzy fats, leaving the skin with a blackened crispness whose texture recalls phyllo and whose complex aromas evoke porcini. ', 'If any of the meats are too fatty, douse them with chile vinegar and cleanse the palate with beer. ', 'Pair the kebabs with plov, the elaborate pilaf that’s essentially the national dish of Uzbekistan. Bangiev cooks it the traditional way, fat-slicked basmati rice heated in a steel kazan over shards of carrots and layers of lamb leg. The flavors are unambiguous: The natural sugars of carrots amplify the funk of game. ', 'At this point, the pain of stomach distension sets in. Quell the hurt with black tea, and order the classic Central Asian wedding dessert, chak-chak.

We’d eat the grilled lamb with vodka tonics or red wine while watching the Yankees on TV. Back then, when too many Americans viewed their fellow citizens with suspicion because of the way they looked or the language they spoke, it would’ve been hard to imagine that there’d soon be too many Uzbek restaurants to count in New York, that places like Nargis would be standing room only, and that a Tashkent-born chef would eventually expand not just to Park Slope but to Williamsburg as well, which is his plan for 2018. What a city.', 'Cost: Salads, soups, and starters: $9-$16; kebabs: $7-$14; mains: $12-$25.', 'Sample dishes: Tongue salad, lagman soup, lamb and beef samsa, chebureki, pumpkin manti, chicken- heart kebab, lamb kebab, ground beef and lamb kebab, chuchvara, chak-chak.']"
68,"['Claire Welle and Samantha Safer’s Clinton Hill restaurant beautifully challenges local diners', 'The realities of foie gras production, which involve force-feeding duck or geese, have prompted chefs to seek more humane alternatives, from self-engorging birds to blending chicken liver with butter. But what if the best way to mimic the taste of this classic luxury is to do away with death altogether? ', 'During a recent meal at Otway, an envelope pusher of a restaurant in Clinton Hill, a server ferried over a dessert plate of yeast semifreddo, a healthy-sounding combination that recalled bean burgers or kale smoothies.', 'The kitchen makes an ice cream base out of cream and butter, blends in fresh yeast and dark, malty Vegemite, freezes the mixture in a disc-shaped mold, lets it partially thaw during dinner service, and tops it off with huckleberry puree and a rye cookie. The color is tan. The texture is denser than gelato. And the flavor is a dead ringer for foie gras. I asked the waiter whether there’s liver in the dessert. She shook her head. I continued eating, slowly, and then furiously.', 'The duo of yeasts imparts the product with a subtle minerality. And the huckleberry, laced with a whisper of verjus, kicks in the requisite sugars and acidity to keep everything balanced. The recipe is simple, almost mundane, but the alchemy that occurs somewhere in between emulsification and defrosting results in a transformation one might more closely associate with a Hogwarts spell than an act of normal gastronomy. ', 'And if that still comes across as too avant-garde, Otway sells regular foie gras too. ', 'The yeast semifreddo, like so much else at Otway, is not the product of a Silicon Valley fake-meat startup. It is not the combined effort of a culinary team with a deep background in avant-garde flavor combinations. The dish is a simple act of experimentation. Claire Welle, who creates the pastries, says she chose yeast as a flavoring agent because she wanted to “explore ingredients used for function and see if they could operate as flavor.”', 'Here it’s worth noting that Welle is essentially the head baker, as well as the executive chef, butcher, fromagere — she makes her own Hungarian liptauer — dishwasher, and occasional server. When I ask her about all these duties she says everyone in the kitchen shares responsibilities. She refers to herself as a “dirty line cook.” Her business partner, Samantha Safer, balances the books and bartends most nights. ', 'Safer steers me toward the snails on a recent evening. They are deshelled, skewered, grilled, and served in a verdant pool of parsley coulis. The snails boast the texture of delicate clams; the coulis tames the saltiness. The dish also includes under-roasted sunchokes, which you can eat around.', 'Otway opened one year ago, born from the ashes of Tilda All Day, a venue that Safer and Welle ran with a third partner before a sticky breakup.', 'The single room of a restaurant, at first glance, looks like any painfully chic American bistro. Imagine: soft lighting, brown wooden chairs, white walls, pressed-tin ceilings, an amaro cart, giant windows for performative brunching, cute little shelves sparsely packed with ornamental birds and plants.

There’s the wallpaper, with all of its green, perpendicular zigzagging; the diagonal parquet paneling; the bartop that cuts back and forth like a hallway from Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice; and the partially tiled floor, unfinished like a game of minesweeper. ', 'The physical space is an ode to elegant, and somewhat unexpected, angles, a rubric that jibes with Otway’s small plates, which subvert in powerful and surprising ways. ', 'Fried chickpeas crack and crumble. Then they jolt the palate, first with a wallop of vinegar, then with the sweet musk of dry-aged beef fat, which coats them like a doughnut glaze. Kohlrabi, sliced thin and rolled up like rigatoni, is pleasantly tart. Pierce your fork further down. Hidden underneath is a puree of cured Bayonne pork and mayo, a modern riff on a 1970s ham salad. ', 'Carpaccio, the paper-thin salad of the meat world, looks like any other. Now take a bite of the raw venison. The crimson flesh acts as a sublime delivery mechanism for subdued flavor of pine; Welle tells me she makes the oil from a juniper bush one of her cooks found in Sunset Park.', 'These bits of delicious whimsy make Otway, along with Olmsted and the dearly departed Gwynnett Street (where Welle worked), an important fixture in one of the city’s more sparsely populated restaurant categories: the experimental neighborhood spot. These are venues that don’t just push back against the safer gastronomy mainstream. They also promote, by virtue of their crowds, the notion that residential areas are teeming with diners who crave culinary creativity.', 'Helping this matter is the fact that every small plate at Otway is under $20. Even half a dozen oysters, easily $24 in some Manhattan venues, are just $12 here. And incidentally, there is nothing hifalutin or tricky about them. They’re just briny, perfectly shucked bivalves. ', 'The first course at Otway is always bread, and it’s always free, a necessity that can smooth over the fact that it sometimes takes 10 minutes to get drinks and a cool half hour for snacks to arrive. The current offering is a naturally leavened miche loaf with a soft, sour, almost custardy crumb and a sturdy crust whose flavors recall burnt chocolate. ', 'Otway also puts out a fluffy, butter-drenched rye to pair with the venison carpaccio and a denser, nuttier rye to balance out acidity of boquerones and fat of butter in her anchovy toast. Of course, one shouldn’t overlook the toasted miche that comes with the silky foie gras torchon; the chefs slick it with enough rendered duck fat to impart it with the unmistakable tang of dry-aged game. And since we’re being comprehensive, Welle, during brunch, also serves brioche with chocolate, dill biscuits, financiers, squash miso quick bread, coffee cakes, sticky maple buns, and an olive loaf. ', 'Welle says she doesn’t consider herself a proper baker. I disagree. And while Otway’s selection isn’t quite as wide or technical as, say, High Street on Hudson, it ranks as one of the more satisfying new bread programs in the city. ', 'Does the crepe count too? For most of last year Otway rolled it up and topped it with uni, a dish that’s been discontinued due to quality issues with the urchin. The current preparation involves folding the small crepe into the shape of a taco and stuffing it with a generous supply of cold, salty crab and bevy of herbs, from parsley to fennel. It is an improvement on 99 percent of the lobster rolls hawked in this town, and it costs just $13. ', 'Otway uses its mains to counterbalance some of the edgier tendencies of the starters. There are just four entrees. I vouch for two of them; skip the run-of-the-mill hanger steak and the vegetable pot au feu, whose thin onion broth and competently cooked potatoes make it feel more like a side dish than a compelling composition in its own right.', 'Welle’s best meat course is a pitch-perfect duck breast, with cleanly rendered fat, crispy skin, and a clever wallop of clove to counteract the gentle gaminess of the bird. Stewed cranberries add tartness and color. Just as impressive is the dorade, its skin as crisped as a chicharon, with the flesh of the fish lying in a sweet, concentrated lobster sauce. ', 'If the kitchen is offering its coconut pot de creme as a special, order it; a layer of passionfruit curd tames the sweet custard. Otherwise, the right move is the aforementioned yeast semifreddo. It’s a shame that restaurants like Otway only seem to come along once every few years or so; homegrown venues providing affordable, accessible inspiration will do a heck of a lot more to bring more folks into the dining world than, say, yet another fast-casual chain.', 'Cost: Starters at $3-$18; mains at $23-$28; desserts at $9-$12', 'Sample dishes: Anchovy toast, kohlrabi with Bayonne ham and chervil, crab crepe with herbs, raw salsify with pine and huckleberries, dorade with sauce American, yeast semifreddo with huckleberry and rye.', 'Bonus tip: Advance bookings available via Resy; the bar is open to walk-ins but fills up quickly.']"

It was beachy and pretty, but too Hawaiian Punchy-sweet for my taste. I could barely drink the whole glass, but I appreciated the idea of it.

Can’t San Francisco, even the new San Francisco, appreciate a place without a kale-beet salad or $13 cocktails?

', 'It took just two weeks for Patterson’s Alta to become Kaya, and it kind of feels that way — as if he decided to throw together a Jamaican-themed-party for the Uber-Twitter set — with framed black-and-white prints of kids playing cricket, pineapple straws sticking out of colorful cocktails, and a projector playing Jimmy Cliff’s 1972 film The Harder They Come. ', 'They are all very cool touches — along with bright turquoise paint and an abundance of leafy-green plants — but still something at Kaya felt… off.  Maybe it was that reggae doesn’t really go with blazer-clad tourists grabbing a bite pre-show or with guys in tucked-in button-downs glued to their iPhones. ', 'Maybe it was that I overheard one customer look at a photo of Usain Bolt on the wall and ask: “Is that the owner?” ', 'Maybe it was that for a restaurant hoping to create black community, the customers were — apart from a smattering of African-American families and a lone dude in a knit cap and dreads at the bar — pretty much San Francisco’s sea of monochromic white.  ', ""It's not Kaya’s fault, of course, it’s this damn city’s, where the African-American population is dwindling by the day and black culture is too. "", 'Perhaps, if Kaya keeps cooking, it can help change that. Still, a restaurant alone cannot alter the demographics or trajectory of an entire city. Nor can a menu that caters to it.', 'The crispy salmon skin with Brussels sprouts was the best “big eat” of the bunch — fleshy and flavorful, if a tad salty — yet there was nothing especially Jamaican about it; just another well-cooked, sustainable, $29 salmon in San Francisco.

I’m not afraid of getting messy, especially for a meal, but this just wasn’t worth the effort.', 'Salt fish fritters', 'I actually gave up, and turned my attention to the black-pepper tofu, a “small eat,” which was doused in a similar sticky — yet delicious — sauce. The tofu, caramelized in soy and ginger, was a much better vehicle for it. The caramelized carrots, tender chunks in a pomegranate molasses sauce speckled with toasted pine nuts, was another star of the small eats. The salt fish fritters, set over a bed of collard greens, looked like arancini of the sea: a trio of panko-crusted balls with a deep-fried exterior so thick it overpowered the fishiness and subtle kick of the whipped habanero-spiked salted cod and potato inside.', 'The piri piri chicken had no kick whatsoever, despite its chile pepper-smoked paprika marinade. A few splashes from the bottle of Scotch Bonnet on the table helped. It tasted like roast chicken, suitable and succulent, but in a city suddenly teeming with chickens, it didn’t stand out from the flock.', 'The jerk chicken, however, did (though there’s not much competition in these parts). Mary’s organic breast, drumsticks, and wings, rubbed, 48-hours marinated, smoked, and blackened, was satisfyingly spicy. Juicy one night, too dry the next. Nonetheless, it was jerk chicken to enjoy. Though I’d probably enjoy it more at Kingston 11, where it’s $19 — not $24.', 'Our server only gave us the lengthy list of rums after we’d drank enough — and out of curiosity asked for it: “Wait, isn’t this supposed to be a ‘rum bar’? Why is all the rum buried in cocktails?” Note to Kaya: Put those 4-ounce tasting flights front and center on the menu and we probably would’ve started with one. (Not the $213 one. Though, according to our server, it is a popular order.) ', 'That’s the thing: At these prices, in these digs, in this town, it\'s tough to pull off a place like Kaya. In an earlier interview with Eater, Jones said he wants ""people to leave Market Street and get into a Caribbean state of mind."" I mean, flaming bananas and pineapple-stamped straws, boozy black cake and Bob Marley tunes, help create somewhat of an island vibe. The food has a transportive moment or two, too.

Which is exactly how a neighborhood restaurant is supposed to feel, even if it’s not your neighborhood restaurant.', 'My friends had yet to arrive, and so I took the opportunity to do what one does after slogging across town at rush hour, to a quiet corner between Potrero Hill and the Mission, home to the Muni depot, KQED, and not much else.', '“Mind if I use the restroom?” I asked the host, perhaps miswording my question when what I really meant was: Where’s the bathroom?', '“Uh, go ahead,” he said, in what I, as a native East Coaster, considered a welcoming tone. “I’d rather you do it now, rather than at the table.” For a second, it was as if I’d left smiley San Francisco for blunt Boston. I felt at ease.', 'I actually remembered where the bathroom was. I’d been there before it was The Morris, back when it was the Slow Club, as it was for almost a quarter century.

Same black-and-white “ESPRESSO” sign on the cement exterior, which reminded me of the faded roadside motels that still tout “Free Color TV.” Same garage-like glass windows; same narrow bar area tucked in the back, except now tall electric-green fronds separate it. Same chairs, same square tables (with new tops) arranged in the same format around the same boxy but convivial 40-seat room.', 'The only thing that has really changed is the food.

So I wondered why, a year later,  the restaurant always seemed to have ample availability. At 6:30, 7:15, 7:30, 7:45… "", 'When we showed up one night at 6:30, the crowd was sparse but eventually filled out. On another night, at 9 p.m., the place was packed, including a long table of two dozen tech workers toasting something. But on a Wednesday at lunch, it was so utterly empty when we walked in that we felt awkward admitting we actually had a reservation.', 'I loved the Slow Club’s low-key-cool vibe and Prather Ranch burger as much as everyone else, but I didn’t mourn its departure for long. There are plenty of places to get a delicious cheeseburger these days. Though, unfortunately, The Morris isn’t one of them. (Served only on the brief lunch menu, it was too dense, with barely melted comte. Its thick, crisped, “fries” — which were, in fact, entire fingerling potatoes— on the other hand, trumped most.)', 'But The Morris isn’t about something as banal as a $17 burger anyway. It’s about a $104 duck. (Only $52 for a half!) It’s about duck mousse and duck rillettes and duck offal confit, all of which were divine. It’s also about pork trotters: fried, smoky, stupendous. ', 'Otherwise, as a table, we unfortunately picked a wrong dish or two. Even kimchi and pepitas couldn’t save a lackluster heirloom melon salad. The mixed melon balls reminded me of the fruit platters my mom used to assemble with her trusty plastic melon baller, a 1980s suburban staple. The lingcod was a letdown, too — the tomato-shrimp broth too mild, the fish too mushy.', 'The irrefutably right dish, however, was the dumpling. An indulgent, $3.50, two-bite translucent orb stuffed with braised chicken, Sonoma foie gras, and roasted maitake mushrooms, and topped with a wisp of bonito that bended in the non-breeze, like one of those prescient red cellophane fish that old noodle chain off Fillmore used to present with the bill.

When I got a good hunk, I got an intensely smoky, rich, tender bite enhanced by a luscious, caramelized duck-honey-espresso jus. But I also had trouble getting to it at all. Neither my teeth nor my weapon could cut entire sections, as the skin proved too thick. For a hundred bucks, I thought it should be flawless, the duck of dreams.

Slow cooked onions are a study in slouchiness, an ode to the texture of mush. Yes, two of the most prominent and indulgent riffs come from two of the world’s late, great food writers — Marcella Hazan, who recommends cooking the onions in lard, and James Beard, whose butter-laden recipe Food52 considers the “highest form of caramelized onions known to man.” And yet the dish is almost entirely absent New York’s Italian restaurants — almost.', 'I Sodi, a decade-old Tuscan restaurant in the West Village, corrects this allium oversight with a bit of elegant austerity.', 'The kitchen uses just three ingredients: red onions, salt, and a little bit of olive oil, cooking them down and tossing the sauce with house-made tagliatelle and parmesan. Anyone who finds the flavor of slow cooked onions to be a sugar substitute, take note: There is no lusciousness in I Sodi’s version, no taste of fat. Like a dry Amontillado sherry, the caramel color belies a lean, sharp flavor. The little gobs exude an earthiness so profound they recall the meatiness of a vegetarian chili. ', 'Braised onions might not be the central reason this tiny spot commands a two hour wait on Fridays. But their grandeur certainly suggest what chef Rita Sodi can do with very little.', 'Sodi, a fashion industry vet who was raised on a farm north of Florence, opened her namesake restaurant in 2008. She had no formal training as a chef. I thought her best dish, in the earliest days, was the negroni.', 'The venue quickly cultivated a loyal neighborhood following, and I heard the food improved over the years, though Sodi didn’t receive a serious level of critical attention until 2014, when she opened the excellent Via Carota nearby, a larger, more boisterous, pan-regional, Italian spot with chef Jody Williams.', 'The two chefs have morphed into bona fide (but small time) empire builders; they’ll soon open Pisellino, a small cafe that will sell cute little tramezzini. But before the media coverage over that spot starts to build, it’s worth throwing the following into the mix: I Sodi, quieter and more compact than Via Carota, has transformed itself into one of the city’s finest Italian spots, a love letter to Tuscany whose pure product obsessions can make it feel as focused as some of the wildly expensive sushi spots popping up around town. ', 'The room, in January, smells heavily of the black truffles that are native to Sodi’s homeland. She lets them rain over pappardelle for $39 (compared with $65 at Babbo). And she shaves them over grilled sourdough slicked with honey and draped in lard, the sweet fat just warm enough to release the mossy overtones of the fungi. A cynic would dismiss this as found food, as an easily assembled luxury; I’d respectfully counter that Sodi’s brilliance is taking this trinity of powerful Tuscan flavors — charcuterie, bread, and truffles — and forging a precarious balance among them through the primitive power of fire.', 'Sodi, who’s sometimes overly humble about the power of her own cooking, would likely scoff at that description. “It’s just food. It’s just enjoyable food,” she told The New York Times in 2014. “That’s it. You put it on the table, you talk and you eat.” ', 'There is, at first glance, a certain incongruity about the cooking of Tuscany, an expression of bountiful produce and game meats. There’s something paradoxical about how the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, how the home of poets like Dante and polymaths like Da Vinci, how the land of the breathtakingly complex Brunello di Montalcino, a wine that can age for half a century or more, is also where the cooking somewhat fastidiously leans toward the simple and straightforward. But it doesn’t take long to realize that the cooking is far from simplistic. ', '“Tuscan food tastes like itself,” writes the famed memoirist Frances Mayes. “Ingredients are left to shine, not combined with a list as long as your arm or tortured into odd combinations.”', 'I mention this because in an era when phrases like “rustic” and “comfort” in New York restaurants can feel like a code for safe and boring, and in an era where Italian fare of any variety can feel more like a “sure thing” business decision than a culinary one, it would be easy to look at I Sodi’s menu and write it off as plain or pandering. Look, another appetizer of grilled vegetables. ', 'Well, try those vegetables, especially if they’re porcinis. Sodi gently burnishes the fungi, leaving the caps soft and squishy, while the stalks remain firmer. Some bites burst with a straightforward nuttiness. Others begin a touch watery, then echo faintly of wood and pine. I thought about these complexities over I Sodi’s giant plate of porcini, for which I paid $23. And then I thought about a one-note version I sampled at a Japanese spot where dinner ran $500 for two. ', 'Sodi fries her artichoke hearts without batter; she serves them with neither aioli for dipping nor lemon for squeezing. A waiter simply places a white bowl of salted hearts on the bartop, and you eat them as if they were unevenly cut potato chips, crispy and copper-colored at the edges, plump and soft near the fatter side.', 'The restaurant’s recipe for steak tartare doesn’t contain cheddar or sunchokes like the more experimental versions at Wildair or Estela. And yet the flavor is as revelatory as any of its modern analogues; the cool meat, hand chopped just larger than risotto grains, shimmers in its dressing of anchovy oil. Raw onions lend a whisper of sweetness at first, and then a delicate irony funk lingers — until a forkful of arugula washes the palate clean. If there’s a better traditional tartare in the city, I don’t know of it.', 'I Sodi is small. It’s a single room of a restaurant, accessible just behind a barn house-style sliding wood door; the only thing that doesn’t feel genuinely Italian is a Dyson space heater in the foyer. There are three tables up front, five along the wall, a sixteen seat marble bar opposite them, and and airplane-style aisle in between; a beverage cart passing through would surely elicit bumps and bruises. And yet somehow the entire space has always felt comfortable. Perhaps it’s the leather-softened bar stools. Perhaps it’s the sound-absorbing tablecloths. Perhaps it’s even that sliding doors, which is so silent that new patrons don’t seem to physically enter as conjure themselves.', 'The closest thing to an art installation is the rack of amari and digestivi that stretches half the length of the bar. You might need one or two during the meal — a shot of rose-scented Montenegro, a dose of rhubarb-laced Sibona — as pastas are portioned like mains while the actual mains can easily feed two. That’s not a bad deal considering that virtually every pasta, save truffles or the lasagna, tops out at $21. ', 'That caramelized onion masterpiece is the right move for a shared mid-course. So is cacio e pepe, a preparation whose ubiquity seems to be approaching hamburger levels in pasta-focused restaurants. I Sodi’s stands out from the crowd by using a snappy dried spaghetti over the softer tonnarelli used elsewhere — and by using a strong dose of pepper, letting the sting of the capscium act as a proper counterweight to the rich pecorino. ', 'Tortellini en brodo is also brilliant, packing a bite so al dente it almost feels closer to crudite than macaroni; the mortadella and ricotta dumplings sit in a capon broth that’s pure sodium-umami bliss.', 'Skip the sinewy, pancetta-wrapped rabbit. A better call is the giant, obscenely juicy cornish hen roast under a brick, or the slowly-braised wagyu brisket, a soft mound of concentrated beefiness over a smear of buckwheat polenta. Sodi cooks the grains in nothing but water — there’s no butter or cream — ensuring that the starch, normally a digestive evening ender, acts a light and nimble foil to the beef.', 'Whatever fat the polenta and caramelized onions lack, the desserts make up for, from the fior di latte gelato drenched in walnut liqueur (a kind of boozy affogato), to the graham cracker-studded chocolate ganache “salami” (imagine a more elegant cookie dough), to the tiramisu so dense with mascarpone it could qualify as a cheese course for two. All the more reason for another shot of Montenegro. Or Ramazzotti. Or Branca Menta. It’s all enough to make you realize that Sodi, along with Williams, have essentially, and perhaps unexpectedly, risen to the top of New York’s downtown Italian scene.', 'Cost: $13-$22 for starters; pastas $18-$21 (lasagna is $27); mains, which can easily be shared, run $16-$41.', 'Sample dishes: Steak tartare with arugula, grilled porcinis, fried artichokes, cacio e pepe, caramelized onion tagliatelle, tortellini en brodo, Cornish hen grilled under a brick, chocolate salami with graham crackers, affogato with walnut liquor.

NetJets private aircraft have their exclusive Cajun snack mix. Every luxe empire has a signature amenity, something patrons enjoy for a few seconds and then forget about. At L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, one of the world’s most expensive restaurant chains, that amenity is mashed potatoes. Guests at the new Manhattan outpost receive a small, rich pot of pommes puree during the final savory course. Fan-like indentations decorate the top layer, a deft act of latte art for potatoes.', 'The freebie seems generous in an age when a side of steakhouse potatoes can command a steep price, but keep in mind the cheapest steak here is a 6-ounce American cut that costs $95, service included.', 'Waiters announce two things upon presenting the pommes. First, they identify the product as “Joël Robuchon’s” potatoes, in case anyone suspects that the “chef of the century” outsourced the recipe for a mere side dish. Second, they claim that the potatoes themselves are “famous.” This is true. In 1980s Paris, the indulgent spuds helped Robuchon make a name for himself at his now-closed Jamin. The impossible ratio of butter to fingerlings, as well the fact that Robuchon was serving such a humble dish at an ambitious venue, epitomized the chef’s efforts to counter France’s lighter, brighter, yet somewhat affected nouvelle cuisine. ', 'The dish does not live up to its legendary status, at least not here in New York. Vigorous whisking imparts the potatoes with the texture of silk, but the dairy fats, which cool quickly, stiffen up to the density of a leaden paste. The potatoes do not taste of the earthy starch any more than they taste of good butter. They almost taste of nothing. And so through the power of manipulation, such an integral part of fine dining, Robuchon’s cooks have taken two of the world’s great ingredients and turned them into haute Crisco.', 'Once upon a time, before the Robuchon Incorporated assembly line manufactured foie gras-stuffed quail at a dozen spin-offs across the world, L’Atelier was a relevant New York restaurant.', 'The original Manhattan location opened in 2006, a few years after Robuchon shook some of the stodginess out of Parisian fine dining with Japanese-style counter service and Spanish-style small plates. The Big Apple L’Atelier was a key player in our city’s own culinary tie loosening; the chef’s tapas-focused menu ensured well-heeled walk-ins could dispense with large sums of cash on visually stunning small plates almost as quickly as on a pair of Manolos. It closed in 2012. ', 'Nearly half a decade later, L’Atelier is back, this time in a cool corner of West Chelsea. It is not a relevant New York restaurant. As countless small plates places put out ambitious fare that’s not just creative but rationally priced as well, L’Atelier has devolved into a mediocre bacchanalia for the rich.', 'It feels like 2006 all over again. The Champagne-by-the-glass list is Veuve Clicquot-only. The color scheme is classic L’Atelier: jet-black stools contrasted against crimson leather cushions and a shiny rosewood counter. The room is decorated with green apples in glass bowls, chile peppers in jars, and dried spaghetti in black vases, a design ethos that recalls the Getty Images stock food photography archive. The soundtrack is international hotel lobby bossa nova.', 'The menu highlights dishes that could’ve been copied or adapted from Robuchon outposts in Taipei, Singapore, London, or quite frankly anywhere. A handful of black truffle shavings are paired with a salad of cold artichokes and foie gras ($75); the muted, obvious flavors feel ripped from the first-class cabin menu of a 1985 transatlantic flight to London. Wagyu beef, in turn, is subjected to the clubstaurant slider treatment of the aughts, two tiny, underseasoned, overcooked burgers (topped with foie gras) for $44.', 'The kitchen slathers steak tartare with so much mustard and Worcestershire that it imparts the tartare with the mouthfeel of a chunky pudding, drowning out the fattiness and flavors of the meat itself. This appetizer is nearly double the price of better versions at Estela or Wildair.', 'Questions of relevance aside, what’s frightening is how representative L’Atelier actually is of contemporary New York. It symbolizes a city overrun by an affluent corporate monoculture, from boutique spin classes that charge thousands for yearly memberships to fast-casual salad chains that don’t take cash to sushi chains where a $200 starting price almost seems like a break. ', 'L’Atelier, whose prices feel rooted in an effort to exclude, attracts a wealthy class of New Yorkers willing to pay stupid sums of money for brand-name luxuries. On any given night the 34-seat counter appears just as crowded as the one at Ssäm Bar. Patrons occasionally show up in red carpet-style blowouts, perfectly tailored suits, and backless dresses. “This goes great on granola and yogurt in the morning,” a Russian speaker next to me says of the 1983 Chateau D’Yquem she’s drinking, a heck of a breakfast condiment at $1,150 by the bottle. Her companion orders a shot of Macallan M whisky, which runs $750. I’m sure it was great.', 'L’Atelier’s menu isn’t so much an exercise in creativity as it is an exhausting effort in repackaging the same preparations over and over, in different sizes, in different menu formats, and at different prices. The $325 tasting, which this critic did not order, is mostly a listicle-like aggregation of dishes from the a la carte offerings.', 'Here’s a bit of advice: Order the beet and apple tartare, tangy cubes of the fruit topped with a pungent green mustard ice cream. Or try the aubergine, confit cylinders of eggplant, as soft as gelatin, over dots of light, bright vegetable curry. Just as remarkable is the bass, steamed to a perfect flakiness and scented with a light foam of lemongrass. Le Bernardin would be lucky to serve such a masterpiece. ', 'And virtually any bread by boulangere Tetsuya Yamaguchi is stunning, from the Comté-pocked bread boats (like mini Georgian khachapuri) to the simple, flaky escargot rolls.', 'Meanwhile, skip the sweetbreads. The kitchen served them with the sinewy connective tissue still attached, making them difficult to cut even with a steak knife. The thymus glands were undercooked to such a degree that they jiggled like Jell-O. Some bites packed a bilious tang that recalled beef cartilage that had turned.', 'A little bowl of chestnut soup with little knobs of foie gras is fine, but surely suffers from the city’s most expensive soup per slurp ratio at $42. A snack-sized portion of saffron risotto, with little saffron flavor or any type of compelling fat to soften the grit of the undercooked rice, runs $38. A green curry sauce is brilliantly aromatic; the three scallops that sit in it recall the flavor of styrofoam.', 'There is an acceptable duck main at $36 — if acceptable to you means a single slice of canard with less profound aging, delicate fats, or crispy skin as at The Pool or, quite frankly, most any other competent restaurant in the city.', 'Pastry chef Salvatore Martone fills a fist-sized sugar sphere with buttermilk chantilly, lemon sorbet, and Thai basil gelee; it’s approximately 45 seconds’ worth of electric acidity and citrus aromatics for $28. At this level of quality I’d (begrudgingly) pay that price again.', 'It’s tempting to recommend L’Atelier as a dessert-only venue, because virtually all of the sweets are fantastic — just keep in mind that a humble tasting of three will pump up your bill by nearly $100. The only skippable dessert is the “chocolate sensation” — an Oreo crumble-coated scoop of white chocolate cream, with a touch of mousse, that constitutes the most expensive riff on cookies and cream in the universe ($28). ', 'That dish, like others, is available at L’Ateliers across the globe. The fact that Robuchon has remained the world’s most Michelin-starred chef for the better part of a decade by essentially opening up the same restaurants over and over again is more critical of the French culinary guide than it is of him. ', 'And the fact that humans flock to this duty-free lounge in Chelsea — and order clubby wagyu sliders at such a clip one expects a model-DJ to drop the bass halfway through dinner — says more about the mall-ification of New York, and the demand for luxuries as obvious as a Gucci clutch, than the predictable output of a chain restaurant.', 'Cost: Small plates, $28 (eggplant confit)-$95 (American wagyu ribcap); main courses at $52 (beef tartare)-$135 (filet mignon); desserts at $28. Set menus are more, obviously. All prices are service-included. Expect to spend about $200-$300 per person on a la carte meals.', 'Sample dishes: Eggplant confit, Maine lobster with black pepper, beet and apple tartare with green mustard, beef and foie gras burgers, scallops with green curry, sugar sphere with lemon sorbet and Thai basil gelee, white chocolate ice cream with Oreo cookie crumble.', 'Bonus tip: The same building hosts a more approachable Joël Robuchon restaurant called Le Grill de Joël Robuchon\xa0, or “The Grill,” which sells a $24 cheeseburger, $58 Iberico ham, $95 Maine lobster, and desserts that command the same price as at L’Atelier.']"
73,"['My early associations with the Alembic, when it opened a dozen years ago, was that it was a moody, dark place for cocktails, really good cocktails, craft cocktails, which had yet to sweep the city. The food was there to keep the cocktails company, but not something to seek out on its own. Which is why when I heard that in her first year as Alembic’s chef, Rachel Aronow was nominated for a James Beard Rising Star award, I was intrigued. Excited, even. The best thing I’d ever eaten on Haight Street was a Ben & Jerry’s waffle cone. ', 'And now, despite a menu with more downs than ups, the best thing I’ve eaten on Haight Street is Alembic’s fall squash veloute. It’s a fancy word for a thick, velvety sauce, in this case, butternut blended with spices and vegetable stock poured over foamy dollops of Stilton blue cheese and a scattering of squash seeds and cayenne-spiked sunflower seeds that gave each soothing spoonful a surprising crunch. It was a soup fit for birds — and I liked it.', 'I also liked the Brussels sprouts, whole young bulbs from Half Moon Bay in a maple-aji Amarillo glaze roasted to an addictive chewy-crisp. A simple ceramic slab of wide, slippery ribbons of pappardelle in a hearty lamb ragu was a welcome addition to the otherwise in-your-face fussy entrees. The scallops were lightly seared and profoundly buttery, but plated with foam and flowers and more embellishment than necessary — as were most dishes at the Alembic. ', 'I get it: If you’ve got a 1,000-square-foot garden behind your urban restaurant filled with everything from Walla Walla onions to purple pineapple sage blossoms, you want to flaunt it. Still, I wanted to tell Sade crooning “Smooth Operator” overhead the same thing I wanted to tell the chef: Tone it down a tad.', 'Had I only consumed the above — plus the jerk-spiced duck hearts and the star of Aronow’s house-made charcuterie board: smoky, thinly-sliced duck prosciutto — I would’ve ordered another Choose Your Knees cocktail (I chose gin, one of at least 40, mixed with orange blossom honey, lavender, and pressed lemon juice, served up) and called it a perfectly fine night. But, of course, I kept eating. ', 'Over three visits, I tried everything on the a la carte menu, including the rabbit. I’m fairly certain we were the only people in the place, let alone on Haight Street, eating rabbit. Then again, it’s Haight Street; you never know. ', 'Eating was actually a strong word. It was more like picking at. Pushing the tea-smoked roulade around the plate like apathetic teenagers, hoping if, perhaps, we found the right bite, it would taste better. Unfortunately, we didn’t. The rabbit meat was fleshy, almost translucent pink, to the point that we repeatedly wondered aloud if it was cooked. Oozing with an unrecognizable mixture of pork belly and foie gras, it was a barely edible bundle, and a most unattractive one — encased in a drab gray pistachio dukkah-rubbed crust that, even for this ardent carnivore, too closely resembled the color of rabbit fur. It didn’t help that the accompanying supposedly roasted sunchokes were as hard as a potato just dug from the field. ', 'I ordered the entree again on my next visit — and again I shouldn’t have. ', 'I tried most things twice. And the second verse was the same as the first. Take the red kuri squash “Tetris” tots. A title that comes with certain expectations: that they be bite-size, yes, but also golden and hot and crisp. The rosy-orangey hue would’ve worked too, had this starter not been the antithesis of all things tot: that is, lukewarm and mushy, and pushed against a mound of pistachio aioli that didn’t add much. “Pigs in a Blanket” is another beloved app that arrived bastardized. A more apt name would have been Hog in a Log — it was a foot-long, panko-fried fatty, stuffed with slow-braised tail, topped with a frizzy toupee of sprouts that didn’t have enough flavor to warrant eating more than a bite or two. Even our party of five left half of the heft on the plate. The Spanish octopus was a tightly wound rubbery mound of tentacles; tucked with pretty romanesco and pink petals and surrounded by verde gel polka dots, it looked like an octopus dolled up for prom. ', 'It’s obvious that Aronow gives the same care and attention to her food that is given to the stellar cocktails, and I hope her Brussels sprouts and fancy soup and charcuterie are a sign of what’s to come. But ultimately I left feeling the same about Alembic as I always have: It’s a great spot for sitting and drinking and snacking — in cozy, wooden, candlelit nooks with the best button-tufted, black leather booths in SF.  ', 'But, for now, if you’re looking for an award-winning meal, you might want to go elsewhere.', 'What it costs: A couple of starters, a couple of entrees, a couple of cocktails, call it $120 for two, before tax and tip. A four-course prix fixe is $56 per person, but then there’s the booze. ', 'What to drink: Between the Canon and the New School, you can’t go wrong, but you do have to be patient. On one night, the duck hearts arrived 10 minutes before our La Didas did. (I liked the Tapatio blanco tequila with ginger, sesame agave, and soda better than a traditional margarita); the Southern Exposure (St. George Terroir gin, lime, mint, celery) went down as easy as the Choose Your Knees. \xa0', 'What to eat: Duck hearts, fall squash veloute, charcuterie, Brussels sprouts, scallops.', 'Bonus tip: The Alembic has not only its own garden but, soon, its own livestock.', '']"

Are you working these days?” ', 'Order: I decided to stray from my regular morning ritual and kick things off as one is supposed to at As Quoted: with an organic turmeric latte, infused with fresh ginger, almond milk, coconut oil, sea salt, and coconut sugar. But then I asked the perky woman behind the counter, “That includes espresso, though, too, right?” She smiled. No. And so I reverted back to my latte, made with Andytown beans and real milk. (The only cow milk item on the menu.) ', 'Adequately caffeinated and settling into the As Quoted spirit, I decided to give the turmeric latte a try. And it was a pleasant surprise. As I sipped the steaming, spicy, coconut creamy, curry-yellow concoction, I felt my skin glow, noticed my stress dissipate, and instantly anti-inflamed. Kidding. Still, Gwyneth, who’s popularized the benefits of the almighty turmeric latte, might be onto something. (As Ayurvedic practitioners, who have been using turmeric for centuries, were before her.)

The brief list of options sounded perfect for my health-focused mission: an open-faced organic almond butter-banana-honey-cinnamon sandwich; avocado toast, of course; and poached eggs over frisee drizzled with a shallot-Champagne vinaigrette (hold the pasture-raised bacon). Except, wait a minute. “Do I have to get it on gluten-free bread?” I asked, fully expecting a gluten-free cafe to offer real bread for those who want it.

Regardless, it was a deeply rich Marin Sun Farms bone broth with cayenne, cumin, broccoli, and an organic mirepoix. It was soothing and satisfying and I felt invigorated just sipping it (if also a little like a white-collar inmate who’d convinced Martha Stewart to cook for her; the $6 portion was small, and served on a spare white tray with a half-slice of multigrain gluten-free bread).

More and more people are anti-gluten and -dairy, -nuts, and -soy, and sisters Kara and Andie Yamagami opened this cafe, in 2016, for them.

75,"['They didn’t have Caffeine-Free Diet Coke (nor should they), and my 70-year-old mother, out from the East Coast, was annoyed.

Forever, my main drag had been all about pizza and Popeye’s and smoked ribs, and then Nopa arrived with elderflower cocktails, little gems, Moroccan vegetable tagine, and transformed it. And despite welcome, if controversial, more recent additions, like $5 toast and $145 omakase — with Greek yogurt, carnitas, and almighty Bi-Rite in between — this stretch of Western Addition still lacked any type of noteworthy, steamy, everyday Asian food. No Chinese. No Vietnamese. No Burmese. Just a sub-standard Thai spot next to the dry cleaners that’s always empty. ', 'But then, holy bulgogi, the Lee brothers were opening a counter-casual spinoff of Namu Gaji, one of my favorite San Francisco restaurants, close to home. I was so excited that I brought my mother, the rare Jew who refuses to eat anything but Italian.', 'And now here we were at Namu Stonepot, a Cal-Asian fusion confusion — not Korean, as the Lee brothers will emphatically tell you — and, sadly, the chicken “tacos” were bringing both of us down.', 'The double-ply sheets of seaweed, in lieu of tortillas, were wilted, weak beneath an unwieldy mound of uniformly diced meat. The whole shebang was bizarrely bland for being marinated in tamari and doused with kimchi salsa and remoulade and teriyaki.

', 'Clearly there are far worse offenses in this world. Still, when it comes to taco offenses, eating one shouldn’t take so much effort. Maybe they should consider renaming it “chicken on top of seaweed” and our expectations would adjust accordingly?', 'But the mochiko fried chicken brought us back from the brink. We got it “Crispy Crack” style, an apt name, as the organic, bite-size tenders were so crisp and succulent and addictive, even my mother ate them. And liked them. Especially when dipped in the sweet, mildly spicy “KFC” sauce, which we ordered on the side.', 'It’s a better strategy than actually ordering it KFC-style (as in Korean-fried, of course, not Kentucky), as the thighs came soaked in the stuff. Each bite was a soggy, gooey, oddly airy mess of sauce and skin that suctioned to my teeth like fluoride at the dentist.', 'I went, in total, four times, partly because I was dying to try the special Marin Sun Farms burger, which turned out to be a thin, barely there patty between two slabs of nori with kimchi, greens, and so much rice they would’ve been better off calling it a burrito.

Oh, it was all there — the koshihikari rice, the kimchi, the egg, the enoki mushrooms and mung bean sprouts, veggies from Namu’s farm, the sizzling hot pot — yet somehow it tasted like a dumbed-down version of the real thing. I looked around for a bottle of something, anything, to spice it up. I didn’t see any sort of condiment, but they happily supplied a ramekin of house-made chile sauce upon request. It helped.', 'It was as if the Lees pressed “mute” on the remote control of their kitchen. Maybe this is what opening a more affordable offshoot means?

Perhaps something is lost in translation.  ', 'Only the kimchi okonomiyaki — a pizza-sized cabbage pancake with its fluttering bonito, vinegary kimchi, and Kewpie mayo — and the Sizzling Sisig — a garlicky, tongue-scorching jumble of pork, jowl and head, with pickled onions and jalapeno rings — revealed any distinct flavors.

The $15 bone broth with noodles, poached organic chicken breasts, bean sprouts, and slow-cooked egg would make a perfect reentry after a 10-day Master Cleanse.

76,"['Four stars for the Prospect-Lefferts Garden restaurant', 'The distinctive food of Rome is enjoying its moment in the moonlight, as a fit successor to our earlier obsessions with Tuscany and Naples. Like Naples, Rome is a pizza town, but unlike Naples, pizzas occur in a bewildering variety of styles. There are round cracker pizzas that can break apart as you bite into them; and thicker circular pies like those of Naples, but slightly crisper. Some pizzas resemble Sullivan Street Bakery’s pizza bianca, oily and bumpy without sauce, sometimes used to make mortadella sandwiches; others are the bready focaccia squares found in bakeries, strewn with zucchini blossoms, onions, or other single ingredients.', 'But one of the most characteristic styles is the pinsa. Some would say it’s not really a pizza, but an oblong flop of dough rounded at either end like a huarache, perhaps originating in ancient Rome as pizza’s ancestor. The dough is different too, a mixture of grains that cooks up light and airy. To compensate for this lack of weight, the toppings are piled on with a freer hand, including unexpected meats and vegetables. Even in New York, where we’re proud of our wild and crazy pies, the pinsa seems unbound by convention.', 'The stated purpose of Prospect Lefferts Gardens newcomer Camillo — named after Count Camillo Negroni, the inventor of the negroni — is turning out pinsas from owner-chef Michele Baldacci, a Florence native who’s also behind Locanda Vini e Olii in Clinton Hill. As a result of the restaurant’s name, Camillo’s supporting liquor program is heavy on the negronis ($10). While the normal formula of this strong swizzle involves gin and Campari, one the nine available here is contrarily made with mezcal, while another features artichoke liqueur, perhaps causing the count to spin in his grave.', 'The bar dominates the front of the restaurant, and its white marble expanse is the best place to dine. The dining room seats around 50 and is defined by old fashioned hanging lamps, beveled mirrors, and a ceiling that looks like the well-worn deck of a clipper ship. It makes you a bit dizzy staring up at it.', 'The pinsas are spectacular. Five depend on tomato sauce, while three others luxuriate in their white cheesiness. But the difficult choice this represents can be avoided: Divided down the middle, a ninth pinsa, the Romana ($15), mixes both types. On one side is a tomatoey Amatriciana sauce from the town of Amatrice in the Apennine Mountains about two hours outside of Rome, featuring funky hog jowl. The other side is spread with cacio e pepe, the peppery Pecorino sauce, another specialty of the Eternal City.', 'Turning pastas into pinsas is a magical idea, also seen in New York City’s ziti and lasagna pies. Other pinsas at Camillo are equally startling. My favorite is the capricciosa ($19), a wild ride of heaped-up tomatoes, olives, artichokes, mushrooms, and prosciutto cotto (baked ham). It’s like a lush open-face sandwich you might take on a picnic. Another pinsa features the very southern Italian pairing of pork sausage and broccoli rabe, and there’s also a fine vegetarian pie topped with eggplant, two types of summer squash, and oodles of onions.', 'If pinsas alone were the province of the restaurant, it would be a fine thing. But Camillo seeks to be a full-blown Italian restaurant, too, dotting its menu with dishes associated with Rome, as well as other quirky regional cooking from around the country. From the Roman stockyards comes coda alla vaccinara ($15), a dense ragu of boneless oxtail that dukes it out in the bowl with thick, wide, fresh pappardelle. Equally splendid are two lamb-stuffed cannelloni smothered in béchamel like mutant enchiladas.', 'The appetizers have shifted around quite a bit since the restaurant’s opening last September. I was particularly fond of cotechino, a cooked pork sausage that arrived on a bed of lentils, the way it’s done in Bologna. It’s a dish usually served around New Year’s and has since disappeared from the menu, though the team says it will return next December. Meanwhile, the bowl of baby octopi awash in gritty red sauce that I didn’t much like — disappointing if you crave charred tentacles — still lingers. The best current app is anchovies on buttered toast ($8), in which dairy and carbs mellow the salty and stinky fish. Even if you don’t normally order anchovies, you’ll like these.', 'There are always at least three piatti, which should each be shared by at least two diners. The fritto misto ($17) is here interpreted in an all-veggie fashion, and comes hot and greasy on top of a sheet of brown paper. Exercise the chicken option ($3 more) to add an extra highlight to the perfectly fried zucchini, onions, artichokes, and cauliflower. Even better is a big hunk of roast goat in gravy, served on one occasion with cubed potatoes and on another with braised chicory.', 'After eating pinsas, apps, pastas, and the voluminous main courses, maybe you’re not ready for dessert. But the slew of closers at Camillo are the soul of simplicity, including a wedge of olive oil cake speckled with pistachios, or a creamy panna cotta dribbled with strawberry sauce. Just the way they do it in Rome.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one app, one pinsa, and one pasta, two glasses of wine, plus tax but not tip, $70', 'Sample dishes: anchovies on buttered toast, Romana pinsa, lamb cannelloni, pistachio olive oil cake\xa0 ', 'What to drink: For those into cocktails, the negronis are worth checking out, but the best accompaniment to the trademark pinsa is an on-tap Moretti beer or a bottle of Lambrusco.', 'Bonus tip: For the budget conscious, the on-tap wines are a very good deal at $20 for 500 ml (try the prosecco); not showy or complex, they go very nicely with pinsas and pastas.']"
77,"['Four stars for the Greenpoint newcomer', 'If you were a fan of Greenpoint in the days when it was a bucolic Brooklyn backwater — before entire streets became paved with trendsetting boutiques and noisy cocktail bars — Chez Ma Tante (“My Aunt’s House”) may be your serene place. ', 'Located at the corner of Calyer and Franklin near the East River’s Bushwick Inlet, the immediate neighborhood remains tree-shaded and slow moving. Houses with small gardens in front line the streets in neat rows. Pale flagstones cover the façade, while a sidewalk café with red umbrellas extends along the north side of the building.', 'Inside, the tables are small and matched, wooden and well-spaced. A bar provides padded stools; plain white globes hanging from the ceiling furnish illumination. In all its plainness, is this yet another French-Canadian bistro of the type we saw at M. Wells and Fedora a few years ago? Well, partly, and the first time I sat down in August, when the place was already four months old, flagons of maple syrup lined the kitchen. Indeed, Chez Ma Tante is named after a Montreal french fry and hot dog stand. But in other ways, the restaurant is very much a unique place.', 'The restaurant is the work of two Cafe Altro Paradiso alums, Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber, and the menu reflects some of the old Estela zaniness. In its emphasis on organ meat pates and terrines, it’s also reminiscent of Montreal’s Au Pied de Cochon. O’Neal once toiled at M. Wells Dinette in P.S. One, and that experience undoubtedly provided further inspiration. The chicken liver pate ($9) might be at home on any bistro menu in town, artfully smeared across the plate and accompanied by grilled toasts and pickled chiles.', 'Other dishes are on another level, offal-wise, particularly with the pig head terrine. This patchwork comes in helter skelter slices, composed of ragged chunks of sinew, fat, and deeply red swatches of meat. It’s about the richest thing you’ve ever tasted and might remind you of the work of U.K. chef Fergus Henderson. I loved it, even though it came with the same toasts and chiles as the chicken liver pate. (The head cheese is currently off the menu, but the waitress assured me it would return: “The chef just didn’t have access to a pig head this week,” she confided.) ', 'Apps from both the snacks and starters sections of the menu are more prosaic, but each offers its own playful twists on familiar recipes. Bright red with radicchio, Caesar salad ($13) comes in lemon dressing so light that it might have been painted on with a brush. Delicate potato chips surmount steak tartare — useless for scooping, but useful for crunch. But it’s the few drops of fish sauce that make this tartare memorable. ', 'The best appetizer, next to the head cheese, is stracciatella ($15), a molten dairy product in the burrata family that comes sluiced with chile oil, wadded with wilted greens, and further kicked in the pants with anchovies. This spectacular bread dip — intensely creamy and briny — could be your entire meal. While there’s no poutine on the menu, the city’s best steak fries are found here, a sublime shade of sun-kissed brown and served with aioli, very much in the Montreal mode. Less Canadian is an oyster service, each $3 bivalve littered with parsley and accentuated with a splash of sauvignon blanc. Think of it as a small collection of raw-oyster salads.', 'Caesar salad; apple sorbet with Polish vodka; Jake Leiber (r) and Aidan O’Neal (l)', 'While the starters come charging out of the gate like a bull at a bullfight, the entrees, modestly priced at $17 to $25, are a little more laid back. There’s a perfect grilled half chicken, deboned, flattened, and served with the same irresistible aioli as the fries; and a skate wing with olives and tomatoes. Fish also makes an appearance in kedgeree, an Anglo-Indian dish that was rendered in yawn-worthy fashion when I first tasted it, too bland by a kilometer. But when I re-experienced it recently, it was much more aggressively seasoned. Hallelujah!', 'At one point, the menu featured potato pierogi in a tart burst of miniature plum tomatoes — a nice tip of the hat by the restaurant to what was once a predominantly Polish community. One entree so good I ate it twice is a slice of pork shoulder grilled like steak and heaped with a pungent Florentine salsa verde. And while it didn’t seem very Canadian, it hit the spot at a place clearly willing to pull out all the stops in delivering an entirely satisfying and even intriguing meal. ', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two snacks or apps, two entrees, and two drinks, plus tax but not tip, $95.', 'Sample Dishes: pig head terrine with gribiche, stracciatello with wilted greens, pork shoulder with salsa verde, falafel with hummus and harissa ', 'What to Drink: draft beer from Brooklyn, Chicago, and the West Coast; wines foreign and domestic by the glass or bottle; and a handful of classic cocktails including great old fashioneds and daiquiris', 'Bonus Tip: Brunch is offered on the weekends, including a few of the better dishes from dinner, plus giant pancakes with maple syrup and a bangin’ egg-and-sausage sandwich with pickled chiles and cheese.']"
78,"['The walk to Chinatown’s most expensive restaurant isn’t easy. For one, hidden behind a chain-link fence down an otherwise desolate alley, the place is hard to find. But that’s not what I mean. What I mean is: Striding past so many homeless people huddled in doorways on your way to blow a thousand bucks on dinner is, well, hard to justify.', 'True, it’s an encounter we have in this increasingly stratified city every single day — but as I stepped around an old man outstretched in a sleeping bag on Broadway, I felt acutely conflicted about my upcoming evening at Eight Tables.  ', 'I also felt excited (if, in jeans, underdressed). The new, yes, eight-table restaurant was arguably San Francisco’s most anticipated opening of the year. George Chen is the brains behind Union Street’s 1990s trailblazing Betelnut, four restaurants in Shanghai, and in March, ChinaLive, the $20 million Eataly of dim sum downstairs. And now he was opening his “home” — or an opulent stage set of it — to the .5 percent, si fang cai-style. Or “private chateau cuisine,” as Chen puts it, a lavish, 10-course feast that takes entertaining tips from 17th-century China.', 'Sitting on a crushed-velvet settee waiting for my date, looking at framed black-and-white Chen family photos and listening to Miles Davis on a midcentury console record player, it indeed felt like I was in someone’s living room. Though when a fellow diner checked in and stiffly took a seat beside me, it felt more akin to an upscale doctor’s waiting room.', 'After several minutes of awkward silence, the fellow diner spoke: “I’ve never been to a restaurant like this,” he said. ', 'Me neither. Because of the price and pomp, some might consider it the French Laundry with chopsticks; a Qing Dynasty-style Quince; a less-austere Benu. But, really, Eight Tables is unlike any restaurant this side of the Pacific — and exactly what chef Chen intended it to be: dinner at his place. The elegant, tan-hued, multi-room maze was regal but warm, with white embossed wallpaper fashioned from antique wedding dress patterns, cushy leather banquettes, and circular, semi-private tables that were comically large for two. ', 'It also includes a full (and appropriately pedigreed) staff: Anthony Keels, a genius bartender who defected from Saison, along with GM Andrew Fuentes; Tony Kim, a sociable sommelier who came from the Clift; and a mannerly server named Huntly, who genuinely thanked us for asking his name. “People rarely do,” he lamented. Then snapped his fingers. “It’s just, ‘deliver my drinks, serve my food.’” ', 'Which he did, flawlessly. He was aided by a fleet of mostly men wearing light-beige three-piece Ralph Lauren suits with a rainbow of patterned Hermès ties, who collectively looked like groomsmen at a WASPy summer wedding — and Chen, who came around to each table like the proud father, to introduce each course. (Chen was also wearing jeans, by the way, and a stained chef’s coat, looking a little schlubbier than a fine dining chef parading through his dining room usually does. I found it refreshing.) ', 'I also caught a glimpse of an elderly Asian couple wearing white socks and matching Asics, and instantly felt better about my outfit. A good reminder that this is San Francisco: underdressing always goes. ', 'The first course was a grid of mini multicolored porcelain bowls containing the “nine essential flavors” of Chinese cuisine. These bite-sized beauties tasted even better than they looked: sweet, a jujube date bursting with chrysanthemum honey; salty, sous-vide chicken coiled with cured duck-egg yolk; smoky, dark soy-marinated smelt wok-fried then smoked; numbing, paper-thin slices of beef tendon simmered in red and green Sichuan peppercorns that left my lips tingling until the next course. ', 'Which was a next-level shrimp har gow dumpling: a delicate, open-faced quadrant brimming with Russian golden osetra caviar, trout roe, chives, creme fraiche, encircled by dollops of uni one night, curled on top another. Scooping it, and savoring it, like a Hoodsie Cup with a mother-of-pearl spoon, it had me wishing I could flag down this creation from any old dim sum cart, anytime. ', 'But no, everything about Eight Tables is the antithesis of “anytime.” (For most civilians, it’s special-occasion time, if not once in a lifetime.) ', 'What Chen has done at Eight Tables is take standard Chinese dishes and turn them into more glamorous versions of themselves. You know, like Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. A supplemental course referred to as “beef and broccoli,” for instance, was anything but the gloppy go-to take-out order. Rather, bright-green baby bulbs of tender Gailan hearts were plated sparingly with Miyasaki A5 wagyu, marbled hunks the color of cooked rhubarb and the texture of softened butter — and worth every one of its 6,000 pennies. (Although, on another night, it was a less transcendent experience.)', 'Barbecue “shao kao” became a trio that included sweet, smoky strips of Iberico char siu with a kumquat glaze; a crisp deconstructed Cantonese-style pork-belly sandwich about half the size of a Kit Kat, with more crunch; and a crackling Peking duck skin topped with Kaluga caviar teetering over a piece of feather-light shrimp toast — maybe my favorite bite of the night, save for the mushy fish eggs (which were farmed in the Hubei province of China, and not yet quite up to snuff. Still, Chen explained, he wanted to support their efforts).', 'On my first visit, Norwegian Icelandic cod steamed in banana leaf with hot ginger scallion oil, buried with lotus root stuffed and topped with shreds of pickled white melon, was silky, mild, and memorable, but a couple of weeks later, prepared with local cod and pickled cucumber, it was too firm, dry to the point of tasting almost parched. In a place that aims for perfection, the slightest imperfection — and inconsistencies — stands out. The velvet chicken, too, suffered a similar fate. Tender breast poached in shallot oil and enmeshed in slippery, snow-white egg whites and matsutake mushrooms came blanketed in Burgundy truffles, and yet, it was a bit bland. A kind of comfort food dish I’d be happy to eat elsewhere; here it was the faintest of them all.', 'It was a blip immediately forgotten, though, with the first forkful of the unctuous red “dongpo” pork that followed. The soy-braised, thick-cut pork belly looked, and tasted, as rich as a layered chocolate cake.', '', 'We would’ve been content to consider it dessert, actually. We were about eight courses in. And — having opted for the “beverage pairing” — about eight glasses in. We began with a Gosset brut, peaked with a decadent Peter Michael Bordeaux blend (paired with that pork), and in between, enjoyed the prettiest cocktail I’ve ever sipped. The Lily Pond: a palm-sized bowl of Martin Miller’s gin and floating nasturtium, mixed with “forest water” — cucumber juice, sorrel, and red shiso, spun in a centrifuge — prepared tableside, with tweezers and a flourish of liquid nitrogen, making the cocktail the new bananas Foster. Meanwhile, my friend, who rarely drinks, and declined the pairing, was loving, and feeling, his Thai Iced Tea Milk Punch, a white rum-based wonder that was smooth and subtle and creamy, like a real Thai iced tea, made with half-and-half yet magically clear.', 'Did we really need the two desserts that followed, on the heels of a foie gras-stuffed potsticker, no less? The first was a bracing chrysanthemum granita with plum preserve, and the second was what pastry chef Luis Villavelazquez dubbed “Chinese sea grass”: passion-fruit mousse capped with pickled sea beans and crinkled seagrass rice crackers and frothing with translucent, mesquite-infused bubbles that reminded me of the time I accidentally put dish soap instead of detergent in the dishwasher. It was more spectacle than satisfying, but — and perhaps this was the point — an unforgettable finale. ', 'Did we really need any of it? Of course not. A dinner like this is all about indulgence.  ', 'So often, at other restaurants of its caliber, such indulgence comes with an air of snobbery, pretension, and an uncomfortable stiltedness. But Eight Tables isn’t supposed to feel like a restaurant. It’s supposed to feel like a private chateau. ', 'What that means, I’m not quite sure. I never dined with 17th-century Qing dynasty nobles. Nor, for that matter, with 2017 Hong Kong elite. All I know is that after four hours hanging out with Anthony and Tony, Huntly and George, it felt a little like bidding farewell to new friends. Friends who hand you a bill, in a book of Chinese poetry (and inelegantly let you know that the service charge is shared throughout the house, but “anything extra” goes to them, which required us, woozy writers, to do unnecessary math in a moment that should be frictionless). Still, they’re the kind of friends you wish could come over and mix up milk punch at your place — the kind of friends only a fortunate few are able to afford.', 'What It Costs: $225 per person, $125 per person for the wine pairing. Order anything additional, expect to reach four digits.', 'What to Drink: \xa0The traditional wine pairing includes nine exceptionally curated glasses, but go for the “beverage pairing” — you still get seven wines as well as three cocktails, including that Lily Pond. If you’re going to “start with a cocktail,” beware: They start at twenty bucks. ', 'What to eat: Everything they serve you. Tack on the “beef and broccoli.” At this point, WHY NOT. ', 'Bonus Tip: A host is stationed at the top of the alley, by the gate, to show you the way. Also, there’s a ninth table: the chef’s table ($325/person) with an optional pairing at $225.']"

A tasting menu. And we wished one weeknight. Though, unlike most, it wasn’t a big to-do, or, at $75 per person, a boggling bill. It just allowed us to sample anywhere from nine to 12 dishes in four courses — and catch up, without having to agonize over the brief but beguiling menu.', 'Like we did on ensuing visits: ', 'Should we get the meaty Pt. Reyes lingcod in a lightly creamy nori beurre blanc scattered with perfect fingerling potatoes, sweet onions, and pearls of Manila clams? (We should.) What about the wild nettle tagliatelle in a tangle of bacon, egg yolk, peppercorns, and pangrattato? (Most definitely.) The ricotta malfatti stuffed with chanterelles, cauliflower, and French sorrel? (Dry and dull; that’s the one entree we should’ve skipped.)', 'What about the tomatoes? “Nah, a tomato is a tomato,” my friend declared, arguing that he could slice and drizzle olive oil over the same fruit at home. But the firm, sweet, multihued heirloom hunks, sprinkled with sea salt and sprigs of basil, won him over. Proving that when a restaurant like Octavia offers you tomatoes on a warm September eve, you bite.', 'A $14 avocado, however? You’re welcome to balk. “It’s a Brokaw avocado,” the server explained, seemingly as unsure as we were what exactly that meant. Clearly it was code for pricey avocado, albeit one that was as smooth and creamy as a savory pot de creme. Covered with broccolini and crisp quinoa, however, it looked more like a Chia Pet.', 'Any moments of mediocrity were fleeting: Chalky chickpea poppyseed sable crackers overpowered otherwise delightful pickled anchovies on one night, plump mussels with smoked pimenton another. But at least both were only a one-bite, six-buck disappointment. A palm-sized bowl of chilled squid-ink noodles with bottarga and fennel, in a pungent lemon agrumato, appeared to be a nightly staple, but unfortunately tasted more like next-day Bento box leftovers pulled from the fridge. After giving them a second chance on my second visit, I guiltlessly snubbed them on my third.', 'But that allowed for an encore order of the delicata squash — brawny, beautiful, donut-sized rings coated in a thin, crisp, tempura batter accompanied by a puddle of citrusy aioli and dash of chile. ', 'On one night our petit filet begged for an extra pinch of salt. But that was okay, because lo and behold! There were actually mini ramekins of salt on every table. Fitting, as Octavia is not a place that emanates ego. ', 'Rather, it exudes intentionality. From the open kitchen framed like a painting to each piece of earth-toned pottery by Berkeley’s Sarah Kersten to Perello’s fostering of female chefs, like executive pastry chef Sarah Bonar, who also does the desserts for Frances, and now chef de cuisine Sara Hauman, a 2015 Eater Young Gun, who came on in April off a stint as sous chef at Mister Jiu’s, by way of Huxley and Bar Agricole before that. (She actually got her start cooking at health spas in San Diego; she’s obviously back on butter — and for that my lingcod and I were grateful.)', 'Our only complaint about Octavia was that every starter we ordered arrived at once — also intentionally so. Receiving that dreamy deviled egg at the same time as the chickpea crackers, at the same time as the delicata squash, at the same time as Bonar’s purple barley levain, which is baked daily downstairs? Too much. The egg deserved our undivided attention! Then, fine, let the other dishes follow.', 'Desserts, on the other hand: bring ’em on. The more of Bonar’s creations the merrier. Our spoons dove eagerly back and forth between subtle treats that were acutely seasonal. And not in a Starbucks Pumpkin Spice way.

Artery. Chicken heart. Spam. It’s hard to think of a steakhouse, chophouse, or quite frankly any American restaurant that affordably serves more varieties of meat (or heck, vegetables) than MáLà Project, the fiery fever dream of a Sichuan spot with locations in the East Village and, as of six weeks ago, Bryant Park. ', 'It’s just as tough to think of another culinary establishment that serves all of its wok-fried morsels in brown woven salad bowls. The kitchen sticks a foot-long wooden spoon into each communal serving — the kind used to mix romaine with vinaigrette — so that guests can toss duck tongues, oyster mushrooms, bok choy, five spice tofu, and sugary Chinese bacon into the puddle of chile oil sloshing around the bottom. ', 'The chefs garnish this masterpiece with a fistful of cilantro. That’s my kind of salad.', 'The dish in question is dry pot, a broth-free cousin of sorts to the traditional Sichuan hot pot — where guests dip raw meats into flame-fired crocks of chile-laced beef tallow or soup. “By the end of the meal, I was almost delirious with heat,” journalist Fuchsia Dunlop wrote in her memoirs of a formative hot pot meal. “My mouth burned and tingled,” she added, describing the blend of buzzing, Novocaine-like numbingness and heat known as málà. “My body ran with sweat. I felt ragged and molten. Pain and pleasure were indistinguishable,” Dunlop wrote. ', 'MáLà’s own dry pots traffic in precisely those sensations, though I’d politely suggest the pain and pleasure were quite distinguishable, with sometimes more of the latter than the former. Spam, normally a non-violent luncheon meat, feels like oral acupuncture here. A slice of pineapple, like a desert mirage, promises relief, until the flecks of pepper cause one’s tongue to vibrate. ', 'Eye round of beef, sliced paper thin and crumpled up like a discarded sheet of looseleaf paper, acts as a sponge to the crimson oil. It evokes the sensation of consuming a French dip soaked in gunpowder tincture, then swallowing a match.', 'The fact that one keeps eating, despite the agony, is enough to make a rational diner question the nature of free will in the universe, or at least wonder what the heck they’re putting in here besides chiles. The answer, incidentally, is a lot; the spice blend includes black cardamom, orange peel, crushed gardenias, lesser galangal, nutmeg, and female ginseng. ', 'Also worth noting: The lunchtime beef bowls ($13) cost less than an Omega Bowl from Sweetgreen.', 'MáLà is brought to us by Amelie Kang, a 26-year-old Tangshan native who studied at the Culinary Institute of America, and Meng Ai, who graduated NYU in 2016 with a masters in financial engineering. The savvy entrepreneurs, who hope to continue expanding, are part of a small but growing number of current or former Chinese university students who are opening restaurants across the U.S., giving voice to the diverse foodways of their homeland. Case in point: just next door to MáLà in the East Village is The Tang, a noodle shop opened by two NYU seniors last year.', 'New York of course has long benefited from a surfeit of excellent Sichuan spots. What MáLà brings to the table isn’t so much a creative riff on a regional cuisine, common for younger chefs, as a smart repackaging of it. ', 'Traditional Sichuan venues ply their trade in environs that some might call utilitarian, with bright lighting, bar televisions, and tablecloths. MáLà’s two (equally awesome) locations, by contrast, adopt the visual lexicon of a stereotypically hip downtown establishment, employing brick walls, custom neon signage, communal tables, bench seating, waiters in distressed jeans, and carefully curated beer lists. ', 'It would be easy to dismiss this all as branding, to argue that MáLà is simply pandering to a ubiquitous notion of stylishness. But there’s also something to be said for using modern design tropes as a counterpoint to the classically-minded food, which comes courtesy of chef Qilong Zhao, a Chengdu native.', 'Hao Noodle in the Village and Birds of a Feather in Bushwick generally abide by the same modish ethos. Together with MáLà, they form the Sichuan analogues to Keith McNally’s crowded brasseries, everyday places for the cool kids to hang out and grab some well-executed, non-cheffed up grub.', 'Liangfen ($8), arrive the way they’re typically served, the slithery mung bean noodles doused in a light oil, with just enough zing to warm up one’s palate for the more incendiary dry pot. Equally mild are the dan dan, a pitch perfect rendition of the classic noodles tossed with oyster sauce, chile, and numbing ground beef. ', 'Slightly spicier is the husband and wife special, the famous Sichuan salad of tripe and lung, the former as snappy as shaved green apple, the latter packing a cool concentrated beefiness. For a firmer texture, a few degrees north of jerky, dried pig’s ear is a wonderfully leathery snack to last the duration of the meal. ', 'Anyone who hasn’t tried a thousand year egg would be well served to order it here; the two month cure of clay, ash, and quicklime turns the firm white into a gelatinous black and the soft yolk into a gooey, pudding-like green. The flavor is distinctly mild (these can trend quite sulfurous), even more so when paired with shishito peppers and dunked in the accompanying pool of sweet soy. ', 'One could subsist on small plates and dim sum here alone, but that would mean missing out on the main event.', 'Not too long ago, writers like Josh Ozersky were championing the virtues of nose-to-tail gastronomy, and chefs like David Chang were dedicating proper menu real estate to offal. How things have changed. Restaurants in 2018 highlight sweetbreads and other off cuts with less frequency, while the same sleepy steak for two from the same celebrity butcher seems to sell just about everywhere. ', 'Sichuan spots have always been outliers in this regard, dishing out tripe and tongue long before and after they’d fallen in and out of vogue. What makes MáLà Project a particularly compelling way to enjoy these cuts is that portions are tiny; diners build dry pots out of five or so items per person from a selection of nearly 70 ingredients.', 'So a bet on tendon (as gelatinous as a gummy bear), lamb stomach (packing the barnyard tang of the namesake animal times ten), or artery (all the flavor of a handball shaved over a mandoline) can be hedged with heady chicken thigh, sweet crab sticks, delicate shrimp balls, overcooked pork ribs, or glass noodles. ', 'Keep in mind that the noodles efficiently soak up a lot the chile oil; they will turn the insides of even a sturdy gourmand into a nuclear generator. Another technical point: MáLà’s namesake numbingness is decidedly low level; this is a good thing for those who find the food at, say, Mission Chinese, to feel like a shot of novocaine from the dentist. Others might try New Legend in Chelsea for a more balanced buzz.', 'The dry pot feels suited to a generation of eaters raised on small plates and dietary restrictions; even a party of two can sample a butcher’s dozen worth of ingredients. And since MáLà lets diners order individual pots, a vegetarian in a larger group can have a proper feast of their own, instead of having to lobby the omnivores at the table for a few orders of greens. ', 'A smart meat-free order would be soft enoki mushrooms, thin-sliced potatoes, chewy rice cakes, crispy lotus root, black wood ear mushrooms (floppy yet firm, like perfectly cooked lasagna sheets), or any other infinite combination of vegetables coated in insane quantities of chile.', 'Seek relief with Sixpoint Bengali ale, redolent of rose, or a can of “Milk Drink,” a sweet blend of condensed milk and milk powder equipped with a bendable plastic straw. Though really, neither quells the pain with any type of efficiency. The desserts, from the black sesame jelly to the sweet fried pumpkin cake, do a better job at cooling off one’s insides.

One could write essays tracing the lineage of this technique and spend hours trying to discern its meaning, but the practical effect is unquestionable: Diners experience a gentle surprise in an experience not unlike unwrapping a birthday present.', 'So the story goes that Jean-Georges Vongerichten, once a culinary trendsetter himself, has brought this technique to Public Kitchen, a new hotel restaurant on the Lower East Side. The dish in question is frico, traditionally a humble Friulian snack of fried cheese crisps. But here, in a hip corner of Manhattan, it takes the form of a large disc of cheddar. It magically hovers above the plate, hinting at something more underneath. Is it a few slices of fatty pork jowl? Nope. The surprise is a handful of stale popcorn.

Those who continue to walk back will encounter the restaurant, guarded by a host who, on at least one occasion, knows to reflexively look down at his little host computer (not up to make eye contact) when a patron approaches.', 'I fondly remember the first time I was escorted past the privacy screens into the restaurant itself. Chefs behind a marble counter retrieved second-rate pizzas from the fiery hearth, while waiters carried plates of zucca pasta with bacon and jalapenos, a preparation whose thin flavors recalled takeout from a mall food court. Brown wood beams crisscrossed the ceiling, a handsome juxtaposition to the (plastic) ivy that hangs in the rear garden. I admired this elegant ballet before sitting down and realizing my right hand was gently sticking to the bottom of my chair, my fingers apparently coated in a veneer of someone else’s soy-ginger sauce. Or whatever it was.', 'In the late ’90s and early aughts, Vongerichten was the chef rethinking fine dining in New York, seamlessly weaving Asian sensibilities into haute French cuisine, serving impossibly affordable lunch tastings at his eponymous Central Park West flagship, and helping launch the careers of experimentalists like Wylie Dufresne and Johnny Iuzzini. ', 'In 2017, Vongerichten is a slightly more complicated internationalist, presiding over an empire of nearly 40 establishments and concepts across the world. A handful of these venues are ambitious and distinctive. In 2010, his ABC Kitchen helped spark our prevailing vegetable- and toast-heavy zeitgeist, while his AbcV, in 2017, continued that trend with bold vegan flavors (and Juicero machines).

Even Manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it’s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.', 'lobster, frico with popcorn, and black truffle pizza', 'Dishes with an Asian bent, the chef’s longtime comfort zone, feel less like revolutionary imports and more like they’ve been appropriated from the corporate commissaries of clubstaurants like Tao or Buddakan.

Anyone armed with a box of Gorton’s and a toaster oven could achieve more texture.', 'It’s ironic that a bad meal from Vongerichten, who holds three Michelin stars at his flagship, isn’t something new or out of the ordinary; the New York Times dealt him goose eggs for V Steakhouse in 2004 and Mercer Kitchen in 2006. But as restaurants around town struggle with labor costs and skyrocketing rents, the abject awfulness of Public serves as a cynical lesson for chefs who are transitioning from being brash, we-might-fail-any-day envelope-pushers to conservative middle agers. That lesson is you can still draw in throngs of fashionistas and magazine editors — Public might actually be a tougher reservation than The Grill — with poorly executed greatest hits. ', 'Take the black truffle pizza, a dish Vongerichten offers in too many locations to help pay the rent and serve as a “you’re back at home” totem for jet-set diners. I still remember the first time I sampled it uptown at The Mark, where it was gently crispy and filled with the potent musk of wet earth. At Public, the kitchen charred the exterior crust to a carbonic black, while the interior drooped flaccidly. The signature fungi paste, in turn, exhibited the color and texture of wet mud. ', 'Among New York’s fanciest French chefs, Vongerichten has never been known for particularly compelling service, but the staff at Public find a way to make the concessioners at Yankee stadium look four-star by comparison.', 'I tell a bartender I’m waiting to eat at the counter. “We don’t really take names,” he replies. After waiting for an hour I finally snag seats and ask for a menu. “What kind of menu?” How about a dinner menu! ', 'I ask how the steak is prepared. The answer: “Rare. Medium rare. Medium. Medium well.” The correct answer is that the strip is marinated in soy and dressed in a fermented black-bean dressing. Neither seasoning does much to salvage the commodity-quality beef, which boasts all the flavor of grilled seitan. ', 'Food comes out as it’s prepared. This means that if you order two pizzas for the table, one comes out as a mid-course, while the second, which you’re happy the kitchen forgot because you’re getting a bit frustrated by the point, magically appears when you’re just about done with your mains. That second pizza, incidentally, isn’t so much an actual pizza as it is an oil-soaked sponge of potatoes, aged Gruyere, and bacon. ', 'Those who find themselves here would be best off ordering the the chile lobster. It tastes like chiles and lobster. ', 'Waiters will push a slightly-above-average tartufo for dessert; the more responsible decision is to leave.', 'When I try to make a follow-up reservation and see a 10:15 p.m. Sunday-night booking disappear before my eyes, OpenTable recommends I try the clubstaurant Vandal instead. It’s a clever suggestion. Vandal is almost as lousy as Public, but one’s expectations are lower (it’s the Tao Group), and the space is decorated with a collection of murals that are amusing enough to contemplate while hate eating dishes like “New York hot pretzel steak tartare.”', 'Public Kitchen, in turn, sets expectations high with the Jean-Georges name yet delivers a generically bad hotel restaurant.', 'Cost: Starters at $8-$19; pizza at $16-$22; pastas and mains at $18-$39.

82,"['If Adriano Paganini opens it, they will come. Almost immediately, there they were, swarms of diners willing to wait the quoted two hours for a table. It made me wonder: Before Barvale, where were all these people? Maybe hovering for a seat at Nopa, across the street? Maybe overpaying at Barcino, San Francisco’s other new tapas place? Maybe at Belotta or Botellón or Barzotto or Paginini’s breakout star Beretta? (Think we’re good on one-word, B-named restaurants in this town, by the way.)', 'They certainly weren’t at the short-lived La Urbana, which was probably why it closed and why the prolific Paginini snatched up the sprawling 140-seat corner spot. ', 'From the looks of it, both he and Barvale will make the rent just fine. At 6 p.m. on a recent Sunday, the place was packed. Every table taken, every barstool claimed. At least the drinking-and-standing-around area was roomy, making the vibe more wedding cocktail hour than moshpit. (Complete with six pintxos for $5, with any drink.) On one night, there was even a server passing around a tray of toothpicked freebies to ease the pain. A thoughtful touch that, I have to say, goes a long way in this Era of the Wait, and one I don’t think I’ve witnessed since the blustery sidewalk outside old-school Pacific Café, where the schlocky wine still flows. (Cc: the Tartines, Zazies, and Outerlands of the city. May we have a little treat, please?)  ', 'Our trio actually happened to show up on the early side — highly advised, as our wait was “only” 45 minutes. We were seated with gin still swirling in our seemingly bottomless stemless glasses. Of gin tonics Nos. 2 (a refreshing lemony-aloe blend balanced by celery bitters and a little vermouth), 3 (lime juice, splash of Pedro Ximénez, and a hunk of pink grapefruit), and 4 (picture the liquid, alcoholic version of saffron-cardamom-scented potpourri), I liked them all, in ascending order. ', 'I flat-out loved our server. She was as peppy as a cheerleader, but professional and, surprisingly, not annoying. She explained the menu — which, split into cold tapas (three for $16) and hot tapas (from $7 to $17), was fairly straightforward — and offered her favorites: “the atun crudo is to die for,” she said. The squid-garbanzo salpicon was nice, too. But she was beaming with pride about one dish in particular: the pulpo. “We got reviewed by Michael Bauer and his favorite dish was the pulpo,” she said. “You cannot leave here without trying the pulpo!” I would not.', '', 'But first up was my favorite: the boquerones, five shimmering, silver-white slivers, their bellies plump, their tails intact, lined up like synchronized swimmers over a spicy pimenton-spiked pool of tomato-based Iberian sauce, so good I sopped up the rest with the bread from our “charcuteria” plate. (The sauce had far more flavor than the jamon serrano anyway.) Because it’s almost a custom to finger-point and rank small plates as you eat them, my second favorite, also in the anchovy department, was the chicories covered in slabs of Manchego and doused in a creamy, fishy bagna cauda dressing. I’d go back to Barvale for this six-buck salad and a glass of Txakolina alone. ', 'Overall, I liked the tapas frias better than the hot. The escabeche tasted 10 times better than it looked, as let’s be honest: hunks of eggplant peeled, brined, then marinated resemble banana slugs, especially when snuggled in a ramekin. Fiery, slippery, and flecked with chile flakes and crisp garlic, they were immediately devoured; over toasted bread, they were even better. The morcilla-stuffed piquillo peppers were sweet and hearty. Ironically, only the “to die for!” atun crudo disappointed: lifeless cubes of tuna with microgreens and kumquats in a mild romesco were not worth the additional $4. ', 'The hot tapas were a little more hot and cold, if you will. Vegetables, like the charred cauliflower and the sauteed winter greens with pine nuts and raisins, were satisfying, if standard, staples. On the fried front, the croquetas de jamon were crisp, piping hot, and velvety-smooth; but the salt cod bunuelos were so bland and airy they seemed to dissolve on my tongue, like Claritin RediTabs. ', 'And then there was the pulpo, in all its meaty, purple-hued, tentacled glory, scattered with green olives and slices of fingerling potato (one of which accidentally fell into my friend’s mostly drunk glass of wine, undetected in the dim light by everyone but our supreme server, who swooped it away and replaced it with a full potato-free glass, free of charge).', 'I tried the pulpo on all three visits: on one, it was perfectly tender, deserving of real-life likes, not just all 1,002 (and counting) on Bauer’s Instagram. On another, the poor octopus was literally boiled to death then nearly cremated in the pan, to the point of being more crispy than chewy. And one night it was so salty and so chewy, we stopped talking for what felt like a full minute as we watched each other work our molars harder than they may have ever been worked before. ', 'Ultimately, at most Spanish restaurants in America, it’s the paella that represents, that underscores its authenticity, embodying the overall experience. At Barvale, it did too, in a different sort of way. “At Barvale,” explained our server, “paella isn’t a big commitment. It’s just another dish, not the main star.” I appreciated that in theory. After waiting so long for a table, who really wants to wait another 45 minutes for a $40 pan that must be ordered by all? ', 'Our paella arrived with everything else, on a ceramic plate, not a sizzling platter, no bigger than a personal pizza, yet still easily shareable by three. (As, notably, most dishes were. These were hefty servings as far as tapas typically go. No battling for bites here!) The heaping pile of rice and mussels and whole shrimp and clams was crammed to one side, as if it had traveled in the trunk of a car up Lombard Street. Flanked by aioli and a wedge of grilled lemon, it was… well, what you’d expect from a $17 paella masterminded to fit the mood and menu prices of any Paganini restaurant. Like the others in his ever-expanding portfolio, Barvale, too, befits its bill. ', 'For a fun, affordable, night out, it’s worth the wait — for those who are willing. What I liked best about Barvale, though, as I discovered one Tuesday eve when I wasn’t: It’s made scoring a bar stool and a burger across Divisadero a little easier. ', 'What it costs: Easily less than $100 with a carafe of wine and plenty of tapas, before tax and tip.', 'What to drink: Those gin and tonics; a carafe of Txakolina. The rose-based sangria with ginger and blood orange isn’t bad as far as sangria goes, but still, it’s sweet—and beware the hangover.', 'What to eat: Anything that involves anchovies: the boquerones, the chicories with bagna cauda; esacbeche; squid mussels garbanzo salpicon; the pulpo—on a good pulpo night.', 'Bonus tip: Beware of being accosted by a fleet of servers, as if it’s TGI Friday’s on your your birthday, armed with a porron and offering to pour house sherry down your throat with dessert.

83,"['Two stars for El Quinto Pino and Txikito in Chelsea', 'When chef Alex Raij opened El Quinto Pino in 2007, she served typical tapas — white anchovy fillets, salt cod fritters, and shrimp in garlic oil. She also offered atypical fare — a sea urchin panino.', 'The sandwich inspired an amusing game of critical one-upmanship. When Peter Meehan of the New York Times reviewed the Chelsea spot, he declared the oceanic panino the “sandwich of the year.” A few months later, blogger Andrea Strong wrote that the “unini,” as she called it, had taken on “legendary, if not mythical status.” Serious Eats then upgraded panino to “sandwich of the decade” in 2009, the same year the Frank Bruni cast a broader net, calling it an “era-defining treat.” ', 'They’re all impressive accolades for something that looked like an underbaked grilled cheese sandwich. The dish hailed from an era when restaurants didn’t calibrate visuals for social media; Instagram was still three years away and the iPhone had just debuted. ', 'Good news: The sandwich has not been beautified for the smartphone era. The only thing that’s changed is the urchin itself, which Raij says is higher quality. ', 'The pressed bread shatters when bitten. The squishy urchin bleeds neon juices. The sweet taste of uni fills your mouth — until mustard oil kicks in and stings the sinuses; that condiment doesn’t so much cleanse the palate as provide it a momentary reprieve from the funk of the sea. And while bigger restaurants — Toro and The Pool — would go on to serve uni sandwiches on toast with mustard, none have the approachable, iconic calling-card status that Raij’s does. ', 'The serving vessel was, and still is, wax paper. This is not uni as a luxury item, which it often is. This is uni as a sandwich, meant to be consumed while standing up, on the go. It is one of New York’s great dishes. ', 'As a certain strain of soul-draining monotony infects the New York dining landscape, with deep-pocketed empire builders and big-time chefs looking for The Next Big Thing, be it counter-service pasta, nouveau delivery, or quinoa-laced beet bowls, it’s refreshing that diners can still turn to a veteran, non-rock-star operator and find cuisine that’s simultaneously creative, thoughtful, and affordable. ', 'El Quinto Pino and sister spot Txikito around the block remain two of the most compelling expressions of Iberian fare in New York. The former has few equals in the sphere of tapas, while the latter might just be the city’s top Basque spot. Both fluently alternate between the traditional and the modern, between pan amb tomaca and double-patty burgers. And both do so without charging more than $30 for pretty much anything. ', 'Maybe we should all be paying less attention to new restaurants with full-time social-media coordinators or fast-casual ambitions, and more to venues that have been grinding it out for years without a place on the World’s 50 Best list. ', 'La Vara in Cobble Hill might be the Michelin-starred jewel of Raij’s tiny empire, which she runs with her co-chef and Bilbao-raised husband, Eder Montero, but that venue, an ode to the Sephardic and Moorish traditions of Spain, can command two-hour waits on a Saturday night. Neither El Quinto nor Txikito, by contrast, generate much of a queue for walk-ins. In fact both are so close to each other and the food comes out so expeditiously that one could literally hop between the two.', 'An ideal game plan: Kick off the festivities at El Quinto with cumin-spiced lamb skewers, follow up with chile- and anchovy-laced queso fundido, then scoot over to Txikito for ethereal salt cod fritters, with an interior blended to the texture of mousse and a heady flavor that evokes seafood chowder, and funky head-on shrimp.', 'Then return to Quinto for a frozen dark and stormy and rabbit paella where the yellow rice is a brilliant conveyance mechanism for the nuclear-powered aroma of saffron. ', 'One could continue eating. ', 'El Quinto began as a single tiny room. A larger dining area off to the side opened in 2013, but the heart of El Quinto is the bar room, with sconces the shape of antelope horns, wallside dining ledges as small as airline seat trays, burnished mirrors, chalkboard menus, and a curved marble counter — a classic design hack that lets solo patrons face other people instead of the bartender. ', 'The size of dishes are proportionate to the room. They are small, rarely more than a handful and a half of food. And they are often unexpectedly sweet, but never in an unwelcome fashion. ', 'Cantabrian anchovies lie on crackers adjacent to thin sticks of vanilla butter; just as the salt starts to overwhelm, the sugar-laced dairy wipes the palate clean like a milkshake. Bomba toledanas — spiced beef and potato fritters — come anointed with a thimble’s worth of habanero puree. The floral heat gently burns, until a mash of sweet peas, sitting below each croquette, cools the palate. And a pile of incendiary spreadable soppressata — essentially Spanish ’nduja — comes with a well of honey in the center, a classic Menorcan pairing that only seems foreign until you realize it’s the functional analogue to maple syrup-laced bacon.', 'Basque cuisine, at its heart, is a “cuisine of subtraction,” Raij writes in her cookbook, drawing contrast to the region’s more complex avant-gardists, from Arzak to Mugaritz. “Fancy embellishment is stripped away until you are left with the essence of an ingredient.”', 'And while El Quinto Pino is not a Basque restaurant — more about Txikito in a bit — her statement rings true. Or put differently: at El Quinto Pino, Raij and Montero use supporting flavors to deify a lead protein or vegetable. Their cooking evokes a superb three- or four-ingredient cocktail. Waiters don’t spend an hour describing the food upon presentation, because a spice or seasoning listed on the menu is apparent to the diner immediately upon consumption, without explanation or elaboration. ', 'For example: Shrimp fritters can verge into scallop-like sweetness in other hands. At Quinto, the kitchen uses brown krill to draw out the deeper, richer, mid-tide tang of XO sauce. And while Raij says she pairs plancha-singed calamari with garlic and Parmesan to evoke a pasta, the umami-rich ingredients end up producing a simpler and grander effect: They make squid taste more like squid. It is near-perfect food. ', 'Txikito is the slightly more creative restaurant, with certain refinements (no sandwiches, no burgers) and a somewhat heavier nod to seafood, in deference to the Basque love of all things maritime. ', 'Even the fries here, doused in paprika, arrive with a ramekin of cod-laced mayo. ', 'Like at Quinto, the cooks sear squid on the plancha, only they slice them into spaghetti-like ribbons and drape them over a puree of pine nuts with onions. They riff on txangurro, the traditional stuffed crab, by slicking the shellfish with cream cheese, warming it under the broiler, and lighting it ablaze with the very non-Basque sriracha; it packs as much crustacean flavor as a good crabcake yet it costs just $8.', 'The kitchen shreds skate wing with parsley coulis, fried garlic, dill, and cilantro, treating fish as if it is a salad ingredient meant to be tossed in a verdant and fragrant salad of herbs. It’s the type of dish one might expect at the two-Michelin-starred Aska.', 'Guests have more elbow room at Txikito. The bar is just a little bit longer. The wood-paneled walls don’t need windows to create the illusion of space. The garage-like front opens up during the spring, and sidewalk tables appear outside. It’s something to dream about until things get warmer. ', 'Until then, make do with the homemade Navarran sausage, a semi-firm “rope,” as the menu calls it, of pork jowl cut with paprika. The smoke of that spice is brilliantly restrained, recalling a charcoal grill’s dying embers.', 'Raij forges chewy little gnocchi out of shrimp and iberico; the pink surf-and-turf nuggets, tasting simultaneously of shellfish and aged ham, arrive in a delicate squid ink sauce. Ropa vieja, the Cuban dish of shredded steak with peppers, is de rigueur as well. Txikito substitutes brisket and stuffs it into green peppers, balancing the meatiness of the protein against the vegetal tang of the capsicum. Softening the richness further is a layer of yogurt and a whisper of non-traditional yuzu oil; Raij tells me that for most of the dishes, she provides the inspiration, while Montero, a native of Basque country, pushes back when necessary. ', 'Lemon cake, cut with orange-flower water, makes for a fine dessert. But it’s also hard not to resist dropping by El Quinto again for a sea urchin sandwich to go. During a year when so many new restaurants are soporific at best, spending all the more time at venues we’ve overlooked is a pleasant act of gastronomic protest.', 'Cost: Most tapas and sandwiches at $16 or under; many dishes under $10.', 'Sample Dishes: Squid a la plancha with parmesan and black garlic, shrimp and chickpea fritters, Moorish spiced lamb skewers, beef croquettes with habanero and sweet pea puree.', 'Bonus Tip: The uni panini is rock star dish here, but do not sleep on the anchovies with vanilla or the Menorcan sausage with honey.', '', 'Cost: All bites (pintxos) at $10 or less; larger portions at $10-$20, with a few specials in the $20s and $30s.', 'Sample Dishes: Salt cod croquetas, crab toasts, chorizo hash sandwiches, squid ribbons over pine nut puree, homemade Navvaran sausage rope.\xa0']"
84,"['I love the East Bay. I just hate getting there. All San Franciscans do (and our friends who live there rightfully mock us for it). It’s the bridge! It’s BART! It’s the random midday standstill traffic for No Freaking Reason! And it’s worse than ever. Our divide is growing wider. Our loyalties are shifting. Our friendships are suffering.', 'But the food scene… the food scene to the east is flourishing. It has been for a while, of course, as chefs ditch the city for cheaper rents, easier permits, a more laid-back crowd — and mostly for Oakland. Berkeley has fallen behind in the restaurant renaissance. So when a friend who knows her stuff texted me about a promising new spot that opened, in October, out in Albany of all places, I was intrigued. In part, I admit, because it was called Juanita & Maude (chef-owner Scott Eastman’s grandmother and mom, respectively). I’m a sucker for old-lady names.', 'For a restaurant to lure us — to lure me — anywhere across the bay on a weeknight, it’s got to be good. Fortunately, my first foray beyond city limits as Eater SF critic was worth the commute.', 'I took the Transbay bus, actually, and it was kind of amazing. I had a clean seat to myself. I watched the sky turn pink and the water sparkle. And it dropped me right there, on the corner of San Pablo and Solano. A sleepy, suburbanesque strip where the only coffee shop was an old-school Royal Ground and the most fashionable restaurant nearby was Rivoli, which opened in, oh, 1994.', 'At the bar of Juanita & Maude ', '“We needed a place like this,” said two different friends from the neighborhood, on two separate visits. By a place like this, they meant a place that’s urbane, organic, and open after 9. A place with locally sourced, lovingly made food, without wailing kids or anything remotely resembling pizza. They mean a place like Juanita & Maude — arguably the best thing to hit the North Berkeley area since… Whole Foods?', 'Fronted by large windows, the place was light if narrow, with walnut and warm lighting. It felt a little like an East Bay Frances (the Castro’s Michelin-starred spot, named after Melissa Perello’s grandmother). With elevated comfort food to match — and a neighborhood crowd that was more gray than gay. ', 'Coming from a Neverland like San Francisco, I appreciated it. I also valued the oh-so Berkeley vibe. Professorial men wrapped in plaid scarves, frumpy ladies draped in floral prints, a solo dude adorned in a bowtie, and multiple diners absorbed in musty library books. The food itself, though, was anything but: fresh, lively, current. ', 'The menu was more interesting than you’d expect from a quiet neighborhood place cooking “American cuisine."" But as the website’s home page explains, this is chef Scott Eastman’s personal take on it — inspired by his varied culinary career cooking at Scandinavian, Japanese, and Italian restaurants. Now, at Juanita & Maude, he’s free to add a splash of Polish or German or French when he feels like it. As our server put it: “The chef felt stifled by the rules.” After almost a decade pulling pasta at Berkeley’s Corso, “he was ready to have some fun.”', 'Upon first glance, it seemed like maybe he was having a little too much fun, as the menu didn’t quite make sense. Did I really want massive rosemary-chile-marinated Castelvetrano olives with my hamachi crudo with my chanterelle and whipped chevre strudel? As it turned out, I did. Juanita & Maude was like a surprising 23 and Me result: a little bit of everything — and I was into it.', 'Even if I wasn’t into every dish. The New York steak tasted as firm and flavorless as a poorly cooked pork chop; its accompanying pommes frites were fine, albeit aching for salt. (At $34 dollars for three small slabs, it was also overpriced.) ', 'The quinoa, listed as simply Quinoa, was not much more than that: a seemingly bottomless bowl of bland. I like quinoa at home and, really, anywhere other than Eatsa, but it was a tad too soft, supposedly mixed with soy and pickled chile, as well as a few hunks of shiitake and sprigs of spigarello, but it needed more of all of it. On another night, though, they dubbed the quinoa dish donburi, and it was fiery and flavorful, with shiitake and sesame, citrus and soy vinaigrette. That was a quinoa I could get behind.', 'But the gnocchi I’d put on a pedestal. I say this as someone who has long ranked gnocchi toward the bottom of her pasta preferences (but above bowtie). Pillowy, potato-y, and perfect, it came touched in a creamy tomato sauce with a splash of sambuca one night, as cacio e pepe on another. Of everything I ate over three nights, it was this simple Parmesan, pepper, and pecorino dish I’m still thinking about. ', 'Actually, the fleshy Hamachi crudo flanked by a mound of superfresh avocado mash is still floating around my mind, too. As is that flaky, savory, phyllo strudel and a dreamy duck sausage with a butter bean ragout. Not to mention my dessert: a chocolate mousse, so 2009 I could barely stand to order it, but I’m glad I did. Buried with cocoa nibs and house-made graham cracker; topped with a sticky, honey-cinnamon meringue; and served up, like an Irish coffee from Buena Vista Cafe, it made chocolate mousse new again.

85,"['With a revamped menu, the Williamsburg hotel restaurant is more than a brunch one-trick pony', 'One of the most insightful messages in The French Laundry Cookbook, a classic tome that has inspired and frustrated scores with painstaking elevations of American cuisine, is that something as simple as pomme purees — humble mashed potatoes — can be strikingly complicated. In fact, it might be “the most difficult recipe here,” the authors wrote, “because there are so many small choices that make a big impact.”', 'It’s a lesson worth recalling at Reynard in Williamsburg’s Wythe Hotel, in case anyone’s inclined to dismiss the pumpkin puree — humble mashed squash — as yet another plate of marked-up Thanksgiving nostalgia. ', 'Christina Lecki, who joined as head chef this summer after leading April Bloomfield’s Michelin-starred kitchen at The Breslin for years, makes a bevy of infinitely small choices that add up to big flavor. This is true of all her fire-kissed American cuisine, the product of a wood-burning hearth in the kitchen, but it is especially true of her shockingly complex pumpkin.', 'Lecki uses the dying embers at the end of service to slowly roast her pumpkins overnight. The next day, she purees the collapsed gourds; cooks them down with chicken stock and onions; fortifies them with buttermilk; laces them with chile, cinnamon, and nutmeg; passes them through a chinois for silkiness; ladles them into a small brown wooden bowl; and finishes them with a pat of kefir butter.', 'The pumpkin accompanies a half chicken that’s been smoked and roasted, which is great in its own right, but believe me when I say that bird is just a supporting player. The puree takes on the color of rust and sports the texture of ice cream. The flavors range from vegetal to sweet to gently tangy (from the kefir), with lingering notes of Christmas spices. And unlike a fancy French pommes puree, or an overindulgent polenta, the butter here is used with restraint; it never detracts from the essence of the pumpkin. ', 'It is best consumed on a cold day, watching the neon of Wythe Avenue light up the falling snow. Add a touch of the chicken’s vinegar- and offal-laced gravy for extra oomph, and take pleasure in consuming one of New York’s next great dishes. ', 'Since it opened nearly six years ago, Reynard’s identity hasn’t so much centered around the food or the chef as it has around the urban ethos of its operator, Andrew Tarlow. The hospitality guru rose to fame at his restaurants Diner and Marlow & Sons, where menus scrawled on receipt tape, carpentry contracted from local artisans, and meats sourced from local farms helped shape the Kings County restaurant identity and solidify a global image of #Brooklyn as an exportable brand of crafty hipness. ', 'Reynard is a touch spiffier than Tarlow’s other venues. It felt, in the early days, like a gently commercialized hagiography of Williamsburg’s industrial past, a clean-cut blend of reclaimed wood ceilings, scratched mirrors, patterned tile floors, and distressed brick walls, all in a reasonably priced hotel that boasted killer views of Manhattan. The natural wine list was awesome, the natural light was killer for photo-friendly brunches, and the straightforward American fare was, well, straightforward. But it never wowed.', 'Five years later, Reynard has earned its patina. The dining room feels like a refuge from the neighborhood’s current state of Disneyfication, with more and more exorbitant apartment buildings of glass and steel choking up the skyline, and with proliferating street-mural adverts commissioned by the likes of Spotify, Microsoft, Delta, and Tinder.', 'And the food, with its service-included pricing, now deserves its own narrative. It finally wows. Lecki’s all-day American fare makes hearth cooking feel like the primal — yet studied — act of deliciousness it should be, rather than the performative and pedestrian act it’s become in too many restaurants installing Cadillac grills. Her creations, more gutsy than gut-busting, are lighter and brighter than much of what she put out at The Breslin, with no fatty steaks for two, with acid used strategically, and with the flavor of fire feeling more like a subtle background note than an overwhelming act of quasi-barbecue.', 'Consider the pig’s face — a bit of an acquired taste. Lecki makes it user-friendly by heating it up on the griddle, rendering all the gelatinous bits soft, and bringing out the dish’s porcine perfume. She lays a small pile of lettuce on the side for wrapping, along with a little bit of pickled jalapenos to cut through the fats with spice and zing. There’s your Italian-American bo ssam right there. ', 'Lecki gets more aggressive with the fire in her urchin course. She torches pita over the wood coals, dusts it with a speckle of house-made togarashi, and pairs the piping-hot flatbread with cold Massachusetts uni on the half shell. This bread and butter course — with its palate shocking chaud-froid — brilliantly uses the heat of the chile and the smoke of the grill to tame the squishy funk of the sea.', 'To achieve this level of precision, Lecki had Tarlow and a local steelworker remove the kitchen’s old Argentinian grill, whose raw-wood style of cooking could overpower ingredients with acridity, she tells me. In its place, Tarlow installed a plancha and hanging racks, allowing for more controlled cooking. ', 'Garlic slowly smokes while hanging over the hearth; cooks squeeze the sweet pulp into a soul-warming soup fortified with leftover meat stock, squishy pecorino breadcrumbs, and tangy whey. The yellow broth’s opacity belies its nimble flavors; it nearly vibrates on the tongue. The portion is not small, but because of its balance, it manages to work as an appetizer for one.', 'This being Reynard, of course, it’s likely some readers and regulars have a very specific question: How’s brunch? Well, it’s great, but it’s lightened up a bit. Translation: The famed Dutch pancake, often laden with ham and Gruyere, has been banished from the menu.', 'Instead, diners will encounter delicate egg crepes and crisp socca — southern French chickpea pancakes topped with a tangle of burnished cauliflower and a smattering of za’atar. ', 'Maple-glazed ham arrives as a single pink slice, the thickness of cardboard and curled at the edges from a proper smoking. The meat packs notes of salt and sugar, with a dusting of aji dulce for a fruity heat. Paired with soft, prosciutto-studded collards and two poached eggs, the Southern-leaning dish never veers into nap-inducing territory; the portion size will leave the non-boozing brunch patron feeling refreshed. Same goes for the roast beef, cooked rare, sliced thin, and slathered in horseradish sauce over chicories. It reads like a steakhouse lunch on the menu; it turns out to be a nimbly beefy salad in disguise.', 'Back at dinner, Lecki lights up the grill for house-ground merguez, a loosely packed sausage stuffed with lamb hearts, liver, kidneys, and fermented red chiles. She lets the warm, smoky, gamy flavors build, and then uses a verdant cilantro and parsley salad to cleanse the palate. ', 'She fries plump East Coast oysters and wraps them in tender lettuces. She sears ’nduja-stuffed squid to an ethereal creaminess. She pan-sears Peconic Bay scallops, leaving the interior cool and rare, while imparting the exterior with a complex campfire char.

86,"['The East Coast debut of Chicago’s most celebrated fine dining team fails to make an impact', 'Once upon a time, there was an East Village wonderland called Booker and Dax, a magically boozy place that sprinkled pixie dust over the city’s largely classical and overly serious cocktail scene. Bartenders caramelized drinks with blazing-hot pokers and clarified ripe bananas into rum with centrifuges and froze basil leaves with liquid nitrogen. The complex techniques and wacky flavors made it the city’s only fully experimental bar. And somehow it was also an accessible experiment, with $14 drinks, $12 ham plates, and no reservations.', 'It closed in 2016, but less than a year later, New York again has a modernist cocktail parlor, albeit in a slightly different latitude and altitude: the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental on Columbus Circle. The Aviary, a spinoff of the Chicago original, is the long-awaited East Coast debut from the folks behind Alinea, a world-renowned gastronomic playpen where chefs send out fried chicken liver mousse made to look like volcanic ash, and where patrons suck the helium out of green apple taffy balloons.', 'So it’s no surprise when The Aviary’s bartenders — a loose term, as the bar is a glass-walled kitchen — send out the following bit of whimsy: coffee-laced Manhattans in clear bags filled everything-bagel perfume. A server cuts open the bag and the scent lingers for just a second. It is only transportive in the sense that it evokes something New Yorkers eat every day for a buck. Here, that aroma and the very average mix of rye and vermouth it perfumes cost $27. ', 'The Aviary, alas, isn’t as accessible of an experiment as the dearly departed Booker and Dax. It is, however, a great place to Instagram cocktails, if that’s your thing. Perhaps you’ve seen photos of that bagel drink juxtaposed against the Central Park skyline, with the restaurant’s branding emblazoned on the bag? The staff will even offer to ’gram for you if your drink has a particularly intense interactive element.', 'If only The Aviary were also a great place to drink those cocktails. Or pair food with them. Bar snacks, typically a category of cuisine that’s meant to nourish (and dampen the effects of alcohol) trend in the direction of internationally eclectic hors d’oeuvres here at The Mandarin. The bites are geared toward whetting the palate and draining the wallet, from the rustically expensive — a pork rind the size of a small child for $17 — to the nearly unshareable — about three bites of kampachi ceviche with Thai green curry for $24 — to the wholly unshareable — Alinea’s raviolo of black truffle juice, a single bite for $18.', 'For those who care to avoid the wait for walk-ins, reserving a seat requires non-refundable deposits to the tune of $40 to $100 per couple in the evenings. If same-week a la carte spots are in short supply, it’s often easier to reserve for cocktail and canape tastings, running $280 or more for two after tax and service, a spendy reality that smacks of we’ll-only-book-you-for-bottle-service elitism.', 'The deposit-style booking process also applies to the sister spot next door, The Office, a windowless ode to leather and wood that serves cocktails that are more creatively traditional than avant-garde. Think: amaretto sours laced with black truffle or Old Fashioneds infused with notes of banana and miso. It also serves beef tartare for $45. And Iberico ham plates for $64. Like The Aviary, or much of New York, it feels designed for a particular tax bracket.', 'To be fair, The Aviary, the focus of this review, and The Office remain true to their haute origins. Frontmen Nick Kokonas and chef Grant Achatz are largely luxury restaurateurs; dinner for two at Alinea can easily run $1,050 or more. The Aviary, in turn, has been a spendy affair since its Chicago debut in 2011. That bar, according to its own website, is where “cocktails and service are given the same attention to detail as a four-star restaurant.”', 'That description, however immodest, feels apt when imbibing the “Bring Another Smurf,” a cocktail that involves a layer of white-coconut cordial sitting underneath a purple frozen disc of pea flower-infused mezcal. It arrives in a freestanding glass pipe. You blow to mix the components. Then you inhale. The stem liquid tastes strongly of booze and lime, while the aroma from the fat tobacco end of the pipe is pure tropical fruit. The drink doesn’t so much evoke a margarita as it does something Dumbledore might imbibe in a Harry Potter novel.', 'Just as exhilarating is the gin and tonic. It’s a blend of Bombay Sapphire, apple, almond, and frozen cucumber that looks like a mad scientist’s green beaker, drinks like a slushie, and packs a level of vibrantly fizzy carbonation that almost borders on Alka Seltzer.', 'That G&T is $21. That not a bad thing, per se. As wine pairings sometimes approach the price of tasting menus, and as martinis often cost more than a burger, there’s something to be said for spending a few extra dollars on bespoke cocktails that, arguably, inspire at the same level as a composed dish that likely took as long to create. ', 'But value is a product of more than just a few fantastic drinks. The bad news is the larger experience of spending an hour or two at The Aviary isn’t quite as splendid as it should be at these prices. The bar, despite its seductive curvilinear sofas, feels like an extension of the hotel lobby. Giant windows overlook Central Park, but the Mandarin’s brightly lit reception area reflects back, partially obscuring the vistas. And the lounge-y soundtrack evokes the inane background music in a luxury car advert.', 'Meanwhile, some of The Aviary’s other drinks fail to live up to their prices.', 'Take the “Science A.F.” The complex and compelling elements of a penicillin — ginger, lemon, and scotch — are sucked up into a heated vacuum coffee chamber, tableside, where they’re all warmed up and infused with blueberry meritage tea. The resulting product, poured over ice cubes that melt quickly, has all the color, complexity, and flavor of watery Hi-C. Cost: $28.', 'Consider “In the Rocks,” an Old Fashioned encapsulated in a sphere of ice. Diners break it apart with a modified slingshot. It splatters cold shards of ice on the tables, and it results in a glass of under-diluted scotch, a bit of cassis, and none of the Sichuan peppercorn the menu promises. It comes with a half a glass of Champagne and costs $29. ', 'In the mood for a bloody mary? The kitchen places five tiny garnishes not on the rim of a highball, as is the norm, but on an elevated glass tray. Those bites, which include a littleneck clam with spicy cucumber, as well as a little knob of tomato-horseradish gelee, are uncomplicatedly refreshing. Then comes the bloody itself. A server pours it into a hole in the middle of the garnish tray, funneling the liquid into a small glass bowl filled with fresno pepper ice balls. It starts out as lukewarm, without any compelling acidity, then finishes as spicy and watery, without any compelling acidity. The cost is $38, more than a typical hanger steak.', 'Pro tip: Do not make reservations for The Aviary’s tastings. Cocktail lounges are more pleasant when you don’t risk your own money on a pre-purchase agreement for a set amount of alcoholic beverages 14 days out. Make the decision on how much to booze up when you show up.', 'Another tip: Skip the ramen, an appetizer-sized portion of mushroom dashi and insubstantial noodles for $27. The chawanmushi is also a miss; the delicate Japanese custard should tremble on the spoon like a flan that’s only barely set. Here, it sports the denser consistency of a gently overcooked pot de creme. ', 'The A5 wagyu steak is the steal of the menu for $29. It’s all you need to understand the powerful beefiness and luxurious fattiness that this cut provides, and it’s an entirely better deal than at other venues, which typically charge $100 for unnecessarily large portions. ', 'Finish with the pineapple, the sweet fruit acting as a foil to savory mole, or end with the white dessert, a plate whose monochromatic palette belies a stunning collection of textures and flavors, from coconut ice cream to lime sorbet to cashew pudding and tonka bean meringue. Pair it with the carrot cake cocktail, a simple riff on the Ramos Fizz (egg white, gin, lemon) that tastes precisely of the cream cheese-studded sweet.', 'So that’s The Aviary. It might fulfill the needs of a luxury hotel, but it doesn’t represent the bright future of avant-garde cocktailery.', 'Cost: Expect to spend over $125 per person, assuming three drinks each and a selection of small plates. Cocktails range from $18-$38; the average price is $23. All bites are $29 or under. Cocktail and bite tastings run $110, $165, or $215 per person.', 'Sample Drinks: Wake and Bake (pillow, orange, everything bagel, coffee, rye), Science A.F. (blueberry, lemon, ginger, honey, scotches), Carrot Cake Ramos (rooibos, cream cheese, walnut), In the Rocks (cassis, Sichuan peppercorn, scotch, bourbon, Champagne).', 'Sample Dishes: Black truffle explosion (raviolo with truffle juice); giant crispy pork skin, octopus croquette with bonito; kampachi ceviche; pineapple with mole, passionfruit, black mint.']"
87,"['Chef Sirichai Sreparplarn serves Thai fare that few other NYC restaurants offer', 'Step into Ugly Baby and the bright colors explode: reds, oranges, yellows, and blues sponged on the walls, sometimes resembling clouds and mountains. The narrow room seats 25 at small tables and five along a counter that borders the open kitchen. The origin of the name? In Thailand new parents hesitate to praise a baby to keep evil spirits away. Calling a baby ugly almost guarantees good fortune, or in this case, good food.', 'Ugly Baby was born with impressive lineage. This Carroll Gardens newcomer was preceded by two now-defunct Red Hook establishments, Kao Soy and a pop-up called Chiang Mai, both known for their advocacy of Northern Thai fare and adventuresome dishes from other regions. Ugly Baby’s chef, Sirichai Sreparplarn, worked both places. He thankfully forgoes the annoying practice, common in New York’s Thai cafes, of providing a catalog of protein choices for each dish.', 'Sreparplarn parses his menu from the cuisine of Bangkok and the four regions of Thailand, with dishes selected for their novelty and powerful spice combinations, rather than for their familiarity to New York diners. The chef wants to surprise us with the breathtaking range of Siamese cuisine. Don’t expect pad Thai, but if you want to blowtorch your mouth, Ugly Baby provides ample opportunity. ', 'Gai golae (chicken thigh skewers), kang ho (pork shoulder with red curry paste), and pla tod kamin (yellow sea bream)', 'The 20-item menu more fully explores southern Thai cooking than any previous establishment in the city — dishes originating along the Malay Peninsula, which dangles from the main land mass of the country. This isthmus of beaches, islands, and mountains has a cuisine influenced by Indonesian and Malaysian food. Witness gai golae ($10), a pair of chunky chicken brochettes thickly coated with coconut curry and grilled, like satays without the dipping sauce. They’re supremely wonderful. ', 'Southern cooking is sometimes said to be spicier than Isan, and spiciest of all at Ugly Baby is kua kling ($20). The menu carries the stern warning “brutally spicy” for this dry curry of coarsely ground beef and fresh red chiles. It comes decorated with green peppercorns and shredded kaffir lime leaves, dry and crinkled like nori. Though suffused with a perfumy flavor, the heat begins rising with the first bite and never lets up.', 'Predictably, Southern Thai cooking is seafood-heavy, and the restaurant confirms it with tom kati sai bua ($25), a coconut soup of steamed mackerel and lotus stems, and pla tod kamin, a mellow yellow sea bream rubbed with turmeric and garlic. Not all seafood recipes on Ugly Baby’s menu come from the South. Attributed to Central Thailand, tom som pla kra pong proves a tart tamarind stew of red snapper filets, heaped up in the middle of the bowl like a tropical atoll.', 'The menu hits you with something fantastic — or at least something interesting — at every turn. In the “interesting” category find teen ped prik tai dum, a heap of whitish duck feet in black pepper sauce. Duck feet are more like crunchy pig ears than chicken feet, but the monovalent flavor of the dish makes a nice contrast to the spicy onslaught of the others. Also providing relief are tue ka ko ($9), a quintet of small coconut-milk muffins embedded with black beans. You’ll wish you had some for breakfast.', 'Representing for Isan is a fine duck larb with toasted rice powder sprinkled on top. On one try it was fine, but on another, it was way too hot, even for my chile-loving guests. On that occasion we gratefully followed it with the mildly spiced Bangkok beef soup, which featured fatty chunks of brisket in a dark sweet broth. It might have been at home in a Jewish deli.', 'There are other charmingly plainish things, too, including a massive heap of bean sprouts with minced pork and tofu. The dish, called pad tua ngok rau kao ($14), seems like something you’d enthusiastically eat for dinner at home some night when you just wanted something simple.', 'We’ve come to the part of the review where I tell you the best thing I ate at Ugly Baby. Hung le is a Chiang Mai classic, a sweet stew of pork shoulder in red curry paste. The chef tosses it with mung bean noodles, herbs, and greens, sides it with pig skin and sticky rice, and calls it kang hoh ($17). Like an ugly infant, it’s not much to look at, but it provides a kaleidoscope of flavors, probably unlike anything you’ve tasted in a Thai restaurant before.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including four dishes, plus tax but not tip, $80.', 'Sample Dishes: gai golae (chicken satays), pla tod kamin (turmeric sea bream), kua kling (spicy beef curry), laab ped udon (duck salad)', 'What to Drink: Ugly Baby is currently BYOB, so bring beer, a dry or off-dry white wine, or a fizzy red such as a Lambrusco.']"
88,"['A chain from India knocks Punjabi dishes like butter chicken out of the park', 'For many of us, the first Indian cuisine we fell in love with came from Punjab: lamb and chicken in thick gravies pungent with ginger, garlic, and masalas, flaunting powerful flavors that put European gravies to shame. And those meaty curries were matched with meatless ones that taught Americans new ways to look at vegetables like spinach, potatoes, and cauliflower. But as the present century dawned, other regional Indian cuisines from places like Kerala, Hyderabad, and Gujarat came to supplant — or at least rival — it in our affections. Now, the Punjabi menu has returned at Chawla’s 2 in enhanced form, and the time has come to give it another try.', 'The Punjab is a region that sprawls across India’s northern frontier into Pakistan. It lies along the Silk Road, which has historically provided ready access to spices that are often used by the handful. The Sikh religious group’s center and principal temple is there in Amritsar, a city that’s name-checked several times on the menu. Amritsari kulcha ($3.49) is one example — an herb-flecked, potato-stuffed flatbread brushed with oil. It could become your favorite Indian bread.', 'Chawla’s 2 represents a restaurant chain with 110 branches in Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, as well as northern India. It was founded in a town northeast of New Delhi in 1960 by S. Attar Singh Chawla. The “2” in the moniker signifies a modern approach to cooking, featuring locally sourced ingredients and a menu emphasizing tandoori cooking and adding other fare like Indo-Chinese. Located just southeast of Gramercy Park, the restaurant is well lit and boxy, decorated with playful cartoons of colorfully turbaned Sikhs juggling veggies and spinning flatbreads in the air.', 'Complete meals for one person are a real bargain, mainly in the $10.99 to $13.99 range and including a main dish, dal, and roti or rice. Larger entrees accompanied with rice are paradoxically $3 less, so it’s better to marshal a group of friends and share several. Then you can also explore the appetizers, which are hidden away in the sections called “Sides” and “From the Fryer.”', 'Appetizer gobi Manchurian ($10.99) comes from the Indo-Chinese canon, battered and deep-fried cauliflower smothered in a tangy sauce. Most places it’s greasy and syrupy, but here the dish is relatively light. With similar flavors, lollipop chicken deploys wings with the flesh pushed to the end of the bone, making them look like Chupa Chups. For vegetarians, chilly paneer and chilly mushroom — using a common Indian spelling of “chili” — are good choices. A particularly filling starter is keema naan, a naan stuffed with ground meat that comes with a bucket of mild gravy.', 'But let’s cut to the chase, entrée-wise. One of the best features of the restaurant is the use of cream rather than milk in its recipes. Cream chicken ($8.99) is the menu’s flagship: boneless bird in a buff-colored sauce lacking the expected masalas. It tastes herbal and almost French. One of the herbs is certainly fenugreek, and the recipe, formulated by the chain’s founder, is further enriched with crushed cashews.', 'This dish seems like a challenge to the more commonly seen butter chicken, a Punjabi crowd pleaser featuring poultry pieces in a pink tomato sauce. Some fellow diners and I decided to compare cream chicken to butter chicken one evening, and I was the only one who preferred the cream chicken. “The butter chicken is a little bit sweeter and more richly flavored,” one friend observed. I recommend trying them both side by side, and rendering your own opinion, since they’re two of the most delectable things on the menu.', 'The northern vegetarian Indian standards are all available in above average renditions, including malai kofta (vegetarian “meatballs” in a thick sauce), palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese cubes), and mushroom tikka. But the best vegetarian choice here is kukuri bhindi ($6.99) — shredded okra fried until the green vegetable achieves the consistency of fruit leather. Jumbled with raw yellow and red bell peppers and purple onions, the dish is an explosion of colors and textures. And for those who detest the usual sliminess of okra — this method of cooking banishes it.', 'In line with the fresh and natural aesthetic of the restaurant, the tandoori chicken is not colored red with artificial dyes. Instead, it is coated with a beige spice paste before roasting in the oven. While wholesome tasting, it doesn’t pack the smoky wham of the usual recipe, so skip it. One dish I found particularly interesting was something I’d never encountered before: rara mutton. Pieces of tender lamb swim in a sauce laced with lots of ground chicken. Ground chicken? Well, for folks who always order the meat lover’s pie in a pizzeria, consider this a great choice.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one app, entrees, one bread, two beers, plus tax but not tip is $50.', 'Sample dishes: Keema naan with gravy, cream chicken, gobi Manchurian, Chawla’s special biryani\xa0 ', 'What to drink: Kingfisher or Taj Mahal Indian beer are good choices, but skip the wines available. The restaurant’s “fresh lime soda” ($3.99) is wonderful, filled with unexpected flavors.']"
89,"['Sizzling kebabs and molten khachapuri await in Bay Ridge', 'Of all the cuisines of the former Soviet republics, Georgian is the most delicious. It makes much of fresh herbs, turning soups and stews bright green. As with other countries along the Silk Road, kebabs are cooked over charcoal to be way fatty and smoky. Composed salads constitute another strong point, with walnuts and pomegranates making frequent appearances. And for those who love dumplings, Georgian examples are fist-sized, while the country’s breads are rapidly becoming New York classics.', 'Open one year, Georgian Dream is the city’s best restaurant from the mountainous republic that straddles Europe and Asia. It lacks the object-cluttered walls and paintings by late 19th-century artist Pirosmani — showing dudes with massive mustaches — that characterize many other Georgian restaurants. Instead, sitting at a table is like being in the square of a serene village. Up above hang street lights and balconies, whose doors seemingly might swing open at any moment as people wander out to admire the Bay Ridge sunset.', 'The breads mentioned earlier include khachapuris, and the menu offers three contrasting examples from the regional cuisines of Georgia. The one most New Yorkers will be familiar with is khachapuri acharuli ($15), which resembles a bulbous canoe filled with molten cheese. On top of the cheese, threatening to swamp the canoe, are a raw egg yolk and a knob of liquefying butter. Stir the ingredients before pulling off hunks of bread to dip in the delectable mess.', 'For those uninterested in a jiggling raw yolk in a slippery pool of butter, cardiologically-speaking, the khachapuri megruli ($12) might be the ticket instead. Shaped like a pizza, the bread is covered with a double layer of sulguni cheese. In fact, it’s what might be called a white pizza, only the cheese has been browned to make it chewier and more pungent. Imeruli khachapuri features two layers of dough with the cheese inside. Back in Georgia, there are at least five other variations, some featuring boiled eggs and potatoes.', 'You won’t find better charcoal-grilled kebabs than at Georgian Dream. The population of the country is largely Christian, rather than Muslim or Jewish, so it offers pork kebabs ($12) not available in Uzbek or Turkish establishments. These are made with fatty ground meat and come dusted with sumac. They’re also wrapped in a flatbread, so you can eat them like cylindrical sandwiches. Rice or french fries are served alongside. Pick the fab fries, which are creamy on the inside, and a perfect sienna brown on the outside.', 'Among other easy-to-love treats are the huge, thick-skinned dumplings. Like Tibetan momos or Shanghai soup dumplings, these khinkali ($12 for six) are round and puckered on top like a leather coin purse. They feature a mixture of ground meats seasoned with onions and garlic. When cut into, juice often spurts out.', 'As if this were the American Georgia, corn has made its way onto the menu in a big way in the form of gomi. This honest bowl of fluffy cornmeal porridge might be mistaken for hominy grits, and to further extend the illusion, the bowl is topped with butter and cheese. Don’t miss it. Georgian is also a cuisine loaded with stews. My favorite is chakapuli, a veal casserole with a bright green broth due to fresh tarragon — which also confers a liquorice-y flavor you might love or hate. ', 'Probably the most famous Georgian entree is chicken tabaka, which a friend has facetiously called “road-kill chicken.” It consists of a partly deboned bird that gets flattened, fried, and then paved with crushed garlic; it has long been a staple of Russian and other former Soviet restaurants. Unfortunately, the version at Georgian Dream is pallid, and delivers no garlic wallop, so skip it. Instead, turn to the vegetarian dishes that pack the menu.', 'The regular tossed salads are pristine in their freshness and generously dressed, mainly featuring lettuce and tomatoes, and the pickle platter will remind you that, in a geographically confused way, Georgia is on the fringes of Eastern Europe, even though it’s east of Turkey. And so does olivie, which is a lot like American potato salad with a few extra veggies thrown in. But why not turn to the composed salads, which are more uniquely Georgian?', 'Indeed, the “assorted pkhali” ($16) might be the best thing on the menu — it’s certainly the most beautiful. Three compressed pucks of vegetable matter are aligned on the all-white platter: one pink, one yellow, one as green as a forest in springtime, all scattered with pomegranate seeds and fresh herbs. Green beans, beets, and spinach are the vegetables providing the colors, stuck together with a walnut, garlic, and herb puree. And you won’t find a more delectable vegan dish in Brooklyn.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one salad, one cheese bread, a kebab with fries, and a stew, plus tax but not tip, $60.', 'Sample dishes: assorted pkhali (three composed salads), khinkali (dumplings), chakapuli (veal casserole), pork kebabs ', 'What to drink: Georgian dream is BYOB, so bring beer or wine.

Over 20 years later, Reichl’s quote again rings true for The Lobster Club, Major Food Group’s absurdly derivative theme park of celebrity-, teriyaki-, and wasabi-laced revelry.', 'The $10 million restaurant, a reboot of the old Brasserie in the landmark Seagram Building, could pass itself off as a Starburst-colored set piece from Charlie’s Angels: Full Throttle. ', 'A woman’s gold wrap dress mirrors bronze panels adorning the walls. A couple smooches on a sea-green couch, while an uneaten volcano of pink shaved ice sits untouched at a nearby table; the dessert matches perfectly with the pink, Eero Saarinen-esque chairs. Servers in paint-splotched pants walk across a floor that mimics a Jackson Pollock canvas.', 'Shelves are lined with Picasso plates; a back room is filled with Picasso-inspired sculptures; and floating booths are decorated with interpretive collages of Richard Prince’s Picasso nudes. Peter Marino (Louis Vuitton Soho, Dior London) is the big-deal designer, and for those who aren’t familiar, there’s a prominent photograph of him, in his classic leather biker gear, near the restrooms. ', 'Everyone sips at lychee-tinis, yuzu sake-tinis, and melon mojitos at the three-deep bar. The crowd freezes as Martha Stewart marches out with her entourage.', 'Taken all in from the entrance balcony, the Lobster Club is a ball of pure, super-saturated, hyperchromatic energy, a departure from the solemn sushi or kaiseki temples that have been popping up around town. Head chef Tasuku Murakami used to work at Azabu, one of those Michelin-starred temples. And now he’s here at The Lobster Club, whipping up spicy toro rolls completely devoid of tuna belly’s signature silky texture. Those rolls wouldn’t be so infuriating if they were served at a cheap takeout spot in Penn Station, not here, as a $27 snack. It’s some of the city’s most disappointing high-end sushi. ', 'It’s been nearly a year since the restaurateurs/showmen behind Major Food took over culinary operations at the Seagram building, the site of the old Four Seasons complex. The first space to open was The Grill, a Kennedy-era chophouse that tips its hat to the postwar optimism of the ’50s and ’60s. The second was The Pool, which fast-forwarded to the present as a modern American ode to the world’s oceans — and a fancy contender to Le Bernardin.', 'The Lobster Club falls somewhere in between, celebrating the chic Japanese and pan-Asian brasseries of the 1990s and early aughts. Sometimes this means channeling Nobu, with a sweet, $36 pile of crab sitting in a fragrant pool of vinegar and cilantro. Sometimes this means leaning in the direction of China and Indonesia, as with wok-fried lobster tail, the crustacean’s meat glossed with a lip-tingling layer of sambal. Sometimes this means referencing a curry-ya through chicken wings covered in a explosive dry rub of turmeric, cayenne, allspice, cloves, and piri piri.', 'And sometimes this means paying tribute to cheap karaoke joints with sake bombs or to post-war Tiki spots (and Red Lobster) with coconut shrimp.', 'Generally speaking, there are four ingredients to Major Food’s special sauce. The first is an electric sense of theatricality, from the swaying palm fronds of Santina to the exuberant tableside flambes of The Grill. The second is high-profile art or design collaborations with the likes of Renzo Piano, Vito Schnabel, and Merino. The third ingredient is a smart dose of Quentin Tarantino, which is to say mining the B-level dregs of popular culture and turning the undervalued and underappreciated into award-winning gold. A fine example is the Michelin-starred Carbone making haute analogues to comfort classics like rigatoni alla vodka or veal parm. ', 'That $67 parm, incidentally, brings us to the fourth and final part of the equation: Major Food knows how to charge an insane amount of money for what is usually pretty great food. ', 'Dinner at The Lobster Club will easily run about $150 per person. The owners know that good ingredients, peppered with a touch of nostalgia and a bit of creativity, can command a markup. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Whether it’s Christina Tosi refining cereal milk or Wylie Dufresne rethinking Combos, modern gastronomy can remind us why we loved a dish from long ago and impart cultural cachet. This explains why The Lobster Club’s sake bomb and coconut shrimp are actually two of the most thrilling dishes here. ', 'The bartender instructs you to drop a shot of yuzu sake, the color of limoncello, into a glass of yuzu-laced lager; the result isn’t so much a drunken 4 a.m. mistake as a balanced beverage with brilliant notes of sugar and concentrated citrus. The fried rock shrimp, in turn, collapse in the mouth with just a flick of the tongue, the coconut gently sweetening the natural oceanic sugars. Even the tired dish known as teriyaki is a magical blend of sugar and soy, taming the vibrant oils of medium-rare king salmon. ', 'If only the rest of Lobster Club truly felt as if it were trying to improve upon the diverse traditions of New York’s Japanese-leaning spots. ', 'Sansho octopus, packing an impressively crispy sear, boasts none of the namesake peppercorn’s signature numbing — a sensation that’s generally accessible at any good yakitori spot. Tuna with rice crispies, bland and underseasoned, pales in comparison to a Perry St. version. Raw beef with uni, a dish that first wowed me a decade ago at Takashi, is somehow less thrilling here at $37 for a few tiny bites. ', 'Teppanyaki, the entry point into Japanese cuisine for so many suburban Americans, comes across as less compelling when the performative, Benihana-style griddle is hidden in the kitchen — and when it produces half a chicken whose skin is as floppy as bologna. Better is the concentrated study in beef fat that is wagyu skirt steak.', 'And finally, there is the sushi. A $68 chef’s platter arrives with unseasoned fish, and rice that ranges from firm to barely warm to chilly to gummy. On another night, the rice is well textured, but entirely cold. Palate-perking wasabi is sometimes absent, and sometimes used in nuclear proportions. The grains exhibit little vinegar to balance the fattiness of (very good) deepwater snapper. Murakami’s sushi is simply raw fish over rice. It is distinctive only in its mediocrity.', 'The highlight of any meal at The Lobster Club occurs near the end, when a waiter ferries over a foot-high cone of shaved ice ($15), half of it laced with cream, the other half with blood orange. This kakigori is essentially a giant Creamsicle, with a level of complexity that far surpasses the classic frozen treat. Some bites are bitter from the citrus, others silky from the dairy, and still others refreshingly watery. And a bit a pleasant cognitive dissonance ensues when the sturdy-looking structure yields an airy-as-cotton-candy mouthfeel.', 'One could speak as highly of the yuzu meringue tart, intensely sugary at first, with a sneaky acidity that builds as the dessert is consumed. And surely there are no other green-tea puffs with such a tightrope balance of tannic matcha and palate-softening cream.', 'The shame, of course, is that while The Lobster Club’s website praises the work of both Murakami and Marino (as well as the head bartender), the name of the pastry chef, Stephanie Prida, is omitted. She’s nowhere to be found on The Pool’s or The Grill’s websites either, where she oversees the four-star sweets; the same can be said of the latter restaurant’s chef de cuisine, Ashley Rath.', 'For a hospitality group that understands the story of a restaurant begins outside the restaurant — just as the hopes and expectations of a potential moviegoer are set by the trailer — it’s hard to fathom why such talented folks are left out of the credits.

92,"['Thrilling small plates from northwest Spain shine here', 'Starting in the 1930s, Manhattan had lots of tapas bars in Greenwich Village and Chelsea, serving small portions of flaming chorizo and grilled octopus. But beginning in the early years of this century, tapas bars underwent a spectacular revival, with the newcomers introducing creative dishes at least partly inspired by the new Spanish cooking of Ferran Adria and his disciples, like Boqueria and Tertulia. Now a new place has opened up that proves tapas fever hasn’t abated yet.', 'Tomiño Taberna Gallega — located in Little Italy on Grand Street — specializes in tapas from Galicia, a rugged land on Spain’s northwest coast. There, bagpipes are still played, and the empanada was invented. The consulting chef is Lucia Freitas, whose restaurant in Santiago de Compostela, A Tafona Casa de Xantar, remains one of Galicia’s most notable. ', 'Located on Grand between Mott and Mulberry on the fringes of Chinatown and Little Italy, Tomiño provides an oasis of light late into the evening. The front half of the restaurant is a wood-accented barroom, with big doors that open onto the street, and a long bar with a fresh seafood case at one end. From that case fly langostinos a la plancha ($17), three jumbo prawns cooked on a griddle — head, antennae, beady eyes, and all. Crunch at their buttery perfection.', 'Opposite are a pair of booths, which provide the most lively and comfortable seating. Overhead a printed curtain ripples, upon which a mural of gleaners wading into the surf to pull percebes (gooseneck barnacles) from the rocks is depicted, though unfortunately, the restaurant hasn’t offered them. Up a few steps, the rear dining room is more prosaic, with functional furniture, Spanish pottery in niches, and an open kitchen at the end. Both rooms feel very European.', 'It is in that back room that you should chow down on any of the more substantial meals known as Platos Principales. Bacalao con coliflor ($28) is the most interesting, a sizzling plate of fresh cod with potatoes and cauliflower swamped with béchamel, like a white wave breaking over rocks. Also good is macarron de la abuela, a grandmotherly dish of penne, chicken, and forest mushrooms that one-ups chicken cacciatore. Skip the risotto-like arroz caldosto ($48, for two), which is altogether too salty, sloppy, and soupy to merit the exemplary seafood washing around therein.', 'But really, this is not a place for a formal sit-down meal, since most of the excitement is in the four other menu sections, which concentrate on small plates, several demonstrating the quirky and unique cuisine of Galicia. Check out the tortilla de Betanzos ($10), named after a small town that was known as Carunium in Roman times. It looks like a round bouncy cushion upon which a jewel might be displayed, but when cut open, a liquid center of potatoes and egg yolk spills out. No more dry tortilla.', 'Huevos rotos con zorza turns out to be a wonderful hash of pork loin, eggs, and crisp potatoes; I could eat this every day for breakfast. Foremost of all dishes that are more rare in New York is Tomiño’s take on the empanada. The restaurant offers the version most New Yorkers are familiar with, a folded and crimped pocket pie carried by Spanish mariners all over the world. But the original empanada was more of a communal pastry, a giant pie cut into pieces. Tomiño stuffs this giant pie with salt cod or chorizo and chicken, and serves it in four small rectangular pieces per order ($12).', 'Yes, Tomiño also offers the greatest hits of tapas bars, including tiny, finger-size chorizos set aflame in a cast iron pan; gooey octopus dusted with paprika and stuck on toothpicks; and callos, a righteous stew of tripe, sausage, and chickpeas. The mellow delights of Spain, which would be displayed right on the bar if it weren’t for NYC’s paranoid Health Department, are best experienced in the tapas combo called “mixta” ($17), which includes a wedge of tortilla, slices of serrano ham, pan con tomate (bread rubbed with tomatoes), and bowl of mixed olives.', 'The food menu is bolstered by a powerful drinks program that allows a choice between Galician beer and Spanish cider on tap, expertly made gin and tonics featuring such flavors as raspberry and ginger, and vermouth, which is in many ways the signature beverage of Spain. At Tomiño, the list runs to nine varieties in shades of red and white, served traditionally in a tumbler with ice and an orange slice ($7 to $9). You won’t find a more refreshing beverage for sipping, nor one that goes better with a wedge of tortilla or pair of grilled sardines.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including four tapas, a shared main course, and two glasses of vermouth, plus tax but not tip, $100', 'Sample dishes: Tortilla de Betanzos (with liquid center), empanada de Gallega del dia, huevos rotos con zorza (pork loin hash), and bacalao con coliflor\xa0 ', 'What to drink: Spanish draft cider, lemon gin and tonic, Orujo grappa, vermouth, Estrella Galicia beer on tap']"

Here in East Williamsburg, Win Son reinterprets the classic by placing a butter-grilled shrimp patty between two halves of a grease-slicked miantuan bun.', 'The kitchen tops the patty with pickled pineapple. The result is a masterful creation whose marked sugars, fruity acidity, and squishy bread lean toward the pastry world, but whose oceanic aromas keep it planted in the savory world. All it needs is a spoon of chile oil (on every table) and a cooling chiña colada cocktail, a verdant mix of rum, cilantro, basil, and coconut. The creamy drink cleanses the palate of any lingering salts — and amps up the sweetness just one or two more notches. ', 'Win Son is where you should be eating now. The Kickstarter-funded restaurant opened in May 2016, thanks to the efforts of Josh Ku, a former property manager from Queens, and Trigg Brown, a chef who worked at Upland and Craft. The duo met at a barbecue in Bed-Stuy; bonded over Taiwan’s creative, protean food culture; traveled to Tainan City for research; and eventually settled on the corner of Montrose and Graham.', 'The basic rectangle of a space was, and still is, bare bones: creaky wood floors, exposed brick walls, black chairs, blonde wood tables, and a concrete bar. The soundtrack is hip-hop. The only kitsch is a trio of recycled soda-bottle chandeliers that gently glow red; the only artwork is a mural of folks eating at a communal table, a modern penal device that Win Son thankfully lacks. ', 'Win Son is just an unassuming neighborhood spot that happens to serve some of the city’s most ambitious Taiwanese fare. ', 'Table waits can easily hit two hours, the product of a booking system that only takes reservations for five or more. The smart move is to snag a few seats at the bar and order an omelet. Soft eggs are folded around mild Beausoleil oysters and a thick layer of sweet-potato starch, a traditional addition that adds stretchiness the way packaged shredded cheese would in an American diner omelet. The correct match for all the muted, silky flavors is the Breakfast of Champions, a restrained blend of rum, peanut milk, black sesame, and toasted coconut shavings. It is a cocktail, yes, but it also recalls the globally popular milk teas (sometimes studded with tapioca balls) for which Taiwan is famous.', 'Any cuisine in a globalizing world can be difficult to define; what makes the food of Taiwan so fascinatingly complex is that the island nation has seen its diverse gastronomy fueled by a long history of immigration. It derives many of its influences from China’s neighboring Fujian and Guangzhou provinces, but it also incorporates foods from the Japanese occupation in the 20th century, the Hakka diaspora, indigenous peoples, and an influx of refugees from all corners of China following the civil war that ended in 1950.', 'One of Taiwan’s modern classics, spicy popcorn chicken, became popular in the late 1970s as an easier-to-eat analog to the bone-in variety, hawked by local KFC outposts. Win Son’s riff on that dish is spectacular. Brown coats dark-meat nuggets in a cayenne-laced sweet-potato starch, fries them to a dense crunch, and drenches the morsels in a butter-spiked persimmon hot sauce. The chicken bursts with a distinct poultry tang, offset by shards of crispy fried basil. Wendy’s stock price would go through the roof if the chain figured out a way to take these nationwide.', 'Taiwanese fare, of course, is not new to New Yorkers, but what makes Win Son particularly compelling in 2018 is that it’s benefiting from a resurgent interest in the Asian nation’s cuisine, fueled by a new crop of young culinarians riffing on their ancestral fare. Eddie Huang was an early entrant with his Baohaus, slinging soft pork buns in Lower Manhattan. More recent additions include Zai Lai in Turnstyle Underground Market, where commuters pay $14 for pork rice bowls, and Ho Foods in the East Village, where prospective diners endure properly long lines for beef noodle soup. ', 'Following is a list of what to order at Win Son, with just one suggested skip.', 'Stinky tofu: The traditional night market snack, made odiferous via a long fermentation. The aroma makes even the longest dry-aged steaks seem as mild as chicken breast. Dip in sweet soy chile sauce to dial down the durian-esque pungency.', 'Marinated cucumbers with bottarga: Unlike the tart Sichuan variety, Win Son’s version, laced with a heap of cured mullet roe, is pure umami bliss. The not-too-salty cukes pack the round mouthfeel of MSG-laced bouillon.', 'Sloppy bao: Soft steamed buns filled with a sweet-savory-spicy mix of peanuts, ground pork, and chiles.', 'Fried eggplant: Batons of the nightshade fried in such an airy way that they almost taste closer to the yeasty fried dough called youtiao than a proper vegetable (on a good night; they sometimes turn a touch soggy). Dip in a tangy black vinegar sauce, then drag it through a swath of kefir cheese, and repeat.', 'Clams and basil: Cockles steamed in a sauce of Shaoxing white wine, garlic, brown butter, and basil. It’s a straightforward mix of brine and diary, with a proper heap of scallion pancakes for sauce sopping.', 'BK egg bomb: A riff on a pan-Taiwanese dish, a scallion pancake coated in egg and fried. The Win Son twist is using the bread to hide a layer of chopped raw steak — fatty wagyu doused in lime juice, sesame oil, and doubanjiang, a Sichuan chili bean sauce.', 'Fly’s head: The classic dish of ground pork tossed with incendiary Thai chile, chopped garlic chives, and fermented black beans (which are meant to evoke the namesake insect). The meaty salad exudes a distinct funk from the beans, and is best enjoyed over a small plate of rice to catch all the meaty drippings.', 'Danzi noodles: Firm ramen-like noodles in a dark, spicy broth of ham, chicken, shellfish, and chiles. A single head-on shrimp lies on top.', 'Beef rolls: A brilliantly drippy mess of star anise- and cinnamon-braised beef shank, wrapped in thin scallion pancakes and cut to the length of mini egg rolls. The bread is essential here because it tames the rampant salts, sweet aromas, and powerful bovine punch of the braise.', 'Big chicken sandwich: Crispy, underseasoned dark meat on a tiger bun with fermented tofu mayo and cilantro. Despite a custom YouTube video advertising the offering, it’s just an acceptably average, uninspiring entry into the city’s crowded field of fried chicken sandwiches. Skip it. ', 'Lu rou fan: Caramel soy-braised pork belly, a traditional dish where saucy, smoky swine enriches the rice grains underneath. The pork, enlivened by chile oil and tamed by the acid of pickled greens, is a one-plate meal for $15.', 'Zha jiang mian: A slow braise of lamb, fortified with Beijing-style yellow bean paste, and softened with cucumbers. This is all tossed with fettuccine-like noodles — and more lamb fat — turning it into what’s essentially one of the city’s best and funkiest bologneses.', 'Ice Cream Sando: The sweeter analog to the “nutritious sandwich.” It’s made with the same fried mian tuan roll as the shrimp version, but is filled with vanilla ice cream and showered in fragrant cilantro and peanuts. The dairy melts fast under the warmth of the soft pastry, making this a sloppy knife-and-fork affair.', 'So there you go: Win Son gives you doughnuts for dinner, and doughnuts for dessert. Pretty close to perfect, right?', 'Cost: All but one dish is priced at $19 or less; sandwiches are $14; dessert is $9.', 'Sample dishes: Marinated cucumbers with garlic and cilantro, sloppy bao stew pork buns,  BK egg bomb with wagyu tartare, fried eggplant with kefir cheese, clams and basil, lu rou fan, nutritious “shrimp cake” sandwich, danzi noodles with shrimp.', 'Bonus tip: To avoid a table wait, make a resy for a party of 5 or more, or come super early, right when the venue opens.', 'Sign up for our newsletter.']"
94,"['Robert Sietsema awards three stars to the Gowanus newcomer', 'For a few weeks at the end of last summer, there was no better place to be in Brooklyn than Claro. In the shadow of vine-covered trellises, with a light breeze blowing off the Gowanus and cicadas humming in the trees, tables and a blue-tiled bar beckoned in the sunken backyard of what was formerly The Pines. Hunkered next to the restaurant was a wood-fired oven, where meats were grilled and flatbreads cooked on a griddle, everything emerging infused with the heady odor of smoke. To sit and enjoy a cocktail as your dinner was prepared in plain view was to experience the highest form of culinary expectation. ', 'And so a table of friends and I relaxed in the early evening just as the sun was setting and enjoyed a soupy shrimp ceviche known as an aguachile, a vinegary rabbit salpicon, and a mole amarillo of chicken with green romano beans in a lovely orange sauce. One of the virtues of Claro, run by chef TJ Steele, is its concentration on the food of Oaxaca, a brilliant cuisine from southern Mexico rarely seen in New York City.', 'The highlight of my first meal at Claro, and one enjoyed in memory days later, was the pork rib memela ($16), a hand-patted flatbread topped with shredded meat and white cheese, with just enough chile de arbol to give it zing and acidity. The outdoor kitchen — and the way it imbues smoke into dishes — certainly is an asset.', 'But on my following visits, some wood-fire cooked items weren’t available, though the owners say the outdoor kitchen is functional year-round. The menu had shifted around considerably. Could Claro make up for its wood oven deficit? The short answer is yes. Replacements included a heart-warming chicken consommé with masa dumplings and shredded kale that did a convincing imitation of matzo ball soup, and a chile relleno stuffed with chorizo and potato sprawled in an earthy tomato sauce. The memela menu had been expanded, and so had the range of raw fish dishes and the selection of moles, too.', 'Let’s look at the moles first. These represent the cooking of indigenous nations that resided in Oaxaca before Cortes arrived in the early 16th century, painstaking sauces often containing chiles, nuts, herbs, spices, and even chocolate. In fact, the most famous of these, attributed to the state of Puebla just north of Oaxaca, is often called simply “mole.” Legendarily, Oaxaca has seven moles, identified by color and each having its own special uses. These are so difficult to make that many restaurants don’t bother.', 'Not so at Claro. Its menu includes mole negro ($32), a thick, midnight-black sauce with just a trace of sweetness that one-ups Pueblan mole by toasting the spices first. Claro puts a duck leg in it, sprinkles sesame seeds on top, and sides it with a rotating roster of vegetables, which on my visit included delicata squash and brussels sprouts. The sprouts didn’t really belong, but who demands absolute authenticity? The other mole currently on the menu is a mole rojo (red mole) with pork cheeks. Please, Claro, more moles! ', 'In its post-summer menus, the restaurant has gone wild with tostadas. These crisp toasted tortilla platforms are often used in Mexico as staging areas for ceviches. Claro’s yellowfin tuna tostada ($22) is perfect in every way, pink nuggets of fish mixed with blood orange and crunchy chicharron, and so is an octopus tostada with pickled chiles and tocino, a crispy pork belly. The biggest dud on a menu that contains few is a tostada smeared with a ground Wagyu beef tartare, seasoned with the kind of gusano (worm) salt more often used on the rim of a margarita. I say bring on the insect larvae — but not in this usage.', 'Claro is one place where you shouldn’t ignore the desserts, even though only three are offered. Best is dulce de calabaza ($12), a wedge of well-roasted pumpkin flooded with caramel sauce and sided with thick whipped cream. There is no earthier dessert in town, and it powerfully recalls the ancient origins of Mexican gastronomy. And the restaurant will surely warrant a revisit for more wood oven fare.

And that was my favorite thing about International Smoke (apart from the word “HUMAN” being stenciled on every bathroom door): its globetrotting, multicultural focus, its borders so blissfully wide-open I wouldn’t put it past Trump to swoop in at any minute and order them closed. I only wish International Smoke lived up to its promise. ', 'Curry smartly conceived of a restaurant that mirrors her own Jamaican-Chinese-Polish-African-American background. Although she intended Smoke to be a mash-up of true international flavors, it played more like a muted, Epcot imitation fit more for an Anywhere USA mall than a sophisticated food city. Something along the way — from Ayesha’s home to the Mina Group LLC headquarters to the Millennium Tower — must have been lost in translation. ', 'The place certainly had its pros: the frothy, coconut-milky, crushed-ice Horquito rum cocktail and the crisp fennel-radish-carrot crudite; the buttery-sweet curried cornbread and the garlic-chile hominy that should be bagged and offered to road-trippers as a substitute for corn nuts. The roasted, soy-caramel-glazed Brussels sprouts tasted like sticky-sweet bundles of joy. And the Thai shrimp tom kha was rich and spicy and better than any I’ve had from my go-to take-outs. Then again, if I’d been in the mood for red curry with shrimp, I would have stayed home and ordered it. This one, though, came flanked by an atypical garnish: more of that cornbread. ', 'Otherwise, upon reading the menu, I wanted absolutely everything! Upon eating it… we were underwhelmed by almost everything. The Kalua “Instant Bacon” with Hawaiian teriyaki, cilantro, and pineapple salsa on a steamed bun was all bun, barely any bacon. I love a soft pillow, but its folded doughy-white puffs were so smothering they muffled any flavor. The green papaya slaw lacked so much, including kick, I thought perhaps the kitchen had accidentally shredded the fruit and then forgot about it. The smoked burrata came with a big show (a glass dish lifted in a magic puff of smoke) and a befuddling cold mush of shaved Brussels, spiced squash, apples, and pecans. The black garlic and miso cod was as salty as the sea, and the Vietnamese barbecue pork chop was striped with aesthetically pleasing charred marks, but tasted more like a quick flame-broil job than barbecue through and through. ', 'Smoked burrata with spiced squash, Brussels sprouts, apple, pecan', 'Smoked pork — in various forms — was the supposed centerpiece of the lengthy menu, yet I’d take the simple charcoal-grilled, lime-tinged Maine lobster tail (for a ridiculous $58) over them all. The Korean scallion crepes were flaccid and forgettable; the sliders ranked low among all the sliders I’ve enjoyed in my life. Only the crunch of the tostadas topped with smoky-hot New Mexican adovada-style pork shoulder sated. And the smoked ribs, trimmed to an easy-to-eat St. Louis style, came coated in a too-mild Korean gochujang, spicy New Mexican adovada, or sweet, sticky American barbecue. Touched with caramelized sugar then blow-torched, the American barbecues were the best. The meat fell off the bone, but without more bark, more finger-sucking, soul-stirring depth, the ribs failed to make me fall in love.  ', 'I wanted to at least like our servers. As people they were fine, but as humans working in the hospitality industry, they lacked an understanding of their jobs. Instead of offering eye contact, a semblance of personality, and an ability to offer much more than poorly memorized descriptions of the $30, $40, $50 entrees, they seemed sort of miserable, mechanical, hoping to just get through their night rather than help us enjoy ours.

Originating in Yunnan, mixian is a type of rice noodle that’s strikingly white and slender like spaghetti. Try to pick them up with chopsticks and they may fall away before reaching your mouth, since the noodles are mega-slippery. ', 'Served as communal hot pots, the most famous mixian order is called crossing the bridge noodles, named for the story featuring a grumpy scholar on an island, a bridge, and an inventive spouse who looks for a way to get his noodles to him hot. Hint: it involves an early version of tableside preparation.', 'At Deng Ji, look for noodles in the Guo Qiao (“bridge”) section of the menu. One selection called the classic ($21.99) most resembles the dish in the Chinese fable. Though it’s listed as dinner for two, it easily feeds three.', 'As a server carries soup to the table the opaque white broth laps against the sides of the bowl. According to the traditional recipe, it has been made by boiling chicken, bones and all for six hours, resulting in a creamy emulsification. Ingredients bob within the soup, including shrimp balls, baby bok choi, Spam, enoki mushrooms, shredded chicken, crisp tidbits of fried pig skin, and fingers of fish paste that do an astonishing imitation of gefilte fish.', 'Man, this soup is great! There are a dozen versions of it, including the most expensive one called happy ending ($42.99), which includes extra seafood like shrimp and crab stick. A separate menu section lists $2 to $5 additions like king trumpet mushrooms, geoduck, sea cucumber, and dried bean curd.', 'Two versions of mixian, scallion pancakes, a menu that listing of “amazing chicken” (shredded chicken with chiles), cucumbers, and more. ', 'I’d also recommend the hot and sour rice noodles ($6.75), a bowl shot with pickled green chiles, chunks of beef, and scallions, while a miasma of chile oil spreads across the top of the bowl like an oil slick on calm waters. There’s also mixian version of chicken chow fun — a take on that old Chinese-American fave that doesn’t quite work.', 'Don’t forget about the apps, a collection of small dishes ($3 to $5) found in nearly every modern Chinese restaurant in town, whether the food originates in Sichuan, Henan, or Dongbei. But here, they’re so good they should not be ignored, from the crushed cukes gobbed with garlic to the beef tendon shaved thin in chile oil. Steamed edamame is a tip of the hat to the Japanese, but the favorite is the “dress old preserved egg” of the black, translucent, thousand-year-old variety, roughly mashed with green chiles and sesame oil and served warm.  You’d be hard pressed to find a better starter at any price.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one app and a shared version of crossing the bridge noodles, plus tax but not tip, $25', 'Sample Dishes: Happy ending rice noodles, hot and sour rice noodles, scallion pancakes, pumpkin cake, amazing chicken', 'What to Drink: Cold tea is provided with a meal, gratis. There’s not much else apart from Chinese sodas.', 'Bonus Tips: While crossing the bridge noodles are generally mellow and mild, several bottled condiments stand at the ready to spice it up. The most fascinating is designated “zanthoxylum oil” on the bottle, which imparts an unusual tingle to the tongue, lips, and throat.']"

And eat solo — #SadDeskLunch style.', 'No offense. It’s not you. It’s just… lunch, the least fun meal of the workday. It’s hard to have a good time with meetings and deadlines looming. Moreover, the standard downtown fare is rarely worth the time it takes to eat it anyway. A three-hour, three-martini outing would be a blast, but who really does that on a regular basis anymore?', 'I’m not alone in my anti-lunch sentiments: Americans ate 433 million fewer midday meals out last year; 2016 was the lowest lunch traffic in four decades according to market research firm NPD.', 'Delivery is up, and company cafeterias are taking over.

By bringing contemporary (organic, local, sustainable) ingredients to the classic lunch-counter model, first-time restaurateur Harper Matheson hopes to revive a dying tradition: the lunch date.', 'City Counter’s tagline, “Quality Luncheonette” — scrawled on every plate in an evocative cursive — rings true. The cozy, old-school feelings it purports to conjure up, though, not so much.', 'Matheson wrote on her Kickstarter page: “I don’t want to just serve you a delicious, satisfying sandwich. I want to make you feel the way I did when my mom took me to lunch after we got my prom dress in Union Square.”', 'Hmm. Admirable, except the vibe feels more like “I just got an iPhone.” All white, from the tile to the 30 stools lining the 40-foot-long counter to the two-tops set against a wall of windows, City Counter looks more 2017 Apple Genius Bar than 1940s Woolworth’s lunch counter — mixed with 1980s bat mitzvah DJ. “We Are Family” and “Got to Be Real” blare overhead at a decibel level that’s a little too much for lunch. Then again, maybe Matheson is just trying to up the “fun”?', 'She’s done a bit of a better job upping the food, giving the sandwich the love and attention that, oddly enough, very few downtown lunch spots — other than Dennis Leary’s take-out window, the Sentinel — do.', 'Consulting chef Sean Thomas, of Blue Plate, came up with nine sandwiches that defy the typical grilled turkey-and-cheese scenario. All are made-to-order yet magically served within minutes (key for any successful lunch spot).', 'And some are noticeably better than others. Like the Mezzogiorno: a fatty, fabulous hot mess of pistachio-studded mortadella, roasted pork loin and belly, smoked mozzarella, and hot cherry peppers on toasted Acme white bread. The tuna melt, closed-faced on toasted sourdough, with red onion, pickled celery, and a gooey, delicious three-cheese fondue, reminds me that tuna melts, when done right, deserve some respect.', 'The roast beef is stuffed with slow-cooked tri-tip, on the rare side and sliced thin, with spicy pickled carrots and red peppers on a roll smeared with garlic aioli and a house-made pimento cheese spread that I was happy to see again, as a $1 addition to the deviled egg salad sandwich.', 'You’ve got to be a real deviled egg lover to love that one. As just a deviled egg liker, I was overwhelmed by what seemed like a carton’s worth crammed between two slices of soft, unapologetic white bread. I was lured by the promise of “crushed salt & vinegar chips” inside the sandwich. A brilliant idea, but unfortunately, there was barely any crunch.', 'I’m also a beet hater. Blasphemy, I know. But from across the table (the only table in the long narrow space, by the way, that fits a trio and comes with chairs), I could appreciate the beauty of the Reubenesque: smoked red and golden beets pressed between thick slabs of perfectly toasted rye, with pickled cabbage and sharp cheddar that oozed like strawberry swirl. I tried one bite and it tasted like… beets, as beets do; my friend devoured the rest. He declared the beets to be a little too flimsy. I declared I wish City Counter had a real Reuben. Or at least a patty melt.', 'It would no doubt be better than the Counter Club, which was too bready and bulky to determine if there was indeed anything counter about it.', 'The salads, however, were crisp and creative. Despite the fact that they were so overdressed they’d make a Chez Panisse chef shiver, they beat any I’ve ever brought back to my office. The fresh peas and dried raspberries in the chopped spring pea were drowning in an otherwise tangy masala yogurt dressing. Purple and orange carrots, just pulled from the ground, were almost unidentifiable due to an abundance of a kaffir lime tahini in the roasted carrot. And the crispy chickpea and tuna: chunks of fresh tuna, cherry tomatoes, and (addictive) garlic peanuts came in a pool of Thousand Island dressing so deep, even my grandfather — who ate it by the bowl — would’ve disapproved.', 'But everyone’s grandmother — as well as non-gluttons of all ages — will applaud the aptly named Grammy Sammy: a single piece of white bread, spread with “counter sauce” (a mild garlic-Worcestershire aioli) and folded over a slice of mortadella and smoked cheddar. The menu states the Grammy Sammy “changes daily,” but it’s been the same since they opened, the smiley woman behind the iPad said.', 'No matter. It’s simple and sustaining and half the price of a latte at Blue Bottle next door. A decent $3 sandwich is a welcome addition to downtown San Francisco.', 'As is City Counter itself. It’s neither a power lunch nor a pathetic lunch, but a proper lunch.

98,"['Taste of Cochin offers Keralan cuisine that’s not commonly found in New York', 'For much of the 20th century, we New Yorkers have contented ourselves with Punjabi, Bengali, and Gujarati fare, feasting on brown-sauced curries, tandoori chicken, and a wealth of colorful vegetarian dishes. But the last decade has brought the ascendance of South Indian food and the opening of dozens of new dosa places, as well as restaurants devoted in whole or in part to the cuisines of Chennai and Hyderabad, for example. ', 'But it’s in Eastern Queens right on Union Turnpike where you’ll find a less common cuisine represented at Taste of Cochin, serving dishes from the palm-shaded state of Kerala on India’s rainy southwestern coast. For centuries a center of the international spice trade visited by Arab, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, and English mariners, Kerala has historically harbored Islamic, Jewish, and Christian communities, each with its own dietary preferences and restrictions. The cuisine showcases seafood, palm products, curry leaves, coconuts, black mustard seed, black peppercorns, and beef — the latter an ingredient rarely seen elsewhere in India due to the cow’s sacred nature to many Hindus.', 'Flanked by a full bar, the dining room is big and boxy, with dark red walls and draperies that lend a somber vibe. A buffet so long it runs along two walls packs the place on weekend afternoons ($10.95), where diners shovel some very good food from several regions of India onto their plates, though only about a quarter of the buffet’s 25 dishes hail from South India.', 'Defect from the buffet and even the bound menu, and seek out the paper menu found in a stack by the front door. Listed under Kerala Specialties, you’ll find regional dishes like fish moilly ($12.95), with chunks of firm white fish populating a gravy thickened with coconut milk and colored an eye-searing yellow by turmeric. Whole green chiles and curry leaves enrich the flavor, with the occasional carrot thrown in for sweetness and color. ', 'Bring friends to try several dishes from this regional section of the menu, where fish dishes abound: In addition to that fish moilly, there’s Malabar fish curry ($13.95) made with rich and oily kingfish immersed in a sauce made with a toasted spice mixture and a dab of tomato sauce, which turns it a lovely shade of burnt orange. (That same kingfish is available coated with spices, breaded, and fried like fish and chips.)', 'Also associated with the coastal region is a multilayered bread called Malabar paratha ($1.50), which the host will urge on you if you neglect to order it. Thank him, because the flaky flatbread is perfect for mopping up sauces.', 'Don’t miss the beef dishes on the Keralan menu, many of which are the subject of yearly festivals in Kochi, the modern-day name for the city of Cochin. Beef ularthiyathu ($12.95)  features a sauceless dice of tender meat that’s mildly spiced so the flavor of the beef shines. Goat is another focus on the menu, but you’ll have to go to the Goat and Lamb Entrees section to dig out “goat masala (Cochin style)” and goat vindaloo, representing two spicy renditions of the meat. The latter is associated with Goa, a former Portuguese colony (now a beach resort).', 'Great vegetarian dishes abound in Kerala, including aviyal ($8.95), a sea-green curry of chayote and long beans awash in coconut milk; and theeyal, a fragrant vegetable soup flavored with fenugreek, tamarind, and toasted coconut. Taste of Cochin offers a handful of dosas, too, but these vegetarian crepes are better at restaurants that specialize in them, such as the nearby Hillside Dosa Hutt.', 'Perhaps the most surprising ingredient found in Keralan cooking here is duck. And maybe the proximity of the restaurant to sources of Long Island’s famed duck is why the waterfowl is so good at Taste of Cochin. Dip your Malabar paratha into the thick, dark sauce of duck curry ($14.95) and know gastronomic heaven, borne of a culinary culture rich in herbs, spices, and coconut milk.

99,"['It was an abrupt goodbye, but not a sad one. Boxing Room, Hayes Valley’s Creole-and-cocktails spot, never quite caught on. It was the kind of restaurant you’d book because it had availability on OpenTable, not necessarily because you were in the mood for fried alligator. So it wasn’t all that surprising when, one day, it was no longer there, and suddenly, in its stead, stood a tapas place called Barcino. ', 'Almost overnight — well, technically, within two weeks — the esteemed Absinthe Group overhauled the sprawling space, swapping po’ boys for paella and immediately bringing buzz to a corner that had lost it. ', 'Dying to try Barcino! the people posted. SOMA’s Spanish-inspired Bellota, from whence chef Ryan McIlwraith came, was such an insta-success that everyone expected Barcino to be, too. ', 'Myself included. I ate at Bellota only once, and it was a memorable meal. My three dinners at Barcino, however, were more… fine bordering on forgettable. Few dishes —and we ordered a lot — made a lasting impression. ', 'But my gin and tonic, enjoyed at the tail end of the heat wave, did. Choosing a G and a T was fun, like one of those mix-and-match word games people play on airplanes. Aided by the cheery bartender, of the 54 gins, I picked the citrusy Four Pillars Dry from Australia and the 1724, an effervescent, fruity tonic from Patagonia refreshing enough to sip on its own. Together it was even better. Served in a bulbous glass and adorned with slices of orange, lime, and lemon, along with twists, plus sprigs of rosemary and thyme and a bay leaf magically contorted around a toothpick, it was cocktail art — and a reasonable $13. (Or have I just been San Franciscoified?)', 'The patatas, too, would singlehandedly lure me back to Barcino. Typically a throwaway order at most tapas places, here, potatoes of all things were the highlight. They looked more like Kara’s Cupcakes than like the largest, most delicious tater tots I’ve ever had: golden, crackling-crisp cups frosted with a creamy, pale green, charred scallion aioli and sprinkled with blackened scallion “dust.” After wolfing down our one-patata-per-person allotment, our trio battled forks over the fourth. ', 'We attacked our gorgeous raw bar platter with equal gusto. The octopus — chewy, tender chunks marinated in a cucumber-celery salpicon with smoky chorizo — was the first to go. Followed by the dry-aged strip loin carpaccio, sliced paper-thin, rubbed with black truffle, then wrapped around the Luke Cage of breadsticks, with sweet tomato jam.', 'Otherwise, most of the plates fell in the middle of the pack, like a team in preseason training with potential, but still struggling to cross the finish line. Oddly, every dish recommended by our robotic server lacked excitement as much as he did. The watermelon in the watermelon salad tasted like a watermelon I let sit on my counter too long before cutting up — not like the fresh, vitalizing fruit it should be when mingled with heirloom tomatoes, mint, and Persian cucumber for $14. ', 'The “Ou” was also recommended. It sounded good: a bright yellow sunny-side-up egg set over a mound of mini potato chips that looked like a pile of gold, with slices of jamon and a healthy spoonful of paddlefish caviar. What’s not to love? It turned out that wilted chips and mushy caviar in an eggy-fishy combo fell flat. I would have rather eaten my jamon Iberico de bellotta without all the fanfare. The Coca, Spanish flatbread spread with foie gras, pickled peaches, and membrillo (a sweet quince paste), harkened back to the Smuckers jam on chewy-hard days-old white bread I ate as a kid. The foie was a sophisticated stand-in for peanut butter, but not enough in itself to salvage the $24 tapa.', 'It was the paella — arguably the star of any Spanish menu — that came in last. We were told that it would take 40 minutes to prepare. Expected and no biggie. But because the rest of our dishes arrived in such quick succession — and on one occasion, before our cava (hey, just like at Duna!) — the lag time for the paella was long enough that we actually forgot, for a second, that we’d ordered it. When it arrived in its pan, the handle was wrapped in white linen. A warning: hot! Except it wasn’t. Rather, it was a lukewarm paella scattered with sizable prawns and sweet heirloom peppers and microgreens, shredded pork shoulder — and fat strips of pork belly that were more tough than tender and seemed out of place, like whales on the beach.', 'Suddenly I missed chorizo. I missed mussels. I didn’t want pork belly in my paella. (And yet, on all three nights, the daily-changing dish came with it.) I just wanted a muddle of rich, distinct flavors. I wanted to taste individual kernels of rice. I wanted even just a little crunch. I scraped the bottom of the pan in search of soccarrat, but there was none. It was a $50 disappointment. ', 'Which brings me to my main beef with Barcino. Cocktails notwithstanding, it was expensive for a mostly mediocre meal with moments of glory (which included the churro s’mores, which will forever ruin you for the graham-cracker kind, served open-faced with vanilla marshmallow and chocolate ganache). Still, two hundred bucks for two, before tip, with one lone glass of wine (albeit a crisp, moderately priced albarino from Rias Baixas) is something only high-flying San Francisco will support. ', 'And clearly it’s currently happy to, given the nightly crowds filling the booths, the bar, the tables tucked behind an oversized metal trellis that — without even more lovely leafy plants lining it — left me feeling like I was eating my lamb meatballs with saffron-braised noodles behind bars. ', 'But when the bubble bursts or even punctures (and it will eventually), I have to say: I probably wouldn’t put my money on Barcino. ', 'I know it’s wrong to compare siblings, but as its eldest sister approaches its 20th anniversary — having survived the city’s highs and lows — I can’t help but wonder about Barcino’s staying power. Perhaps, and I hope, with a little more practice — and more of those patatas — it will go the way of Absinthe, not Boxing Room.', 'Cost: If you’re restrained in ordering, you could probably get out of there for $150 (two drinks, one raw bar item, two tapas, one paella, one dessert) before tax and tip. Paellas range from $38 to $50 and serve two to four. ', 'What to eat: Toasted catalan tomato bread, barra crua (raw bar), patatas, albondiga (lamb meatballs, with currants and chive labneh and saffron-braised noodles, which were more satisfying on my third visit than on my first).', 'What to drink: The Troupe, the gin and tonics, the Barca (a clean, sherried, gin cocktail), the Vermut if only because of the pretty hobnail glass it’s served in.']"
100,"['Three stars for the Flatiron newcomer', 'In the basement of Cote — the Korean-American steakhouse that opened in Flatiron in June — a curated locker filled with meat sits behind a giant plate glass window. USDA prime strips, tomahawks, and porterhouses rest on steel racks or dangle from hooks. The cuts are marked by tags that flutter like a swarm of moths, each one denoting how long it has been dry-aging. ', 'The room glows red. Owner Simon Kim says the red lighting makes the “meat look sexier,” which is only partially accurate; the steaks aged for half a year look like petrified driftwood.', 'I think of this museum exhibit of meat when I watch my server torching a rib-eye over a gold-rimmed grill set in the middle of a grey soapstone table in the dining room. I slather the meat in sweet-spicy ssamjang sauce and wrap it in a lettuce leaf, which I promptly eat, and which fills my mouth with the perfume of beef and barnyard. I pair this with a small glass of frozen rosé, also known as frosé, which I suck up through a pink flamingo straw. ', 'In the domain of the American steakhouse, an institution dedicated to blood, beef, men, money, and martinis, few things disappoint the way dry-aged beef often does. That’s not to disrespect this celebrated form of charcuterie, wherein beef hangs in a climate-controlled room to concentrate flavor and develop a funk like a good blue cheese. But more often than not, servings would be better articulated as a single small course in a tasting than an entree the size of a catcher’s mitt. To continue the metaphor: Would you really want to eat an entire wheel of Stilton in one sitting? ', 'Some restaurants get around this dilemma by putting less age on their steaks. Cote, by contrast, allows for a more elegant and flavorful solution: You order your dry-aged beef not as an oversized entree but rather as part of a $45 prix fixe that includes all the food a person needs on a given night — and then some. That heady rib-eye is all of four or five bites. Then you move onto wagyu flat iron that’s not aged, followed by marinated short rib.', 'The people behind this chic restaurant still know how to overindulge; excess, after all, is the point of a steakhouse. But they also know not to annihilate your palate with the beef they cultivate in their crimson basement quarantine zone.', 'Cote —  a slickly designed restaurant split into bench-tables up front and cushier booths in the back and a standing table that bisects the space — is one of the city’s most exhilarating places to eat beef. That’s an unexpected superlative for a steakhouse that peddles frosé or a restaurant that some might not even consider a steakhouse. ', 'The standard classification for a venue like Cote is a Korean barbecue spot, but taxonomically, an institution that pairs red meat with vegetable sides, starches, and copious amounts of alcohol is just as much a member of the larger steakhouse community as Keens or a Sparks. ', 'What distinguishes Cote from the pack is the fact that Kim and chef David Shim embrace the affinities between Korean barbecue spots and stereotypically American bastions of beef. Some of their riffs are obvious. Shim presents a cool wedge salad with tofu sesame dressing instead of blue cheese, shrimp over ice with a spicy gochujang-laced dip instead of cocktail sauce, as well as a thin fan of house-smoked pork belly with jalapenos instead of steak-like slab bacon. ', 'Others differences are more subtle. Clubby blinds are banished in favor of open windows: Passers-by can see straight through to the bar’s pink neon sign to the modern artwork hanging in back. Expensive combo platters, typical of Korean grill spots, are nixed in favor of that affordable prix-fixe, called a “Butcher’s Feast,” which means even a solo diner can sample a tasting menu of four different cuts — and too many banchan to count — for a fair price.', 'Almost every meal at Cote includes dry-aged rib-eye –– rarely found at Korean grill spots — sliced from cuts that’ve hung for at least 45 days, versus the more traditional 28 days. Here, that age difference translates into every bite with a nutty aroma that doesn’t detract from the flavor. ', 'Customers with more cash can sample meats aged even longer: A 150-day aged strip, seldom seen in any city restaurant, runs $99. That oversized steak recalls a good Iberico and, with a muskiness that’s almost past prime, is not for everyone. But for lovers of dry-aged beef, what Cote offers here is sublime.', ""Keep in mind that Cote’s Shinpo smokeless grills, like at most Korean grill spots, don't produce the same level of char as a French pan roast, or a Peter Luger-style broiler. This style of cookery results in a less intense Maillard reaction that’s about browning for flavor. And that’s okay, because the softer cooking coaxes the flavors of the meat regardless."", 'The meal unfurls at a slower pace than at a high turnover Korean spot like New Wonjo or Jongro BBQ. Your waiter, who does most of the cooking, kicks off the Butcher’s Feast with hanger steak, which she sears for no more than two minutes, then disappears to tend to a grill at another table. The cut tastes of blood and salt, with a tang of offal. The waiter then reappears and prepares the Kobe flat iron, then scoots away again, before coming back for chuck flap (a $38 supplement), which collapses in the mouth with the ease of lobster knuckle and bursts with a clean meatiness. You get used to this efficient back-and-forth which feels less obtrusive than the constant clearing of silverware and re-plating at a tasting menu venue.', 'The last cut of beef is galbi, short rib marinated in sweet soy mirin. It’s grilled nice and long, resulting in a crusty, sugary chew. If all this flesh and fat, whether dry-aged or not, sounds like a bit much, keep in mind you have a table full of banchan to quell the funk, from jalapeno-topped, pickled chayote, to sweet cured squid, to a giant preserved perilla leaf, to a fluffy egg soufflé that could easily command $20 at a Soho brunch spot. ', 'Unlike potatoes and creamed spinach, banchan delivers balance to the meal, making this Korean-American steakhouse a better spot for enjoying 45-day, dry-aged beef than just about any other restaurant.', 'The meal winds down with a bowl of spicy kimchi stew to aid digestion, and then a tiny, tart cup of soft serve — a more logical coda than a giant slice of chocolate cake, or a $35 sundae. ', 'That’s the brilliance of Kim and Shim: They put together a menu based on international eclecticism rather than American steakhouse dogma, a lesson that the city’s stodgy purveyors of beef could heed. At Cote, the future of the New York steakhouse is looking outward, not inward. ', 'Cost: Butcher’s block tasting — enough food for most people — runs $45 per person. A la carte appetizers range from $12 to $18, while individual cuts of meat run $34 (hanger steak) to $44 (dry-aged rib-eye). Extra-dry aged cuts for two can command $99 or more.', 'Sample dishes: Wedge salad with bacon and tofu sesame dressing, steak tartare, Korean pork belly, spicy kimchi stew, dry-aged rib-eye, angel hair pasta with apples and iceberg lettuce, soft-serve.', 'Bonus Tip: Walk-ins accepted, but waits can be long. Keep in mind that only small plates (boneless Korean fried chicken, blood sausages) are available at the standing-only bar.']"

Inside a flattened egg flapjack flecked with scallions lurk a plethora of freshly shucked oysters. This omelet may have inspired one of the first Chinese-American dishes created during the California Gold Rush and called Hangtown fry. But the contemporary Taiwanese rendition has globs of translucent sweet-potato starch, which play tag with the bivalves, creating a confusion as to what kind of goo you’re eating at the moment.', ""Among dim sum you'll also find tempura-style chicken cutlets, fluffy buns drizzled with sweetened condensed milk, fried squid balls (which the menu lists as calamari), and, tastiest of all, something called pork roll ($6.95). Tender pieces of pork are cradled inside a tube of fried tofu skin, making a crunchy and mellow snack that can be shared by several diners as an appetizer."", ""The central menu panel features full-meal soups, offering a choice of four kinds of noodles: wheat spaghetti, mung-bean vermicelli, and flat or round rice noodles. Of the many bowls I tried, my favorite, number 52, was beef stew and tendon with flat rice noodles ($7.50). In it, magnificent wobbly chunks of tendon vie with richly textured stew beef for the attention of your chopsticks. The broth is red and slightly spicy. Go for the pig feet if you'd like gluier noodles and head for the beef and hot pepper noodles ($8.50) for spicy noodles."", 'Holy basil makes an appearance in some dishes, such as the national dish of Taiwan, popularly known as ""three cup chicken,"" which the menu lists as chicken with ginger and basil ($11.95), though it includes sesame oil, rice wine, and soy sauce that\'s cooked down to a sweet, basil-scented sludge here. A vegetarian version using eggplant is also quite agreeable.', 'The menu showcases organ meats like pig bowel, pig’s ears, and pork and beef stomachs, along with other surprising ingredients like pickled mustard greens paired with oblong rice cakes. Many dishes have playful names, often not listed on the English menu. One is fly heads ($11.95), listed in English as as minced pork with black beans.

Helped along by Frances Mayes’ book-turned-movie, Under the Tuscan Sun, Americans were besotted with the region’s simple and elegant cooking. We savored pungent pecorino and rustic salami as a first course, just-made pastas lightly sauced as a second, and third courses of meat, fish, or fowl unencumbered by sides or starches. And the cuisine’s emphasis on fresh and locally sourced ingredients was to profoundly influence New York dining in the decades that followed.', 'But, once translated into the American dining idiom, there was little in this sea of red-sauced abnegation that could be described as truly Tuscan. We simply lacked the original ingredients and the will to faithfully replicate the cuisine. Chefs came to use the term as code for any approach that emphasized pasta and a greater proportion of produce, ushering in an era when even TV dinners and cans of cat food were labeled “Tuscan.”', 'Real Tuscan restaurants in the city have remained rare. Some of the best have been founded by expat Tuscan chefs like Rita Sodi (I Sodi and Via Carota) and Cesare Casella (the now-closed Beppe and Maremma). Now we have another: Fiaschetteria Pistoia — named for the straw-basketed Chianti bottle — opened a few months ago at 11th and C. This improbably located spot was founded by Emanuele Bugiani, whose family owns Fiaschetteria La Pace in Pistoia, a trattoria 30 kilometers northwest of Florence.', 'Several of the antipasti have Florentine origins. There’s pappa col pomodoro ($10), a brightly colored porridge of bread crumbs and tomatoes that tastes like a bowlful of summer sunshine. Few New York restaurants have had the testicoli to serve it (Tribeca’s Pepolino is the only other I know of), since the dish looks like something intended for babies and invalids. Another Florentine dish, sformatino di zucchine is also found among antipasti, a flan flecked with summer squash in a delicate Parmigiano sauce.', 'A dish you’d find everywhere in the sunflower-strewn Tuscan countryside is crostini Toscani ($13). This plate of toasts deploying the region’s notoriously saltless bread — said to be a medieval response to a papal salt tax — comes with a creamy puree of chicken livers redolent of sage and other herbs. Skip the more elaborate version with mushrooms and baked ham: The livers are heavenly enough.', 'Yes, you can get prosciutto San Daniele from northern Italy. Here, it’s sliced on the red, hand-cranked slicer that’s the focus of the dining room and turns heads every time the waiter steps up to it. Better still is the prosciutto Toscano. Every hilltop town in Tuscany has its own version of this cured-but-not-cooked ham, which slices up salty and funky and a bit lighter than its more expensive San Daniele counterpart.', 'The décor at this restaurant might be termed East Village rustic, including the usual rickety tables, tin ceilings, and crumbling walls, forming the local equivalent, I suppose, of a rural osteria in the Tuscan countryside. Posters of canned food products dating from the 60s adorn the walls, perhaps the work of some Italian Andy Warhol. In the back corner is a pasta-making machine, and one of the cooks frequently steps out of the kitchen to tend it, making pastas that, if not all Tuscan, are uniformly delicious.', 'Why the pasta menu departs from its purely Tuscan agenda is unclear, but we have a very nice cacio e pepe ($16), using fettuccine laved in a Roman sauce of pecorino and black peppercorns, the latter ground a little too fine. Pappardelle in a Bolognese ragu is also available along with gnocchi with pesto such as might be found in Genoa. The most purely Tuscan pasta is a broad noodle here called by its generic name of maccheroni in a chunky wild-boar sauce. All are quite fantastic, but make sure you examine the brief specials menu before ordering a second course. It often includes gnudi, which are wrapper-free ravioli made popular in New York by April Bloomfield at the Spotted Pig. Looking like ping pong balls flattened by a forearm smash, this version features spinach and cheese.', 'As in a Tuscan roadhouse, the secondi menu presents only three or four choices per evening that once again range over Central Italy, and might include baccala alla Livornese, meatballs in sauce, veal scallopine, or, on one occasion, an olive-oiled New York strip ($30): a decent imitation of beefsteak Florentine. That the specials menu had called it a veal roast didn’t bother me. In an old-fashioned Tuscan way the proprietor was simply providing the best of what he had to offer.', 'Cost: Three course dinner for two, including two antipasti, a shared pasta, and a shared second course, with a bottle of wine and tax but not tip, $120.', 'Sample dishes: Sample dishes: pappa col pomodoro (tomato-and-bread porridge), Tuscan prosciutto, macherroni sul cinghiale (fresh pasta with wild boar sauce)', 'What to drink: The limited wine list is charmingly presented in an antique carry-around rack brought to your table, including a few bottles of red and a few bottles of white. Carmignano ($43) is a red blend of sangiovese and cabernet sauvignon that has been made in a region just northwest of Florence since the 16th Century. The producer is Tenuta di Capezzana, a historic vineyard that regularly produces spectacular bottles that score two or three glasses in the Slow Food wine guide. Available by glass, quartino, or bottle, the house red (a montepulciano d’Abruzzo) ain’t bad, either, at about half the price.']"

So I ignored my pretty antique floral-patterned bowl of garlicky, house-made yogurt mixed with cultured kefir cream and brimming with bits of cool, garden-fresh cucumber, crumbled pecans, and a whole lot of dill, while I waited, for quite some time, for my glass of orange-hued rebula.

Accompanied by candlelight.', 'It’s the “casual” part of Duna I found confusing. It’s a compliment, really: Balla and Burns’s modern Central European fare deserves full service. Or at least some service.', 'After three visits, I’m not convinced this kind of quickie, truncated experience works for Duna.

We got seconds every time, as the dips — creamy, vibrant — routinely outlasted it. Standouts include roasted pumpkin seed doused with hot green chile and grapeseed oil; sweet preserved eggplant scattered with preserved kumquats and sprigs of mint; a spicy Liptauer paprika cheese thick with onion, garlic, and toasted sesame seeds that was reminiscent, in the very best way, of Trader Joe’s jalapeno pub cheese. When the last tear of bread was gone, rather than bother ordering another, we scraped the rest with our spoons.', 'The chopped salads — served family style, like every dish at Duna — are supposed to be eaten with spoons, too. I used my fork for the Sofia, which was essentially just a Greek salad named after the capital of Bulgaria. Nothing special, nothing more. But the Budapest was a bowl of beauty. A brightly colored jumble of bold flavors: juicy red tomatoes (cherry, Early Girl, and heirlooms), fiery electric-green padrons, and soft cubes of Point Reyes’s toma tossed with slices of smoky sausage, rings of piquant peppers, button mushrooms, and finished with plenty of paprika. The dressing — the vegetables’ natural juices soaked in red vinegar with garlic and marjoram — was simple and soupy and indeed worth slurping. ', 'Balla and Burns have tried, yet again, to transform the formerly dull Herbivore space into something warm and woodsy, with bark and branches, woolly art and leafy plants. Intended to resemble the banks of the Danube River — for which Duna was named, perhaps? — it works well enough, but that drab gray institutional tiled floor will remain a thorn in Duna’s decor until they decide to do a real redesign.', 'Admittedly, no one but the critic seemed to care.

I also wondered if the Old World had teeth, as almost every entree had the same texture. That is: none, really. It was like a mushy, madly flavorful meal a sophisticated baby could love.', 'A duo of cabbage rolls stuffed with chicken and pork snuggling beside slippery house-made sauerkraut, slices of smoked sausage and pork belly, meaty roasted mushrooms, and dried apples was at once delicate and hardy. The chicken paprikas, in a thick, pungent gravy poured over eggy, soft spatzle was just as satisfying. Only the lentil croquettes were a disappointment. A beloved holdover from Balla and Burns’s Bar Tartine days, but made over at Duna, they were dense and dry. Luckily they were surrounded by a gorgeous assembly of roasted spinach, turmeric-tinged cauliflower, and chile-infused yogurt — all of which we devoured.', 'But we abandoned our croquettes. Like the staff did our otherwise empty dishes, which cluttered our table throughout the entire meal — until eventually I had to text someone to take them away.', '“Sunday suppers” at Duna are ticketed, intended to be a more civilized, supposedly slower affair, with cultural themes like “Road Trip to Southern Bulgaria” and “Paprika and Onion.” We’d reserved two seats on the “Boat Trip to Belgrade” (which must have been a speedboat, because somehow our $170 meal was over within 52 minutes). We relished our lively yogurt soup; mild lamb tartare peppered with raisins and parsley; and spicy, rich rock-cod stew nonetheless.', 'But nothing was as good as Duna’s dips. Especially not dessert: a tasteless frozen custard coated in a parched black-sesame crumble that left me wishing for its doppelganger — Carvel’s crunchies — instead.

Nope. They add a little too much pickled cabbage slaw, but on heavy, handmade corn tortillas, I loved them all anyway.

My companion enjoyed them with a warm glass of sauvignon blanc.', 'The steak for two (or three or four)  is a staple at any bastion of beef, but the Beatrice’s whiskey steak is unique in being the subject of a 650-word profile in Vogue, a fashion publication that’s not particularly known for its meat coverage. An Eater video of the boozy beef has garnered millions of Facebook views.', 'When a waiter walks us through the menu, it’s the second dish he mentions. He does not volunteer the price, but he does explain how Mar wraps a Tomahawk rib-eye in a whiskey-soaked cloth and lets it age for half a year  — a technique she learned from French celebrity butcher Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec. She presents it with lobster butter, thyme, and summer truffles. ', 'Those who have sampled this delicacy tell me the booze imparts the meat with notes of oak and vanilla. Curiously enough, none of the Internet commotion over the meat mentions precisely what you’ll end up paying for it. ', 'I ask a staffer about the MP. He replies not with a specific price but with the per-ounce cost, which, that night was $14 an ounce, with a minimum of 50 ounces. That works out to over $900 after tax and tip. ', 'I opt for the only other steak, a cote de boeuf with crustacean butter. The beef exhibits impressive tenderness, but the flavor is neutral, without any of the bovine musk or concentrated beefiness you’d expected from 60 days of dry aging. It’s not a particularly memorable cut, and yet at around $75, it might be the city’s highest entry-level price for a steak.', 'Once upon a time, in the mid-to-late aughts, The Beatrice was a storied social club with a door policy so tight even Amanda Seyfried reportedly had trouble getting in once. It was only after 2012 when Vanity Fair’s Graydon Carter turned The Beatrice Inn into a proper culinary establishment. Sort of. The restaurant went through more chefs than I care to list and garnered a zero star New York Times review. Angie Mar was hired in 2013 but the restaurant was still more of a scene early in her tenure. During a Halloween party, where I’m certain I was the only person under six feet tall, I recall almost having my nose broken when a drunk partygoer, who I’m told was flashing people, fell onto my face.', 'As an intermittent regular over the past four years or so, I can confirm that since Mar bought out the prevailing ownership last year, the restaurant feels more ambitious than ever. If April Bloomfield is the city’s greatest meat chef, then Mar is starting to show some of the creativity and skill to take a shot at that title one day. She’s taken the staid and steady format of the chophouse and introduced an energizing degree of variety into it, serving up smoked $87 rabbits, $72 smoked pork chops (brilliantly juicy with too much blubbery fat), and Gruyere-stuffed lobster that costs . . . actually how much does it cost?', '“It’s $90 tonight,” a waiter says. That’s actually not too bad by Beatrice standards. A few minutes later the waiter returns and informs us that the lobsters are unusually small and the dish is typically in the $120 range — just so we don’t get the wrong idea.', 'The steakhouse, chophouse, meatery — whatever you want to call it — has always been a quintessential American luxury, a more societally acceptable way to spend gobs of cash than on a tasting of thirty-six courses that look like Abstract Expressionist spin art. These dark and boozy institutions have championed the large-format way of life — porterhouses for two, lobsters older than a middle school graduate — decades before David Chang ever started asking diners to reserve $200 pork shoulders weeks in advance. ', 'Even within this genre, The Beatrice veers too heavily toward the one percent. That’s not to overlook the fact that two of the restaurant’s cheapest mains are two of the best: Oxtail with prunes, thyme, and mashed potatoes ($32) is a beefy, sweet, starchy pairing of spoonable textures. And pork braised in milk ($34) is nearly dessert in its own right, the swine wafting sage in a thickened pool of barely sweet dairy. ', 'But still. I can’t think of another chophouse where the only cooked lamb dish is a $135 rack, where the only guaranteed bread service is a $23 savory tart, where the only sundae is a $27 banana split, and where the chef has removed the affordable burger from the menu in favor of a regal $38 blend.', 'That dry-aged burger, with a texture that evokes pate and a flavor I’d describe as the apotheosis of beef, is spectacular. When you ask a waiter about it, the first thing he mentions is that you’re welcome to order it with a few grams of black truffles. What he doesn’t mention is that the supplement bumps the price up to $105.', 'You can walk right into The Beatrice in 2017, something that surely wasn’t possible for this Banana Republic-wearing critic a decade ago, but the current prices are a reminder that accessibility takes many forms. As much as Mar deserves credit for the intricate aging and infusion processes involved in the whiskey steak, it’s hard not to feel slightly unwelcome when you realize that no one has found a way to show off this compelling technique to those who lack the desire or means to blow airfare for two to Los Angeles on a single main course.', 'Drinking Cocktails at The Beatrice', 'My favorite way to experience this West Village haunt is to swing by the dimly-lit bar for (crazily expensive) cocktails: creative luxuries that jibe with an upscale chophouse. Here are a few selections:', 'Laphroaig Champagne Cocktail: Champagne, lemon, sugar, and “mist of Islay single malt.” Laphroaig could normally overpower a pot roast, but here, it adds a delicate layer of peaty complexity ($23).', 'Big Poppa: White truffle gin shaken with egg white, yuzu, yellow chartreuse, and gold dust. A\xa0remarkably accurate introduction to the pungent aroma of white truffle without overpowering — or overcharging ($16).\xa0', 'Smoked Manhattan: Rittenhouse rye stirred with Grand Marnier and sweet vermouth presented inside a crystal decanter filled with cherrywood smoke. The high proof rye and smokey bitterness make this the appropriate pairing for the $102 duck.', 'Gin & Tonic: Black Forest gin in a giant goblet filled with rosemary, juniper berries, and lavender. This quaffable snow globe is difficult to drink (thanks to the floating peppercorns) and obnoxiously priced ($23), but it’s a gorgeously aromatic G&T.\xa0', '“It’s no secret I’m not a huge fan of vegetables,” Mar tells me over the phone. This is clear when I order the $32 side of ramps with summer truffles, which tastes like $5 worth of ramps with truffle flavor. A few weeks later a waiter tries to sell me some truffled snow pea leaves for the same price. No thanks.', 'You don’t come to The Beatrice for snow peas: You come for meat, seafood, and pie. In fact this is a rare venue where an all-pie meal is possible. You start off with that plum tart for two I was telling you about, a chewy pastry packed with stone fruit and showered with arugula and Parmesan. This splendid affair, only faintly sweet, is available even in the winter. “I don’t care if things are local I just want the best product,” Mar tells me.', 'Next, you order the giant meat pie, a satiny, suet-butter crust that envelops musky duck confit dressed in tarragon sauce. This is all topped with a few lobes of foie gras. It is a fine middle finger to seasonality, though you might ask yourself what this $52 dish does that The Breslin’s Michelin-starred $11 beef shin and Stilton pie doesn’t. Answer: nothing. ', 'Finally, you finish things off with a heavily spiced fried apple hand pie, an ode to McDonald’s until you dip your fork in the caramel sauce, which is laced with a livery dose of foie gras. ', 'I don’t have too much to say about The Beatrice’s most expensive plates. I’m not inclined to critique a bevy of dishes that so few will experience. But for what it’s worth, here’s a quick meditation on two splurges. ', 'First, Market Price Dover sole is a preparation involves about ten ounces of fish drenched in butter, surrounded by ten or so crab claws — that deliver an oceanic tang so intense it’s almost tannic — garnished with 43 grams of Kaluga caviar.', 'Take note that this isn’t a true Dover sole imported from the U.K. since it’s caught off the coast of Long Island. The flesh lacks the sole’s hallmark firm, springy, this-is-an-edible-luxury mouthfeel. The texture is flakier and more like flounder. Another thing: The Kaluga caviar lacks the intense richness and lingering finish of superior Osetra, or Baeeri varieties. Now is it still an insanely delicious dish? Of course it is. But as a technical expression of classic luxury, it falls short, which is tough when the price is $135.', 'A more compelling choice is the flaming duck. The bird is dry aged for two weeks, cured for five more days, cold smoked, roasted in the oven and then flambeed tableside. Sometimes the skin is gently crunchy. Sometimes it shatters like glass. Sometimes it’s uniformly flabby. The layer of fat underneath has just a touch of give, while the meat is a medium-rare expression of sweet cherry smoke. Surrounding the bird is a riot of cherries, their sugars tamed by savory pan juices. Cost: $102.', 'I’m guessing that’s a lower price tag than the sake-marinated wagyu Mar tells me she’s working on. I’ll ask my wealthy friends how it tastes and report back. Perhaps it’s all appropriate: The Beatrice has transformed from a bastion of social exclusivity into a financial one. That’s the story of New York right there.', 'Ryan Sutton is Eater NY’s restaurant critic. See his other reviews in the archive.', 'Cost: If all you want is a burger and a smoked Manhattan you can get in and out for $76 after tax and tip (which strikes me as a lot); a standard meal will run about $150-$175 per person; those who order MP items will spend more.', 'Sample dishes: Yellowtail with porcini and truffle preserves, lamb tartare with black truffle, savory plum tart for two, Dover sole a la meuniere, milk-braised pork shoulder, cote de boeuf with crustacean butter, whiskey steak, fried apple pie.']"
108,"[""Under the subway tracks at the border of Bushwick and Bed-Stuy, there's Neapolitan pizza that holds its own"", 'Brooklyn’s most meteoric restaurant success in the last decade was Roberta’s. Starting out as a modest pizzeria with a wood-burning oven in an obscure corner of Bushwick, it swelled into an empire. Who can fault other rustic Naples-style pizzerias for trying to duplicate that success? Since Roberta’s founding in 2008, copycats have appeared in gentrifying Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods: Saraghina in Bed-Stuy (2009), Barboncino in Crown Heights (2011), Houdini Kitchen Laboratory in Ridgewood (2013), and Union Pizza Works in Bushwick (2014). Now a new one has sprung up, spinning tasty wood-fired pies.', 'Santa Panza materialized at the end of 2016 on a remote stretch of Broadway on the Bushwick/Bed-Stuy border, where subway tracks clatter noisily overhead, blotting out the sky. Not long ago the neighborhood mainly hosted 99 cent stores and second-hand appliance refurbishers, trailing ranges and refrigerators along the sidewalk. Now there’s a new hotel across the street, hipster bars in the immediate vicinity, and a fast-casual café nearby specializing in bao sandwiches. The three owners — Pietro Hebel, Giovanni Gelfini, and Clement Chabernaud — cut their eyeteeth at Saraghina and Union Pizza Works.', 'In fact, the interior of Santa Panza (""holy belly"") will remind you of Saraghina: A serpentine layout with improvised furniture and whitewashed wall twists and turns through a barroom, open kitchen, blackened oven defended by a wall of huge tomato cans, and back dining room, culminating in a backyard seating area. The rear dining room proves the most comfortable, pin-drop quiet and decorated with topographic maps of obscure places like Port Taranaki, New Zealand. If you are geographically challenged about your exact location in Bushwick, the maps will confuse you further.', 'The core menu is unambitious, suggesting that maybe Santa Panza is happy to be and remain a pizzeria. Eight pies are available in two sizes: six inches ($7 to $9) and 12 inches ($12 to $16). A little quick math will tell you that the smaller pies cost about 18 cents per square inch, with the bigger ones around 9 cents. Yes, the big pies are twice as good a deal. However, the small pies allow you to try more of them. They also provide a larger proportion of the smoky crust that is the real payoff of these pizzas, which provide a meager quantity of toppings. That’s the aesthetic and it certainly improves profitability.', 'Stippled with char, those crusts are superb, with an ethereal lightness and no yeasty aftertaste. The ones I liked best were the Napoli, pungent with Kalamata olives and anchovies, reminding us how Neapolitans love sharp flavors; and the self-named Santa Panza, which features pungent scamorza cheese in addition to the creamy and mellow buffalo mozzarella that stealthily appears on most pies unannounced on the menu. It also boasts crumbled Italian sausage and sage — making the pie seem more Tuscan than Neapolitan.', 'Come to think of it, the ortolana, featuring roasted vegetables, and the salame picante, are also good choices. The second accomplishes the move of putting soppressata — a dried pork sausage adored by Brooklyn Italian-Americans, many of whom came originally from Apulia — right on a pizza. This is also the restaurant’s meatiest pie.', 'There are a few salads and starters, as well as cheese and charcuterie platters, all perfectly adequate. One menu novelty is the burrata appetizer ($12), which features a large lump of cheese, bread, and slices of ham or salami depending on the cook’s whim, making a nice combination while fulfilling your cheese and charcuterie needs simultaneously. Tasting mildly of smoke, the vegetable apps also make good starters, including one of zucchini in a caper-bearing tomato sauce ($11), and a spinach casserole dabbed with béchamel that does a convincing imitation of a steakhouse side.', 'But you’re actually better off going directly to the specials menu — with a half-dozen choices per evening — for your antipasti. One evening there was a starter of cotecchino, a large-bore pork and pork rind cooked sausage and a powerful garlic bomb, served with miniature lentils on a puck of polenta. Superb! Another time there was a salad that featured oven-roasted fruit, tart and crisp-skinned, though not quite enough of it.', 'Any of the risotto specials are great, too, including one that featured a scoop of chicken-liver mousse on top. But the most appealing special of all, and the best dish I ate at Santa Panza, was a special pizza. It presented thin slices of porchetta — another meat almost never seen on pizza — curling on top, along with pickled artichokes, fontina and mozzarella, and fresh oregano ($16). The special represented the kind of clever and aggressive pie making that characterized Roberta’s in its early days and made me resolve to return to Santa Panza again.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one antipasto, one special main course, one large pie, and a bottle of wine, plus tax but not tip, $90.', 'Sample dishes: Napoli pizza (capers, olives, and anchovies), burrata of the day, roasted beets, risotto alla erbe.', 'What to drink: For a pizzeria, the wine list is well-chosen, but not inexpensive. Classic pizza wine in Italy is a fizzy chilled red like Lambrusco or Gragnano; a Lambrusco better than it needs to be is on the list at Santa Panza ($38). A liter of the house Pinot Grigio ($32) is also a good choice. For a splurge, an excellent $44 bottle of red Ramitello from Molise is available. Draft, bottled, and canned beer can also be had.', 'Bonus tip: Don’t carry this sort of pizza out, order it for delivery, or eat it the next day for breakfast: It’s so much better on the premises hot out of the oven.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including one antipasto, one special main course, one large pie, and a bottle of wine, plus tax but not tip, $90.', 'Sample dishes: Napoli pizza (capers, olives, and anchovies), burrata of the day, roasted beets, risotto alla erbe.', 'What to drink: For a pizzeria, the wine list is well-chosen, but not inexpensive.

109,"['Eater critic Robert Sietsema devours the menu, from frog legs to pho', '\n  For historical reasons, much of the Vietnamese food served in New York City originated in the southern part of the country, specifically in the Mekong Delta southwest of Saigon. First brought here by refugees after the Vietnam War, the fare of that region shows Cambodian and Chinese influences, and showcases meals served over broken rice, as well as beef pho served with a phalanx of sauces and a forest of herbs and sprouts — as if the soup needed a little help. But gradually, over the last few years, restaurants with a northern Vietnamese bent have appeared. Most, like Nightingale 9 and Bunker, have been founded by restaurateurs who have visited Vietnam and become enchanted with its street food.\n  ', 'The latest is Hanoi House. Located just off Tompkins Square on a block with an incredibly diverse array of restaurants, it was opened a few months ago by Sara Leveen and Ben Lowell, who worked previously at Buddakan and Upland. The chef is John Nguyen, who grew up in Orange County, California — one of the country’s hotbeds of Vietnamese cuisine — but has also worked mainly in Stephen Starr restaurants. Hanoi House is small and cramped, decorated with tropical storm shutters, wooden lattice work, and potted foliage that give it a colonial vibe. The layout is mainly barroom, with the best seats in a small raised room at the rear. Sitting there makes you feel like a spy in Graham Greene’s The Quiet American.', 'The beef pho (pho bac, $13) — unlike other phos in town — does away with plates of basil, sprouts, and mint, as well as the jars of vinegar, fish sauce, Sriracha, pickled peppers, and chile oil. But oh! The fragrance that rises up with the steam. There’s a hint of cinnamon, perhaps, and the double allium wallop of scallions and charred onions, but the main thing that tears into your nostrils is beef, beef, and more beef. Instead of multiple beef cuts, beef balls, and offal, there are only two things bobbing in its depths: filet mignon and brisket.', ""On the side you'll find pickled garlic and chiles, which you should dump in the bowl, and a spicy and garlicky house-made sauce, which ought to be reserved as a dip for the filet and brisket. Two other add-in options are available at additional cost: oxtail and marrow bone. Skip the marrow, which only takes up space, but by all means have some oxtail. The stringy and fatty meat serves as a contrast to other cuts."", 'Occasionally, pho ga is offered, with chicken instead of beef. This, too, is a formidable dish, and one just as popular as pho bac in the outdoor food stalls of the Vietnamese capital. Either soup is the best reason to visit Hanoi House, but there are plenty of others, too, like the bun cha ($21). When it arrives to a table, bun cha seems like a totally random assortment of ingredients, including a small bowl of rice noodles (called ""bun,"" pronounced ""boon""); a reservoir of sweet, thick broth swimming with pork meatballs wrapped in betel leaves, carved veggies, and irregular hunks of pork; a pile of lettuce and herbs; and rows of spring rolls.', 'The spring rolls are fabulous, bumpy and crisp and tasting of crab and pork. (They’re available as an app for $9.) Really, you can eat the bun cha any way you want. One method involves picking up little piles of ingredients with your chopsticks, dipping them in the broth, and then downing them. Another is to treat the bowl of noodles as a staging area, dumping everything, including lettuce and herbs, into it a little at a time.', ""The frog legs are a revelation, which come in what is described as a Cajun rice batter and heaped with pickled garlic and peanuts. They may never replace buffalo chicken wings, but they're meatier than most amphibian appendages."", 'Out of only 15 choices that make up the entire menu, a couple more merit mention. The side of brussels sprouts is salty and sweet and well worth ordering, and the beef stew, an excellent example of French-Vietnamese culinary cooperation, is tasty in a rib-sticking sort of way. (But please, Hanoi House, give us a larger portion of baguette.)', 'The menu runs off the rails with a few dishes that I\'d charitably refer to as over-creative. Read the words ""banh mi"" and you expect an excellent sandwich featuring all sorts of ingredients matched with fresh cilantro and vinegary vegetables. Here, you get three tiny crostini with a schmear of liverwurst and lobes of sea urchin ($18). Enough with the sea urchin already!', 'A vegetable stew with a coconut-milk base tastes dull as dishwater, an essay in mellowness in search of a purpose. And a green papaya salad comes decorated with shredded pig ear that proves too much trouble to chew.']"
110,"['One star for the tucked-away Greenwich Village steakhouse', ""The first time I convinced myself it would be reasonable to consume an American-sized steak after midnight was at Minetta Tavern. The year was 2009 and the earliest available booking was 11 p.m., so we took it. This was mistake number one. We ordered the cote de boeuf. This was mistake number two. It was big. Too big. I don't really remember how it tasted — there’s surely journalistic evidence of my opinion somewhere on the internet — but I can recount, in remarkable detail, the gastrointestinal consequences."", 'I went to bed at 2 a.m. Two hours later, it felt as if a catnip-addled feline was chasing string inside my chest. My organs, burdened with a pound of dry-aged cud, were engaged in the metabolic equivalent of powerlifting. My heart was racing; my body was covered in sweat; and my stomach was lurching. I don’t know what kind of lie I told my employers when I rolled into work at whatever time I did the next day —“I actually didn’t drink that much,” — but I vowed never to consume well-marbled beef at such imprudent hours again.', 'I contemplated that broken promise to myself when, earlier this month, I stumbled out of bed sometime in the afternoon following a midnight steak dinner in Greenwich Village.', 'Four Charles Prime Rib, hidden like a speakeasy in a Charles Street townhouse, is the offending venue. Like any New York steakhouse, overindulgence is the norm here – you will eat too much, drink too much, and spend to much – but what sets Four Charles apart is the following ignominy: You will not, with few exceptions, sit down to eat before 11 p.m. There are just ten tables.', ""Brendan Sodikoff — the Chicago restaurateur behind Gilt Bar, Bavette's, and Au Cheval, the late-night spot heralded for serving some of the country's best burgers — has arrived in New York, and his chief export is expensive exclusivity. Replicas of the Au Cheval burgers are on the menu at Four Charles, but the star of the show is the prime rib, a single order of which can cost about as much as a Michelin-starred tasting menu."", 'On a good night, the prime rib can be stellar. It’s roasted for twelve hours, which means some poor bloke apparently shows up at 6 a.m. to start the ovens. By 6 p.m., cooks start cleaving off slabs of beef. Waiters in tuxedos then serve them to well-heeled patrons drinking $19 mezcal old fashioneds. The meat practically glows; its crimson hues could qualify as bioluminescent in this inky, jazz-filled room. Heady carafes of jus accompany each cut, lending the presentation a carnivorous perfume. Watching someone tear into the flesh evokes the gastro-athleticism of Kobayashi. Four Charles is a beautiful and bloody ballet.', 'But none of this means you should actually eat here.', 'I call up Four Charles for a booking. A voice-recording tells me all seats must be reserved online. I look on Resy and there’s nothing before 11 p.m. and nothing at all for solo diners. I send an email inquiring whether walk-ins are accepted, and I learn, via auto-reply, that walk-ins have a best shot after 10:00 p.m. I show up at 10:30 p.m. and ask for a seat at the bar. There is no real bar (This is discussed in the auto-reply, which I should’ve read in full). I wait at a nearby dive bar until Four Charles texts me and seats me around 10:50 p.m.', 'Four Charles is a beautiful and bloody ballet.', 'Reservations are released 30-days out and snagged minutes after their release. Currently, there are no pre-11p.m. bookings for two available for the rest of March or April. A waiter tells me that some nights, walk-ins aren’t accepted at all.', 'I’ve long argued that New York needs more diverse late-night dining. But there’s something distinctly dyspeptic about having almost no other choice but to dine at 11 p.m. This is all the more true when the artery-clogging fare that can leave guests feeling as if they’ve consumed the caloric and alcoholic equivalent of two Thanksgiving dinners in 90 minutes flat.', 'Or let me put it this way: When one of the country’s most heralded operators confines himself to a venue the size of a studio apartment, and when that owner releases most of his tables a month ahead of time — requiring guests to plan for a steakhouse dinner further in advance than for a trans-Atlantic vacation — it’s natural to be skeptical. This style of late-night dining doesn’t so much feel like a supply constraint as it does a manufactured sense of hip inconvenience backed by credit-card cancellation fees.', ' The carbonara is ""too fuckin’ rich,"" a waiter told me, a curious descriptor for a restaurant that specializes in fatty, two-pound cuts of beef.', ""When asked for recommendations, he found an empty chair at a nearby table and sat down in that slouchy way you'd expect from a guy at a bar who's about to issue a minute-long opinion. This turned out to be true, though I can’t quite remember the substance of his remarks. I wasn’t really paying attention; I was simply enjoying how frequently he dropped the f-bomb."", 'Such showmanship is not unexpected in a room of low ceilings, dark-wood paneling, and leather booths evoking Michael Corleone’s barroom from The Godfather II. Everything here is a study in exaggerations both large and small. The art — paintings of old ships and ladies in extravagant hats — looks as if it were raided from a garage sale. The waiters act a bit too casually; they might cuss, dance, or have dinner next to you. As the case may be at any proper steakhouse, dishes are comically big. The Dover sole comes in one size: two pounds. It costs $85.', 'For $25, you’re served two giant breadcrumb-topped cakes, with the flavor of the crustacean’s flesh as monochromatic as its natural color. If someone told me this was actually plant-based crab made by the Impossible Burger guys, I’d believe her. Shrimp scampi is a $24 excuse to dip toasty garlic bread into garlic sauce. You can discard the shrimp which are cooked to the texture of styrofoam.', 'Appetizers, true to steakhouse form, are best when cold or raw. Oysters are clean and perfectly shucked; anything less would be unacceptable for $48 a dozen. And the shrimp cocktail is chock full of sweet crustacean flavor.', ""And the carbonara, which is actually called cacio e pepe carbonara for reasons that are quite frankly unclear, was practically swimming in egg. The server was right. It's too [expletive-omitted] rich."", 'The Four Charles burger is an exact replica of the Au Cheval burger, which I last sampled in 2013. It’s a patty stack, which, at its best, exalts the meat though expert cooking, rather than exorbitant sourcing.', 'Ideally, a chef takes two patties and cook them until they form a salty, char adding a modicum of chew in exchange for a level of concentrated beefiness that sometimes rivals jerky. Shake Shack might be the master of the patty stack.', 'But Four Charles, like Au Cheval, has some work to do. The burger had little noticeable Maillard char, and little in the way of beefiness. It’s a softer crumble than the patties at Shake Shack. And it’s topped with an assertive special sauce, American cheese, and pickles. The lack of char points to inspiration from McDonald’s, a chain that is, like Au Cheval, based out of Illinois, but as an $19 creation that’s only available to most folks in the wee hours, it’s a skip.', 'I could write short essays on the golden fries at any Keith McNally restaurant, or the decadent thrice-fried chips at The Breslin, but going forward, each of those columns would have a marked caveat: The fries at Four Charles are better. Not different, not preferable, but objectively better.', 'They have about as much crispness as a fry can take without turning crunchy, and enough potato-y softness without falling into the steak fry category. What makes these fries worthy of worship is the aroma. Fried in beef tallow, they deliver the heady, concentrated scent of potato and the faintness of beef. They are perfect — all the more so when dunked in garlic aioli.', 'In the words of Nick Solares, my meat expert colleague, a prime rib, at its best, ""embodies all the finest aspects of meat cooking — the heartiness of a stew, the tenderness of a long braise, the bodacious, up-front flavors of steak, and the salty and peppery punch of barbecue.""', 'Though Four Charles offers the pre-sliced, English Cut for $40, a better decision is the Chicago Cut, 16 ounces for $66. What makes this such a compelling study in meat cookery is that both the longissimus dorsi (the interior eye) as well as the spinalis dorsi (the fatty cap) boast the same brilliantly red hue; there are no overcooked grey areas. The eye boasts a musky, irony, tang, while the more flavorful cap pulls apart like Texas brisket. Dunk the eye in jus to let the beefiness skyrocket on a Richter scale. Then slick the cap with horseradish cream to tame the intensity.', ""But during a later visit, that prime rib and the jus were aggressively under-seasoned — a heck of an oversight for a restaurant's signature product. Even more aggravating: Variety comes in portion size, not flavor. All three prime ribs are wet-aged only and as a result, they don’t quite pack the next-level complexity of the same cut at Smith & Wollensky, where it’s sweeter, beefier, funkier, cheaper, and available at prime time for walk-ins at the bar. Something to think about."", ""The chocolate pie with Oreo crust sits in your stomach with the same weight as a prime rib. Lemon meringue, a wedge of overly-sweet curd with a mile high-layer of forgettable meringue, is frequently and improbably sold out. Both cost $18, which makes them pricier than some of the city's best ramen or pizza. Still, they're cheaper than three scoops of fudge-slicked ice cream with candies, a creation that somehow commands $21. Some perspective: That sundae is just a dollar less the veal flank steak at St. Anselm in Williamsburg."", 'The proper dessert is a third cocktail, which, alas, will ultimately make you feel worse when you show up late to work the next day.

112,"['Ryan Sutton reviews the Cosme chef’s foray into all-day dining', 'At Enrique Olvera’s Atla, the second New York restaurant by one of the world’s most famous Mexican chefs, you’re best off dining during the day because it offers one of the city’s most beautiful breakfasts. Consider two dishes: A mash of minted sweet peas arrive on torpedo-shaped masa cakes — making the tlacoyos a stunning visual impersonation of avocado toast — while the actual avocado toast sports such an impossibly polychromatic array of tomatoes you’d swear the kitchen took its inspiration from a bag of Skittles. ', 'Second, the space itself — a long, narrow, Instagram-friendly white plate of a room — begs to be populated in the morning and afternoon, thanks to a wall of Cadillac-sized windows that drench Atla in natural light. The windows overlook one of the city’s more sartorially-inspired stretches of Manhattan: They frame a man in a jean jacket on a longboard skating against traffic on Lafayette. A gentleman in a gray overcoat with a leather weekend bag zooms northward on a hoverboard. A woman hurries down the sidewalk in an oversized sports jacket, a loosened neck tie, and, wait for it, sweatpants. ', 'I take this all in. Then I meditate upon the reality that I’m paying $14 for little more than a bagel schmear’s worth of vegan coconut yogurt.', 'The yogurt is good: whipped to the texture of soft meringue, topped with sweet blueberries, and finished with a drizzle of olive oil. The curd is sour at first, then gives way to a whisper of tropical fruit so gentle it’s more of a memory than a proper aroma. I pair the coconut yogurt with cafe con (vegan coconut) leche, which I recommend over the cafe con cashew milk, a beverage that tastes like Skippy-flavored coffee.', 'Since I’m on a roll I order the coconut oatmeal that also happens to be vegan — a curious name for a dish that doesn’t contain oats. The sustenance of choice here is chia seed, an historic Aztec staple that Americans fell in love with after reading about its health benefits in listicles. Atla soaks it overnight, pours it into a shallow brown bowl, then tosses chia with flax seeds, pumpkin seeds, candied ginger, and cashews. Oatmeal, traditionally, is a nourishing, rib-sticking dish. This chia pudding with delicate notes of cinnamon and vanilla is about as filling as the foam off a cappuccino.', 'I take a photo of the fauxmeal, admiring how the coarse nuts match the blonde notes in the walnut table, though they’d really look just as nice on the long grey marble bar. I post the pic online and am rewarded with moderately successful engagement. For this repast I calculate that I’ll spend close to $40 after tax and tip. ', 'I finish my breakfast and conclude I still need to eat breakfast. ', 'Mexico’s culinary ambassador Enrique Olvera made his New York debut in 2014 with Cosme, a Flatiron destination that, above all, articulates (and charges a premium for) the myriad flavors of corn. It is, without question, one of the country’s most important and distinctive restaurants. I awarded it three stars.', 'His second establishment, the more affordable Atla, opened in March in a NoHo apartment building where rentals start at $12,000 a month. It specializes in the type of West Coast-y superfoods you’d imagine slender people living in these $144,000 a year apartments would post about on social media: nut milks, honeydew tarragon juice, flax seed chilaquiles, kale tamales, egg-white omelets, pico de gallo-topped quinoa salad, and ayocote hummus. Atla isn’t so much of a Cosme-like dinner destination as it is of-the-moment, an unevenly delicious all-day breakfast spot that weaves its Mexican accents into the California dreaming prevalent at spots like Dimes or El Rey. ', 'I don’t typically single out morning meals in my starred reviews because serious chefs don’t typically take breakfast very seriously, if they serve it at all. The conventional line of thinking is that a.m. diners are looking more for standard nourishment than culinary inspiration, which is why restaurants that do serve breakfast rely more heavily on tried-and-true classics than the ambitious repertoire of a Michelin-starred chef. ', 'Breakfast has been changing as ambitious restaurants look for more ways to squeeze profit out of the spaces they pay increasingly high rents for, and — as restaurants like abcV in New York and Sqirl in Los Angeles show — there’s a market for being more creative about morning offerings.', 'Atla is at the front of that change. Eschewing bacon, pancakes, or egg sandwiches, Olvera’s breakfast takes cues not from diner culture with its fill ‘em up mantra but rather modern restaurant culture, letting diners build small tastings of sweet and savory fare. ', 'Atla makes breakfast an all-day affair from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Try walking into most New York restaurants and ordering ranchero eggs at noon on a weekday. At Atla, it’s not a problem as long as you’re willing to put up with overcooked eggs in a bland tomato sauce. The better call are those masa cakes I was telling you about, tlacoyos anointed with spring peas crushed in the style of refried beans. The vegetable laced with mint simultaneously jolts the palate with chlorophyllic sugars and incendiary serranos.', 'In case anyone thinks this breakfast until the late afternoon schedule is designed to buy off night owls like me who don’t typically eat their first meal of the day until 1 p.m., this is where I tell you that Atla also serves its full lunch and dinner menu the second it opens, parallel to breakfast. ', 'Kudos to Olvera along with his James Beard award-winning lieutenant Daniela Soto-Innes, for blurring the lines between what Americans eat in the morning versus the evening. This means anyone can arrive in the early morning and order enchiladas in warming chipotle-laced red salsa, fragrant green tomatillo salsa, and queso blanco. The dish isn’t so much about chicken wrapped in tortillas as it is an excuse to take a spoon and sip perfectly composed salsas with salty cheese.', 'Whether it’s breakfast or dinner, vegetables dominate the menu as has become the norm for 2017. Even in the steak tartare relleno — bits of raw strip loin tucked into a giant poblano with carrots, potatoes, and scallions — the dominant flavors are the vegetal tang of the pepper and the pureed habenero, tomatillo, and pumpkin seeds. The raw cubes of beef round out an ode to chile peppers. Chicken caldo, in turn, serves as a delivery mechanism for a salad’s worth of basil, oregano, and cilantro. And the largest quantity of pork on the menu comes in the humble chicharon guisado, soft blankets of pig skin that serves as sponges for the hot crock of salsa verde they’re stewed in, a dish that was maybe a bit too steamy for a recent 90 degree day.', 'And yet, in light of this stunning showcase of vegetables, herbs, and chiles, Atla’s best dish is somehow the avocado toast, that typically overpriced brunch dish that pales in comparison to the cheaper, tastier, more bespoke versions you can make at home. Soto-Innes turns a thick slice of ciabatta into a veritable vegetarian buffet, smearing it with goat cheese, guacamole, onions, and tomatoes ranging in color from red to green to purple to yellow. It’s a shockingly balanced blend of fat, funk, salt, and acid, with leaves of cilantro and slices of jalapeño that impart verdant fragrance with aggressive heat.', 'New York has a solid track record of sending out-of-town chefs back home with their tails between their legs, so give Enrique Olvera credit; he’s two for two so far. Honestly at this point if he wanted to open a cupcake shop, I’d put money on it.', 'Herb guacamole: Large chunks of well-salted avocados with whole mint and basil leaves. You scoop this up with a single, massive chile-dusted purple tostada, which fully covers the guacamole bowl in the modern, Ignacio Mattos-style of lettuce covering an entire steak. The plating speaks to the primacy of corn in the Olvera pantheon of ingredients. But more practically, this is just a delicious, perfectly executed dip.', 'Mushroom quesadillas: Melted cheese with mushrooms in a tortilla. This trio of humble ingredients is ubiquitous throughout New York, but at Atla, the heady fungi, stretchy cheese, and robust corn reach otherworldly heights. This is a near-perfect dish. ', 'Pambazo sandwich: Two slices of brioche painted in guajillo salsa and fried on the flattop, then stuffed with a lot of lettuce and a little bit of potato and chorizo. It tastes precisely like its component ingredients, which is why you should order one.', 'Fish Milanese: Bland white fish breaded and fried into a one-note torpor. Milanese is practically the official dish of Latin America; Olvera can do better here. ', 'Arctic char tostada: Raw char and capers on a farmer’s cheese-slicked blue corn crisp: because every chef has to kowtow to the New York bagel with lox and cream cheese. This one’s a skip.', 'Farro wheat and quail egg meatballs: A study in bland meat drenched in a cloying salsa and stuffed with overcooked eggs. ', 'Corn tamal: A coarse blend of maize underneath a pile of queso fresco. It’s listed as a dessert but works as well as a cheese course. If the corn husk pudding at Cosme is brilliantly restrained in its sweetness and expression of how corn can boast a vegetal tang, the tamal pushes corn’s savory side to an unwelcome extreme. Skip it.', 'Strawberries and cream: Gelatin of strawberries in a fluffy espuma of cream. Nothing wrong with modernizing a classic; it’s just too bad the stiff berries don’t pack the fragrant bliss and sweetness they do in their original form. This is manipulation gone awry.', 'Sweet potato: The best dessert at Atla is a fork-tender sweet potato drenched in condensed milk. Pair it with a strong mezcal. ', 'Cost: Every dish is under $20; cocktails are $15. ', 'Sample dishes: Split pea tlacoyos, coconut yogurt, chia oatmeal herb guacamole, chicken caldo, pambazo, fish milanese.']"
113,"['It’s the most ambitious opening of the year', 'I will never forget the day Julian Niccolini, the silver-haired owner of the old The Four Seasons in Midtown, personally served me in the landmark Grill Room, the institution that invented the power lunch. ', 'Philip Johnson’s bead curtains sparkled in the sunlight. Rudy Giuliani — who had not yet transformed into a spitfire caricature of himself on cable news shows — was quietly holding court just a few tables away. Niccolini noticed that my companion and I were sharing one bowl of asparagus soup. He offered to split it, removed it from our table, then returned in no time with two bowls of asparagus soup. How kind. A few weeks later I looked at my receipt, and saw that I had been charged for three bowls of asparagus soup. ', 'After tax and tip, I ended up spending around $60. On soup. ', '“There has never been a restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan than the Four Seasons,” New York Times critic Craig Claiborne wrote of the newly opened venue in 1959. The Grill Room, together with the adjoining Pool Room, was the crown jewel in the empire of the legendary Joe Baum, a trendsetting restaurateur who, here in the Seagram building, would seek to convince stateside gastronomes that seasonal American cuisine, buffeted by tableside, a la minute preparations, could command as much respect as fancy French fare.  ', 'By the time I made a series of three visits in 2008, Claiborne’s statement only held true in the sense that there were few other establishments better geared toward shaking down diners in a way that evoked the excess of a capitalist system that was on the verge of its biggest crash since the Great Depression. Niccolini and Alex Von Bidder lost their lease in 2016, the same year the former plead guilty to misdemeanor assault stemming from charges of sexual abuse. That July, The Four Seasons took its final bow. ', 'Nearly a year and $30 million worth of renovations later, The Grill Room has transformed into an energetic and exhilarating chophouse, The Grill, while the adjoining Pool Room, a sedate seafood spot that I’ll review this fall, has become The Pool. Fans of aristocratic continuity take solace: You will still spend a ton of money here. But now, you will eat well.', 'The new operators are Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone — two chefs with a reputation for charging a lot in their immersive, theatrical restaurants — and business partner Jeff Zalaznick, scion of a powerful finance family. The late Baum, one of the original gangstas of dinner-as-show, couldn’t have picked a better trio himself. ', 'If the Grill, in 2008, was a lunchroom for the rich, it has become, in 2017, a four-star a la carte throwback. It shows off a style of meaty midcentury indulgences and warm, avuncular, let me-tell-you-another-story-about-JFK hospitality that, given the means, I’d partake of twice a week or more. A theme restaurant for the wealthy, but one that puts everyone under a spell that they belong here, on this stage, where it’s always 1950s Manhattan, rain or shine.', 'Buffet chefs donning ten-gallon toques arrange chilled crawfish platters made with housemade Old Bay — a sweeter, more New Orleans analogue to shrimp cocktail. In a vast kitchen, cooks braise endives with black truffles while in the dining room, waiters in Tom Ford tuxedos use a $10,000 tableside torture device to crush poultry parts into the base of a sauce whose notes of blood, salt, and cherrywood recalls the juices that collect at the bottom of a cutting board after a good night of hunting. This is ladled over a tangle of yellow egg noodles in a gold rimmed bowl. It is pure luxury. ', ""Despite all the renovations, the space — mahogany panels, curtains that undulate like a perpetual motion machine, and Richard Lippold's bronze rods, hanging above the bar in way that evokes the old Manhattan skyline — looks pretty much the same. It takes cash to stay gorgeous over the decades."", 'Making food that actually tastes good takes even more cash. Earlier in July I dropped by The Grill and ordered a vichyssoise heavily fortified with caviar ($98) and mock turtle soup forged from tripe and chiles ($19)', 'So nearly ten years after I accidentally spent too much on a single soup at The Grill, I ended up spending about $150 after tax and tip on two bowls of soup.', 'Raise a glass to Claiborne; there’s no restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan right now than The Grill. It is a self-referential institution that is almost too perfect for a city perennially obsessed with itself, and perhaps newly obsessed with the past, a city whose choice of red meat is increasingly prime rib, a city whose gastronomes sometimes prefer a $100 a la carte carte dish to an $100 prix-fixe, a city where plush dining rooms are coming back after a decade of stripped-down gastronomy, a city where the locus of dinner-as-theater is moving away from open kitchens and back to the dining room, where, in the case of The Grill, an open flame nearly singes your eyebrows in a tableside display for cherries flambee.', 'The Grill is gastro escapism in these Trumpian times, a restaurant that whisks you back to when JFK was president, to a time when the United States, not Germany or France, was the leader of the free world, to a time when people didn’t really wonder whether California does the best avo toast. Here, vegetables and grains come with butter, cream, and crab. Asparagus, the so-called king of vegetables, isn’t cold-pressed or served raw, but creamed into a soup and served underneath a pastry dome. This gently bitter, gently sweet indulgence is known as Jack’s pie and is named after a certain U.S. president who might’ve sampled it here during a birthday celebration. ', 'The genius of Carbone and Torrisi is that they’re not elevating or refining the overpriced, underwhelming Four Seasons that members of the Momofuku generation largely ignored. They’re reimagining an era of restaurants that came and went before many of us were born, an era many of us associate with fictional, hard-drinking advertising executives, an era when well-heeled patrons, during the apogee of what Henry Luce deemed The American Century, traveled to The Four Seasons to experience a uniquely stateside style of fine dining, one whose internationalist tendencies were more of a hat tip than a kowtow to European traditions.', 'Those patrons, old menus show, would come to sample black cherry soup, calf brains en brioche, ham mousse stuffed into a whole peach, and perhaps most famously, wild mushrooms, which contemporary waiters, in their obligatory tableside speeches, remind you were not in great supply until the Four Seasons debuted. If that sounds like an overly staged setup for the the mushroom omelet, consider the following: The egg isn’t so much the main event as it is a loose binder for a pack of earthy maitakes, spongy morels, nutty chanterelles, as well as a few slivers of that preserved black truffle. I sampled this dish twice and both times it was like trying wild mushrooms again for the first time. It is spectacular. ', 'Equally spectacular is the caviar vichyssoise. I don’t typically recommend fish roe at restaurants because it’s a pure product play: Chefs open a can of roe and mark it up. At The Grill, a waiter is quick to tell me the Latin name of the roe (baerri). Like any good baerri, it rolls around the palate like a marble until a flick of the tongue crushes it into an intense and lingering maritime oil. It is the flavor of Osetra times ten, until a clean shot of potato and leek soup cleanses the palate for more. ', 'That’s $100 soup I’d splurge for again. ', 'If caviar that costs as much as a one-way Acela ticket still seems a bit too, well, European, I can recommend with no less fervor the Amish hamsteak, a supermarket staple of my youth that generally constituted an iridescent slice of precooked pork slathered in maple syrup. It was awesome. The Grill’s version is more awesome. ', 'The kitchen takes a fat slice of heritage pork, injects it with ham brine, cooks it, smokes it, slathers it in pineapple glaze, caramelizes it in the hearth, and fans out the slices on a gold-rimmed plate with slices of pickled pineapple. At one level, the dish is magical because of its elevation of an old suburban supper. But even if you’ve never tried hamsteak, a dish found on about zero New York restaurant menus, it still works because of the execution; the silky fattiness, gentle smoke, distinct sweetness, and electric acidity simultaneously qualifies it as the city’s best pork chop and a remarkable act of Mid-Atlantic cooking translated into haute barbecue by way of an extraordinarily fancy restaurant in New York. ', 'That hamsteak, as it turns out, is from an old Four Seasons menu, one from 1964 that I came across online. There’s something energizing in knowing that a preparation, or at least a version on it, is what somebody’s wealthy grandparents might’ve sampled, once upon a time.', 'The same perhaps could be said about a few other items from that old menu, available now: Like cherrystones in pepper vinaigrette served as lightly poached littlenecks in housemade tabasco. Or lamb steak in “susu curry,” reborn as three chops doused in a light turmeric-cumin curry and a dense mint jelly.', 'And the “heart of the prime rib,” from those Lyndon Johnson days, is a wet-aged juicy cut, minus the prized deckle. That’s a disappointment at first, until the kitchen brings a deviled bone, a thin layer of soft, intensely beefy flesh rolled in Montreal-style seasoning that you pick up and eat: No more disappointment.', 'It would be easy to dismiss all this as plagiarism of the past, but I like to think of it as akin to the work of Quentin Tarantino, who takes a collective mass of cinematic pulp — from World War II spy flicks to Westerns — lifts the material from its source, and transforms it, sometimes quite minimally, into visual poetry like Inglorious Basterds and Kill Bill II. It is the culinary equivalent of found food, and quite frankly it’s probably twice as delicious if you don’t get bogged down by the references and just eat. ', 'Critics, myself included, almost exclusively award four stars to tasting-menu restaurants for a simple, and quite frankly logical reason: The lack of choice means fewer misses and longer menus allow for the occasional failures inherent in ambitious cooking. But so the story goes that I’ve never had an experience that wasn’t four stars at The Grill.', 'Order crab is the best advice I can give. It can be Dungeness in a lemony Louis salad, the meat hidden among Bibb lettuce leaves. It can be blue crab in gumbo, sporting gentler oceanic aromas. And it plays a breathtaking supporting role in Neptune’s Crown, which is Dover sole fanned into a pinwheel, dressed with a pile of sweet prawns, shredded blue crab, and best of all, a red chowder-style butter sauce that’s a dead ringer for the tomato bread that used to begin the $50 tastings at the old Torrisi, now closed. The single Dover sole, by contrast, costs $89. ', ""A less expensive gem is the Cajun snapper ($37), fragrant with cumin and pepper, as well as what might be the city's best canard ($41): The dry-aged bird is as tender as a filet while the skin exhibits the texture of a campfire toasted marshmallow.  "", 'For dessert, try anything, from a minty, mousse-y grasshopper pie to a banana eclair, to a pile of Jersey peaches garnished with a coconut cream worth the price of your entire dinner, which will likely run somewhere in the ballpark of $400 for two. Claiborne reported that a meal for two would cost $40 in 1959, which sounds like a bargain until you do the inflation math and realize that works out to about $337 in today’s dollars. Dinner here never was cheap, and never will be. ', 'So there you have it. The Grill. It is the city’s only four-star a la carte restaurant. It is the city’s only four-star chophouse. ', 'The Grill is a rebirth of an institution whose most important meal has switched from lunch — the domain of those powerful enough to leave work for a few hours — to dinner, the arena for those of us who actually work at work. It is a museum to modernist design that happens to serve some of Manhattan’s best food. At the moment, this is as close you get can to a perfect New York restaurant. May we all be rich enough to eat here more often. ', 'Cost: Martinis at $18; hors d’oeuvres and appetizers at $15-$36; mains start at $37 and generally hover in the $50s. Prime rib is $65 and Dover sole is as high as $89. A proper meal will run about $200 per person. Here’s a full menu with prices. ', 'Sample dishes: Littleneck cocktail with tabasco peppers, wild mushroom omelet, steak tartare with anchovy, scallop with snail ragu, pasta a la presse, cajun snapper, guinea hen Claiborne, prime rib, grasshopper pie. ', 'Bonus Tip: Skip the lunch burger, a clean-tasting patty on an everything bun that runs $28 alone, or $41 with fries.']"
114,"['Three stars for the Hunan restaurant in Queens', ""Diners often turn to Sichuan to burn their mouths on the mala of peppercorns and chiles, but the truth is that Hunan cuisine is often even hotter. It issues from a province in Central China southeast of Sichuan. Boasting rich agricultural land and scenic beauty, the region is also renowned as the birthplace of Chairman Mao. The cuisine makes much of fresh and pickled chiles, black peppercorns (few Sichuan peppercorns), freshwater fish, dried and smoked meats, as well as the province’s vegetable bounty. While it's true you can now find Sichuan restaurants in every corner of the city, real Hunan is still relatively rare."", 'Now a new and perhaps more exceptional Hunan restaurant has appeared in an obscure corner of Flushing. Wangxianglou (""Down by the Xiang River"") is located on 40th Road in a commercial strip lying below the LIRR tracks, consisting of small variety stores, nail shops, dumpling stalls, and massage parlors — where women wait outside on folding chairs beckoning passers-by upstairs for some bodywork.', 'Like several of the new restaurants on this row — which seems to be creeping upscale — the outside is unprepossessing, almost ramshackle, while the inside is sumptuous. Presaged by red-ribboned bamboo plants and a smiling ceramic lucky cat with a fist raised in greeting, the front room of the restaurant is spare and straight-chaired. But pass through a bottleneck to find an area of comfy booths penned in by black brick walls surmounted by white lattice fences. Bring a crowd, because each booth can accommodate an army.', 'You want hot? Anything featuring fresh green chiles fills the bill. The spicy green pepper with preserved egg ($14.95) comes in a decorative stoneware mortar, featuring steamed fresh chiles, seeds popping out, roughly mashed with darkly translucent hundred-year-old eggs. A wooden pestle protrudes, inviting you to smash the fiery mélange further. Elsewhere on the menu listed as pan-seared green chili peppers, these same green chiles reappear fried with wrinkly skins, treated as if they were common vegetables and not potent seasonings. Watch out, tongue!', ""Even more characteristic of Hunan cuisine is the pickled pepper: slender, finger-shaped chiles in bright red and green hues, preserved in sharp vinegar. The most famous of these dishes is the steamed fish head with chopped chile ($24.95), which immerses a massive carp cranium in buckets of red broth. Though it requires expert and attentive work with chopsticks to extract the morsels of flesh, there’s more than you'd think, especially if you probe deep in the cheeks, forehead, and hanging jowls of the great fish. Find a more accessible use of these pickled chiles — whole rather than chopped — in country-style shredded pork with green chiles."", 'The contrast between bland and fiery is never more apparent in what is perhaps the menu’s most dramatic use of these chiles: homemade tofu ($10.95), listed as Hunan-style steamed tofu. Perfectly aligned slices of soft bean curd collapse on the plate like dominos, laved in a carmine solution and topped with colorful crushed peppers. On either side float two poached eggs, as if guarding the tofu.', ""While eggs with tofu aren't necessarily common on Hunan menus, there are plenty of other tofu-less egg dishes on the menu, including one called hometown fried eggs — which turned out to be roughly scrambled eggs mixed with scallions and a dash of fish sauce — perfect brunch fare. Another, steamed egg with crabs, features whole red crustaceans atop an omelet laked with a thin brown gravy."", 'Alas, Wangxianglou makes less use of dried, smoked, and otherwise preserved meats and vegetables than Hunan Kitchen (where smoked bamboo provides the city’s best vegetarian BBQ), nevertheless there are a few dishes in this category worth considering. One is called by the head-scratching moniker of wind blowing pork ($14.95). Though it suggests a form of precipitation in Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, ""wind blowing"" may be an inspired translation of dehydrated, and thus the dish features dried, flayed, and rehydrated pork belly, tossed with mild chiles and green onions.', 'Ordering dishes with inscrutable names is not a bad approach here. One afternoon, blessed with a large group, we ordered the elegiac-sounding ""A Bowl of Assorted Grains"" ($18.95). Would it be a porridge of quinoa, chia seeds, and oat groats? It arrived in a vessel reminiscent of Roman times, brimming with corn on the cob, sliced taro, Medjool dates, and sesame seeds in a candied glaze. This sweet concoction is apparently a Hunan main-course staple.

And I make fajitas out of the peppers and onions sizzling in wagyu fat. I dip them in an inky mole with chiles that smolder on the palate. It’s all quite fantastic and absurd: The wagyu isn’t a refinement that depends on creativity or advanced technique so much as it’s about having the customer spend more money.', 'Chef Alex Stupak, at a restaurant called Empellon, has transformed an accessible $25 luxury into a dish tailor-made for the financial community.

', 'I hope things work out. For that to happen, Stupak will need to make his tacos taste good. He clearly knows how to do this: Spend $20 at Empellon Taqueria and you’ll encounter remarkably bitter yet balanced brussels sprouts tacos. Spend $5 at Empellon Al Pastor and a waiter will deliver one of the city’s better renditions of spit-roasted pork tacos with pineapple. ', 'At the new Midtown location, the kitchen thinks it’s a good idea to drown an octopus tentacle in savory peanut butter with celery. I’ll politely describe the resulting texture and flavor as oceanic sludge. Rather than show off Oaxacan grasshoppers for their chipotle-like heat or popcorn-esque crunch, the chefs would prefer to make them a nearly inconsequential element in falafel tacos with hummus. Pastrami tacos use both sauerkraut and mustard seed to drown out any remaining flavor in gelatinous corned beef. They cost $22, about as much as the namesake sandwich as Katz’s and precisely one eighth as delicious. ', 'And then there are the tortillas: Once upon a time, Stupak exclusively used a flour variety. They were impossibly thin and slightly underbaked, showing off his massively flavorful fillings.  He then moved onto reasonably impressive corn tortillas, a changeover that served to keep fattier, saltier stuffings in check.

The short rib platter with warm raisins is, I suppose, an acceptably affordable substitute to the wagyu fajitas.

', ""While the idea of munching on sea urchin-topped chilaquiles with an ice cold beer somewhere on the Baja peninsula sounds nice, it's natural to feel suspicious about a New York chef using the addition of uni butter queso and crab to triple the street value of nachos to $30. That's not to say that fajitas or nachos are off-limits in as far as upscaling bar food. But when the expensive versions of a traditionally cheap dish are the only versions, and when those dishes are fueled by ubiquitous luxury ingredients, the menu is more exclusive and less welcoming, especially in these parts of Midtown.

Especially one that’s been Instagrammed as many times as the “avocado” at Empellon. At first glance, it looks like nothing more than a halved fruit over salt. It appears as if Stupak and his pastry chef Justin Binnie have given up and finally joined the club of chefs who insist on charging $14 for superfoods with little manipulation.', '“It’s not a real avocado,” says the server. He’s right: It’s a parfait in disguise, blended with the namesake fruit for richness, and spray painted with an edible black exterior. The flesh is as soft as a ripe avocado, but the flavor is closer to key lime pie. The salt turns out to be a tart, citrus-y ice, and beneath it all is a smear of eucalyptus yogurt, a refreshing middle finger to the spa food this all mimics.', 'Simply put, the dessert is a five-year-old’s dream of what an avocado might taste like, before actually biting into one and realizing it’s oily, fatty, and overrated. The Stupak avocado is pastry as escapism. And it’s delicious. ', 'The late Michel Richard used to call this type of trickery trompe bouche (a play on trompe l’oeil), wherein the creation on the plate appears to be something entirely different until the ingredients hit the tongue. A classic example is WD~50’s old sunny side-up egg, in which the yolk was carrot juice and the white was firmed-up coconut. This whimsical ethos, combined with the chef’s limitless imagination, is part of what makes Empellon feel so vital. Stupak is pursuing a grown-up’s version of that childhood wonderment: He’s making diners experience something new and surprising all over again.', 'Empellon dices pineapple into tiny cubes, slowly roasts it with brown sugar, gels them, and uses cookie cutters to cut slices into the shape of pineapple rings. The product mimics the softness of a canned Dole product but, thanks to careful cooking as well as gobs of brown sugar and chamomile ice cream, it evokes a futuristic tea I didn’t know I wanted.', ""Here’s another sleight of hand: Stupak molds banana into the shape of a butter stick and places it over a seemingly inedible stone. The ice cream boasts the faintly sour taste of a barely underripe fruit. Your fork then slices into the faux-rock –– really an ash-dusted cajeta —that yields a richer, more complex banana flavor. This is impressive because the sweetened goat's milk, alas, contains no banana: It’s infused with jasmine oil, a volatile perfume that mimics the flavor of the fruit. Never has a caramel sundae achieved such avant-garde heights."", 'A trio of mini-concha arrive with the check; it’s enough to make you wonder whether things are finally getting more traditionally Mexican. Then you crack one open and realize the classically bready pastry has been transformed into an airy gougere filled with passionfruit cream.', '""Life is too short for platonic love affairs and savory desserts,"" Josh Ozersky once wrote. Empellon’s dessert masterpieces made me think of an analogous bromide: Life’s too short to leave dessert until after dinner. If it’s acceptable to place saccharine foie gras preparations on the list of appetizers, why can’t a fake avocado with the masterful balance of a German Riesling hold the same importance as main courses? ', ""Or rather, why the heck is a boundary-pusher like Stupak hiding his best offerings on a separate menu that most folks won’t interact with until they’re full? Well, probably because our society, eternally enraptured with sugar and sometimes willing to line up around the block for the city's best sweets, still undervalues dessert.

Last time I was there, in the early aughts, I’d had a fight with my boyfriend and then never went back; something to do with birthdays and bad habits and too much beer. Because at Walzwerk, which pours only Germany’s best, it’s easy to drink too much beer. ', 'Tucked among tire stores and auto-repair shops on an otherwise desolate stretch of South Van Ness Avenue, Walzwerk isn’t the kind of restaurant that gets much foot traffic. Or online traffic.

', 'Honestly, I’d assumed the place had closed, like most out-of-sight, out-of-mind midlist restaurants you never hear of anyone going to anymore. But a quick peek at Yelp revealed it was “Open now.” I rang to see about availability for that night, a Thursday, and heard something rarely uttered by a reservationist in this town: “Just come in anytime,” said a woman with a thick German accent. “Shouldn’t be a problem.” ', 'True enough, around 6:30 p.m., as I pulled open the heavy wooden door — marked with a multilingual metal sign that read, “You are now leaving the American Sector” —  Walzwerk was indeed empty, save for two dudes with steins of  Köstritzer Schwarzbier and plates heaped with enough food for Thanksgiving. ', 'Like the time warp Walzwerk aims to be, it looked just like I remembered: a scattering of sturdy, mismatched tables straight out of a 1950s accountant’s office; vintage cushioned metal chairs, some still scrawled with black Sharpie on their backs; framed albums of 1970s German disco stars; and life-size black-and-white posters of Lenin and Marx presiding over the dining room.', 'Plus, a hodgepodge of vintage tableware pillaged from flea markets over the years by owner Christiane Schmidt, who opened Walzwerk in 1999 with the goal of bringing a true East German restaurant to the Bavarian-heavy Bay Area. “This is one of my favorite plates,” said the smiley, bespectacled expat of a delicate floral pattern as she set down two irresistible appetizers: silky house-cured salmon with horseradish cream and dense “fitness bread” and a trio of lightly crisped potato pancakes with applesauce and chive sour cream. Then there was that herring, which turned out to be a pleasant surprise — pickled matjes in a sweet, lively sauce of sour cream, apples, and onions on a bed of butter lettuce.', 'As the sunlight that had been streaming in through the front windows began to fade, Christiane came around to light the little candle on every table. And more people began to pile in. These people, you could tell, had been here before: a motley crew of a dozen or so bound for the private room in back; a cute couple who beelined to the tiny, four-stool bar; graying parents who sat sipping their chilled German wine while they waited for their son and his girlfriend to arrive. ', 'Rare is the San Franciscan who’d opt to eat heavy German food every week, let alone every month, which makes choosing among entrees especially hard. Pork schnitzel? Smoked pork chop? Bacon-stuffed tri-tip? Really, at Walzwerk, you can’t go wrong. Especially if you go with the jägerschnitzel, an unbreaded pork schnitzel on a bed of spätzle, topped in a rich mushroom cream sauce reminiscent of Campbell’s cream of mushroom soup in the very best way. It’s been on the menu since day one, Christiane said with due pride, and has remained the most frequently ordered dish ever since.  ', 'The schnitzel — be it pork loin or chicken breast — is pretty much perfect. Pounded thin and coated thoroughly with breadcrumbs, it’s fried without tasting greasy and comes with buttery-smooth mashed potatoes — or boiled if you prefer — and a delicate cucumber salad that’s a refreshing counter to the schnitzel’s heft. ', 'The grilled bratwurst, made with veal and pork, might be the best bratwurst in town. It’s so well seasoned and flavorful that it barely needed the accompanying spicy mustard and house-made sauerkraut, both of which (note to Walzwerk) were so good, they should be bottled. ', 'Only the sauerbraten sounded better than it was: fat slices of beef marinated in a thick, sweet sauce strewn with golden raisins and paired with a duo of matzo-ball-sized mushroom bread dumplings that were dry and disappointing. The red cabbage it came with, however, had a subtle spice and was so delightful, we ordered an extra side. Same with the spätzle, light and eggy, gently browned little lumps that deserved an unadulterated bowl of its own.', 'There are a handful of other German spots in San Francisco, more popular German spots where every night is Oktoberfest, complete with groups guzzling from Das Boot.

We’d prefer to keep our Tartines to ourselves rather than watch them rise around the country.', 'When a talented chef deigns to expand beyond the Bay Area, let alone the neighborhood, he (and it is, typically, a “he”) goes from being perceived as scrappy to a sell-out.', 'No one cares if La Boulangeries and The Groves proliferate. People expect them to. But back when duplication veered into Delfina Pizzeria territory, debate ensued. The California Street location was one thing. Once that broccoli rabe pie started cropping up in Palo Alto and Burlingame, with big plans for further expansion, though, I admit I was bummed. Not for Craig Stoll. Hardworking chefs wholly deserve to make money. I was upset by the notion that a beloved local spot could become — god forbid — a chain.', 'This is all a long-winded way of talking about the new Alta, also known as the second Alta, or Alta MSP — as in: Minnesota Street Project, the adjacent airy, white warehouse that opened in 2016 as an economically sustainable space for art galleries and independent artists. Soon, there will be four Altas, including one in Los Angeles. If Daniel Patterson’s newly formed “Alta Group” has its way, there will someday be Altas around the country.', 'I think that’d be a good thing.', 'Not because of the food, per se. It alone is not worth a mad dash down to an otherwise often-desolate stretch of Dogpatch. Rather, I’d welcome an army of Altas because of Patterson, the man leading the charge: a brainy chef morphing into an ambitious businessman who is meticulous and socially conscious and (with the help of ROC United) committed to hiring a diverse group of good people, serving good food made with good ingredients in a sophisticated yet easy-going atmosphere. Patterson hopes it attracts diners who understand that the aged beef strip loin costs $33 (the priciest item on the dinner menu) because he wants to pay the person washing your dishes as well as he pays the one uncorking your wine.', 'Locals loved the first Alta, the mid-Market pioneer that opened a block from Twitter in 2013. (And the sole survivor after a recent rash of nearby closings.) Which is probably why Patterson picked it to multiply. I only ate dinner there twice, a while ago, and both times I left still feeling hungry and like I’d spent too much money for still feeling hungry.', 'The other day, though, after brunch at Alta MSP, I left so stuffed and satisfied that I almost skipped dinner. My fault for over-ordering (job hazard), but I also blame the fried-chicken sandwich, a comically sized slab of succulent thigh meat encased in a crisp, inch-thick cayenne-tinged crust and set on a soft Della Fattoria bun swathed with a fermented chili-based aioli, with housemade pickles and a daikon-jalapeno slaw. It was spicy. It was messy. It was monstrous. And it turned a fine meal into a memorable one.', 'As did a stroll afterward through the galleries next door. Too bad the current Nobuyuki Takahashi show at the Rena Bransten gallery was better than Alta’s desserts. House-made soft-serve was creamy, but served in mounds so massive it got monotonous. One bowl came topped with a skimpy amount of toffee, salted caramel, and dark chocolate; another was served with strawberries on a lemon-poppyseed cake that was dry and dense.', 'Most of chef Matt Brimer’s midday menu, though, offers more elevated takes on standard San Francisco fare. Here, the requisite little gem salad, in a light and zingy green goddess dressing, was scattered with shaved kohlrabi, coils of boquerones, and dried puffs of farro that gave every other forkful a nice subtle crunch.', 'Instead of $8 avocado toast, it’s $11 grilled levain dressed in dandelion-strewn fromage blanc, hunks of peach, and halved almonds — which seemed superfluous and fell off on the way to my mouth anyway. Another slice came topped in an unwieldy tangle of endive that obscured the flavor of the cubes of smoked black cod and horseradish yogurt below. (Come in for weekday breakfast and toast toppings range from butter [$4] to jam [$5] to Gruyere [$8] to Andante fresh cheese with honey [$9].)', 'I went on a weekend, which meant I was able to try the “Bottomless Mimosa Lab,” an inventive, fresh-squeezed spin on the typical headache-inducing gimmick favored by post-college drinkers looking to get lit by noon. Alta has transformed the bottomless mimosa into a more refined, interactive event that kept us entertained at the table like kids with crayons.', 'Presented with two flutes and a bunch of beakers of various shapes and sizes — including 500 milliliters of refillable Wycliff sparkling wine — we were told to mix our own, mad scientist-style. Fresh lime juice with rhubarb simple syrup was a winner, as was the pucker-worthy OJ with peach vermouth and bitters. We never did request more bubbles. Was it worth $40 dollars for two? No. But it was fun.', 'At dinner, drinks — “coolers” and low-ABV cocktails— were the undeniable stars. The sparkling wine-centric concoctions were so appealing and original and invigorating, I didn’t miss the hard stuff (and felt pretty good the next day to boot). After trying a sip of my friend’s bracing house-made ginger beer, I considered skipping booze altogether, but too late: My Cindy Sherman, an on-tap option named after the contemporary photographer shown next door, was already on its way. The slim glass of berry-red rosé mixed with contratto aperitif, tarragon, and garnished with a strawberry and a sprig of mint had a refreshing tartness to it and wasn’t as sweet as it sounds. Still, it didn’t go down quite as well once the deviled eggs — delicious and doused in kimchi and furikake — arrived. (So much furikake it was like the lid fell off the shaker.) ', 'There were a few highlights from the evening meal, like the Brentwood corn, a wildly flavorful stew of summer kernels, sweet Sun Gold tomatoes, and spicy mini padrons mixed with pops of smoked trout roe and salty green wisps of agretti.', 'The unruly pile of brown-rice puffs (also served during the day) is a well-deserved signature item: cooked, then blended rice, dehydrated and fried into imperfectly shaped cracker-thin vehicles for the accompanying avocado, Espelette-flecked puree. It was silky and smooth, but came in a ramekin too small to match the number of puffs. And they were too brittle to be true dippers, snapping in the dish and forcing us to use our fingers too. Which, even among friends, is a worse offense than double dipping.', 'Alta’s connection to the Minnesota Street Project is both a blessing and a curse. The weekend I went it was packed with young art lovers, with lunching old ladies, with kid-toting couples.', 'But both times I went for dinner, the place — a spare, sleek (if unoriginal) 45-seat space with an inviting, 25-foot-long walnut bar and two matching communal tables — was all but deserted. The restaurant, with its handful of other diners, felt so hushed our rowdy party of four felt something we never do: self-conscious. Plus, peering through the glass wall into the fluorescent-lit gallery, a lone security guard sat at the front desk while outside, a worker power-washed the sidewalk, giving us the feeling that our night was over before it even began.', 'Everything Alta — at least this Alta — does best, it does during the day.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two cocktails, three small plates, two entree-sized plates, and one dessert, including tip — because at Alta tip is included — is around $160. For a hearty, boozy brunch, call it $100. But you can definitely do it cheaper.', 'What to eat: Beignets with powdered sugar and blackberry compote, deviled eggs, brown-rice puffs, fried-chicken sandwich, any salad, Brentwood corn, strozzapreti.', 'What to drink: The Hotel Valentine (Carpano Bianco vermouth, cherry, peppermint, birch); The Cindy Sherman (rosé, strawberry, Contratto aperitif, mint, tarragon); the Bottomless Mimosa Lab; the house-made ginger beer.', 'Bonus tip: Pairing your meal with a walk through the galleries makes for a most lovely urban afternoon.']"

There’s nothing going on at the nearby Nourse Theater, no symphony performing at Davies, no pricey shoe boutiques still open. There’s no reason, really, for anyone to be out and about. And strolling by old-timer Cafe Delle Stelle (plugging free bottles of wine with bills over $60) and newcomer Nightbird, it looks as if, indeed, they’re not. Apparently no one is in the mood for a heady $125 five-course tasting menu.', 'But round the corner to A Mano, and suddenly: crowds, Saturday-night-level crowds, visible through a wall of glass as squeaky clean as the spanking-new condos above. There are people seated at every one of the 90 seats; people crammed into the sliver of a bar sipping Negronis; people spilling onto the sidewalk as a perky host quotes hour-long waits.', 'Everyone, it seems, is in the mood for a $14 bowl of rigatoni.', 'A Mano (Italian for “by hand”) opened in early May with the goal of bringing affordable handmade pasta to a city where mint tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms has tipped toward $22. It aims to be the everylady’s Locanda. Or Cotogna. Or Tosca. Or La Ciccia… The list of San Francisco’s rustic Italian treasures goes on.', 'A Mano is the latest “concept” from prolific restaurateur Adriano Paganini. And it’s a smart concept, if not an entirely new one. Pasta Pomodoro ring a bell? That was Paganini’s idea, too, back in 1994. At its peak, the chain had 40-something outposts, mostly throughout California, the last of which, under new ownership, closed last year. No big loss. It was a cheap, easy place to eat something edible and Italiany. It had no scene and it wasn’t supposed to.', 'But ever since, Paganini has been all about scene, or perhaps the proper word is packaging. In 2008, he turned his attention to pizza and figured out that if he enhanced the ambience and added exceptional cocktails — in a killer location —  he’d be onto something. And he was: Beretta, on a sunny corner of Valencia Street, was an insta-hit, further popularizing the blistered crust-broccolini contorni trend that was already well underway.', 'Starbelly (Castro) and Delarosa (Marina) followed. He then wisely branched out to burgers, hawking humanely raised hamburgers for a reasonable $7.75 at Super Duper, which has 10 locations and counting around the Bay. And now — after adding a Belgian brasserie, tacos, and an Argentine steakhouse to his quiver —  the Milan-born restaurateur has gone back to his roots: pasta.', 'The funny thing is, though, as I slid onto my stool, squeezing into the tightly packed communal table, my first thought was: This place reminds me of Pomodoro, just with sleeker digs and duck-liver mousse. And that was before I’d realized Paganini had anything to do with it.', 'Aesthetically, it’s much cooler than that. The space is airy and oversized, with those floor-to-ceiling glass windows fronting the sidewalk, presumably chosen so passersby can peer in and see how much fun the hipsters are having.', 'Which they are. Filled with awkward first dates and rowdy tables of eight, everyone chatting, laughing, eating affordable food — which flies out of the open kitchen at a fairly rapid clip — A Mano feels like an adult cafeteria with cocktails. Call it a restauteria: a growing breed of eatery where essentially everything costs $16 or less; the kind of place that boasts all the accoutrements of a beloved San Francisco restaurant — but somehow lacks the soul of one.', 'There’s a muted red-white-and-green theme going on (Italy and all); bottles of Aperol and Campari lining the bar like artwork; track lighting (which they fiddled with throughout each night to get it right); and an especially warm, well-trained staff. Still, emotionally… A Mano feels kind of cold. ', 'And, unfortunately, so did my pasta.', 'Not cold cold, in which case I would’ve just sent it back. More lukewarm, with pockets of varying temperatures, like a lake in summer. The problem, perhaps symptomatic of a slammed kitchen still finding its rhythm, plagued not just one pasta, but almost every pasta I had. (The agnolotti dal plin — rich, buttery pillows of pork, roast chicken, and chard — came out piping hot.)', 'The cauliflower bagna cauda was my favorite antipasti, roasted with garlic, lemon, torpedo onions, and chiles. The Monterey squid, too, which came in a tomato-rich stew of chickpeas and romanesco one night, summer corn another. Both were good, albeit not as good as similar iterations elsewhere.', 'There’s always a nightly special, like the Tuscan fried chicken with braised black kale, which was crisp and juicy and, at $20, the most expensive item on the menu. (If you really want to splurge, there’s a $95 bottle of brunello.)', 'The pizza at A Mano is not the focus. (Nor, after trying one topped with asparagus, green garlic, and anchovy, did it seem to me that it should be: the crust was doughy, and the asparagus mushy.) Which is why there are only two or three pizzas per night. And perhaps why, mysteriously, one evening around 7:30 p.m., we watched a delivery guy from Patxi’s, holding a box high above his head, work his way through the throngs to someone in the back.', 'The focus here, per Paganini’s plan, is on pasta. It’s handmade daily with durum, a finer ground semolina flour, under chef Freedom Rains, who cooked at Flour & Water and Incanto before heading the kitchen at Belga. He does seven generously portioned pastas nightly. They change frequently and always with the seasons.', 'Over three separate nights, I tried almost all of them. That agnolotti was the best of the bunch and probably what I’d order if I ever went back. (And I would, if I wanted more of a scene than, say, Souvla, before seeing Pop-Up Magazine or City Arts & Lecture.)', 'The spaghettini, tossed with clams and breadcrumbs, was firm, if dry, but flavorful enough to not render it a total mis-order. But while the pesto tagliatelle with pine nuts, fava beans, and English peas screamed spring — and was clearly made with fresh ingredients — the pasta itself tasted mealy. And the pesto was bland, as if Rains was told to play it safe.', 'Only the campanelle with broccoli di ciccio, a sweet heirloom broccoli, had any kick — and that’s because it was scattered with chile flakes. I actually witnessed more than one table request a side of chile flakes for their pastas mid-meal.', 'It’s what my rigatoni pork sugo needed, too. Like the others, it arrived sort of warm. While hearty, with hunks of braised meat, it lacked the depth and richness of a truly memorable sugo.', 'Therein lies the problem with a place like A Mano — there’s just too much in this town to compare it to. With every bite of my bucatini all’Amatriciana, I kept hoping it would become more like Locanda’s. (It didn’t.)', 'Paganini was quoted last year talking about what drives a successful company. “Why does someone open up one little retail store and somebody else becomes the Gap?” he said.', 'Replace Old Navy with Super Duper and Belga with Banana and, hmm, maybe the Gap with A Mano, and Paganini has, in fact, built the edible version of the fashion empire —one that aims to please everyone without wowing anyone.', 'A Mano’s not going to win San Francisco’s heart, but when the bill comes around, suddenly a so-so sugo becomes a little easier to stomach. ', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two antipasti, two pastas, and a carafe of wine, with tax but not tip, is around $70. If you order a lot, call it $130.', 'What to eat: Tuscan duck-liver mousse, roasted cauliflower, Monterey squid, agnolotti dal plin, campanelle broccoli di ciccio.', 'What to drink: Sirena (vodka, Aperol, grapefruit, Calabrian chile, $12); all-Italian wine list — by the glass, carafe, and bottle; Cynar digestif, which your server may pour as an apology for forgetting one of your pastas.', 'Bonus tip: Put your name in, then head elsewhere for a drink. A Mano’s bar space is too narrow for hanging out.']"

123,"['Cajun/Creole restaurant, Gumbo Bros. on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn is a tiny place with a limited menu, which nowadays is a good idea. The décor channels the French Quarter. Faux gas lamps flank a pair of wooden shutters, the tables are made from bowling-alley wood, and the room is painted scarlet. For folks who like to look at things while they eat, there are antique maps, historic street scenes, football helmets, an engraving of Napoleon, and a record sleeve from the late Cajun comedian and cook Justin Wilson, who once published a recipe for a potato salad made with soda crackers. ', 'New York City has had great luck reproducing many of the world’s cuisines. We now have vast portfolios of restaurants representing Chinese, Indian, and Italian regional cooking, but when it comes to regional American, New York is notably deficient. Sure, there was a fervor for Southwestern in the 80s, and after decades of trying we finally have great Texas barbecues. But our take on the amazing Creole and Cajun cuisine of New Orleans and vicinity has always been disappointing, ever since Paul Prudhomme established a failed outpost of K-Paul’s in SoHo over 25 years ago.', 'But that may be changing. Bushwick’s Tchoup Shop offers wonderful Cajun snacks like boudin balls and okra-thickened duck gumbo in the honkytonk barroom setting of Heavy Woods. More recently, Sugar Freak opened in Astoria, a vast brunch mill that seemed all about beer and mixed drinks. How could the food be good? Well it is, with a stunning oyster po’ boy, as well as such classics as jambalaya, fried catfish, and crawfish etouffee. ', 'Apart from sides and snacks, the bill of fare at Gumbo Bros. consists exclusively of po’ boy sandwiches and gumbos. These gumbos are not the okra-thickened ones. Instead the three on the menu are thickened with a dark roux — an amalgam of fat and flour that must be slow cooked in a skillet to achieve the desired shade of brownness.', 'The sausage and chicken version (cup $6.50, bowl $12) is the best, sprinkled with chopped green onions with a heap of rice at its center. The sausage is fiery andouille, the chicken in shreds, and the flavor every bit as strong as the chicken and sausage gumbos I recently slurped in southeastern Texas and Louisiana. But the rendition called Nanny’s seafood gumbo proves mildly disappointing, deploying the tiniest of shrimp and little of the advertised blue crab.', 'The third one I tried, a vegetarian version called gumbo z’herbs, was much better. The recipe was traditionally associated with Good Friday, when no meat, chicken, or fish could be consumed by the religiously observant. Fresh herbs and greens deliver the brilliant color and the effect is winningly pungent. ', 'The po’ boys are equally delectable, starting with somewhat squishy white-bread rolls, which are just like those encountered in the Big Easy. Crustier rolls wouldn’t work with a po’ boy because the fillings would shoot out the sides. The sad news is that there’s no oyster po’ boy available, but the owners — two LSU grads — deserve credit for that: They don’t have the wherewithal to keep fresh oysters and shuck ‘em on demand, so they skip the oyster po’ boy entirely.', 'Instead the flagship of the pirogue po’ boy fleet is roast beef ($12), made with a Black Angus chuck long braised and sluiced with a funky sauce known as “debris gravy.” This is a real New Orleans thing consisting of pan drippings and scrapings; one bite will make you fall in love with the sandwich. The same gravy is available over rice for $4. If you miss the oyster po’ boy, the catfish po’ boy is every bit as memorable, made with several filets freshly fried with a coarse and crunchy breading, and doused with a spicy remoulade sauce — mainly mayo. Dill pickle chips complete the ensemble.', 'Actually, you can profitably make a meal of sides alone ($4 to $6), which might include the crawfish-stoked mac and cheese (a frequent special), red beans and rice, and fried green tomatoes, which are just as expertly fried as the catfish. Sometimes, Gumbo Bros. offers specials such as jambalaya and shrimp etouffee, but these are often not as good as the regular menu offerings. So stick with the subs, stews, and sides.', 'Cost: Dinner for two with two apps, one po’ boy, one big bowl of gumbo, and two beers, with tax but not tip (the place is self-service), $50', 'Sample dishes: Roast beef po’ boy with debris gravy, fried green tomatoes, chicken and sausage gumbo', 'What to Drink: Gumbo Bros. labored in its early months with no alcohol license, but finally it arrived and draft Abita beer from Covington, Lousiana, is now available in five styles.', 'Bonus Tips: Vegetarians will find plenty to love at Gumbo Bros., including a fried green tomato po’ boy, mustardy Cajun potato salad, and the luscious gumbo z’herbs.']"

Airplane food this is not. ', 'It’s the kind of sushi experience San Francisco has long lacked: one that’s neither austere nor Ace Wasabi. Where going out for serious fish doesn’t have to mean a boring menu, bright lights, and brisk service and an unpretentious, dimly lit, sexy scene doesn’t have to mean sake bombs and monster-sized, cream cheese-stuffed maki rolls named after aging rock stars.

', 'But compared to other top omakase spots in the city, the procession of dishes is a solid value, especially when it includes a velvety A5 Wagyu, gently seared, and streaked with Half Moon Bay-cultivated wasabi (that’s been grated on shark skin, by the way), then showered with frozen foie gras “snow.” As well as a bowl of hand-pulled chilled sesame noodles blanketed with Australian black truffles. And uni. Lots of uni. Premium stuff, plucked off coasts everywhere, from Santa Barbara to Baja to Chile, to yes, Hokkaido.', 'Plus, it’s cheaper than therapy, which is also what my two tableside evenings at Robin brought to mind. In his calm, caring way, our sushi server felt more like our sushi therapist. He leaned in, stared into our eyes, and asked the hard questions: Do we prefer fatty and rich? Or lean and clean? What don’t we like? How do we feel about raw meat? And above all: Are we even uni fans? ', 'I am. My friend was not. “Oh, Adam converts people,” he warned. (Not her: even the creamy, dreamy uni-topped wagyu tartare on a crisp, toasted nori chip with Asian pear, failed to win her affection.)', 'Adam, as in Adam Tortosa, Robin’s chef-owner who cut his toro in LA under Katsuya Uechi. (And keeps a framed, signed letter from him in the loo to let you know.) He spent the last two years honing his skills at Akiko (which is now my second favorite sushi place).', 'Robin’s sushi bar — a wide, beautiful slab of slate set just above the wood bar, so diners can watch the four-man team slicing and molding, tweezing and torching — is unlike most sushi bars of its kind. Most obviously because it’s run by a white guy. ', 'One who looks like a younger, blonder Seinfeld’s Cosmo Kramer. And who has the utmost respect for Japanese tradition. He just isn’t wedded to it, as evidenced by his ingredients on display: hunks of fresh peaches; purees of Granny Smith apples; a tray of house-made potato chips; plastic containers of tomato confit and charred salsas; a lab-like line-up of squeeze bottles filled with ponzu and aged soy alongside heretical horseradish-based sauces. (“Why don’t sushi chefs use horseradish?” he pondered aloud. “It’s like America’s wasabi and no one touches it!”)', 'Also baffling to Tortosa: sushi chefs’ reliance on fish from Japan. “I don’t know why people don’t use the fish off our coast,” he said, slicing us the buttery-smooth belly of an albacore caught this morning on its way up to Canada. “I mean, it’s right fucking here!” ', 'He laid a sliver of local fig across a steelhead from a sustainable trout farm up in Lassen. He spooned a serving of smoked white sturgeon caviar from Sacramento onto a ramp aioli-dipped house-made potato chip. He painted a fat, creamy slab of uni, from Fort Bragg, with a sticky-sweet, sunny-yellow shiro dashi-emulsified egg yolk that, together, tasted like I’d just dove into the ocean on a hot summer day. I wanted to do it again.', 'And on a beautiful Matsukawa starry flounder from Japan, he placed a pinch of grapefruit and a single shred of opal basil. Somehow, its slight spice belonged — with the mild, firm fish, and the tart citrus, and the sweet ponzu — as if basil has been a sushi staple for centuries. ', 'The unlikely herb was at home atop a New Zealand king salmon, too, which was almost as red as its sweet tomato confit and layered with a silky whipped tofu. ', 'In a way that’s not tacky or tasteless but subtle and seamless — and respectful of his painstakingly sourced product — Tortosa manages to combine improbable flavors and textures to make each nigiri something more than just a piece of fish. ', 'Every dish was a work of art, worthy of the ceramic vessel it was served in. Each piece is handmade in Richmond by Jered’s Pottery (aka the new Heath). Apart from the pinch-pot chopstick rests that looked like my kids could’ve made them, it was impressive to see how much effort went into matching tableware to ocean fare.', 'A smooth bone-colored bowl was ringed in the same soft yellow hue as the diced galia melon with magochi sashimi, its delicate flavor enlivened by thin slices of Serrano. I especially loved the smooth, palm-sized bath my ‘onsen Jidori egg’ came in. A single egg cooked sous vide to a pudding-like consistency when swirled, popping with trout roe and chives and floating alongside meaty strips of maitake in a rich, dashi-soy broth. We slurped the broth, somewhat awkwardly, with wooden spoons that were a little too deep, like shrunken versions of the ladles worshippers use to wash their hands before entering a Shinto shrine.', 'Really, the only let downs came toward the end of each night. Once, I opted to finish with an albacore and grilled onion hand roll. It wilted into something resembling a flattened tube of tuna toothpaste and became chewy to the point of almost choky. I tried to “eat it before the nori melts,” like our sushi therapist advised, but apparently I couldn’t eat that quickly. ', 'So the next time, I went for a real dessert, the only dessert: soft serve. (I love soft serve. But enough already, San Francisco!) Even if it was made with sake lees from Bayview and scattered with pistachios and blueberries, it was bland. Plus, I’d rather drink my sake.', 'Oh, and then there was the bill. Also not a highlight, as it was high, especially for a mellow Monday night. But, like a first class ticket on a transpacific flight, if you’ve got the money . . . it’s most definitely worth the splurge.', 'Cost: After flirting in its first weeks with a la carte, Robin moved to omakase only. Meals start at $79 to $179. “You’ll get full no matter what,” they promise. And it’s true. The price goes up depending on what type of dishes, and how many, you want. With two drinks, tax, and tip, call it $260 per person.', 'What to eat: Whatever they serve you. Magochi flathead, grouper with grapefruit and basil; Uni with egg yolk; sturgeon caviar potato chip with ramp aioli; A5 Wagyu with foie gras snow, Onsen Jidroi egg; toro, of course, too.', 'What to drink: Anything on the beer list, especially the Stillwater extra-dry sake style Saison from gypsy brewer Brian Strumke, which was light and delicious. Although, if you get the apricot-tinged Middle Brow “White Light,” partial proceeds go to Glide church. The $19 glass of “72 Clocks” Daiginjo was lovely, but so was the “Ancient Shrine” shimane Jumani, for six bucks less.', 'Bonus tip: Don’t fret if you don’t get the sushi bar. Sitting at a table at Robin is fun, too.', 'Eater rates restaurants on a scale of zero to four stars, taking into consideration food, atmosphere, service, value, and the context of the restaurant within the larger dining landscape.

This is a restaurant, after all, where there’s just one wine list for the table, but where every single diner is presented with a card listing sixty different Chateau D’Yquem selections priced from $90 to $19,000.', 'On one fine evening, a server in a custom Tom Ford suit — inspired by the one Daniel Craig wore as James Bond, an owner tells me — was reciting the specials, including one of king crab dressed in coconut milk, noting that the crustacean is being offered at market price, which is as logical as announcing that the day’s special soup is soup du jour.  ', 'When pressed, the waiter revealed that the single-serving appetizer — four ounces of meat — runs $95, to which I deadpanned, “that sounds reasonable.” ', 'And the waiter walked away.', '“There has never been a restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan than The Four Seasons,” New York Times critic Craig Claiborne wrote in 1959 —  a line that couldn’t have been more prescient for The Grill in 2017: a raucous four-star chophouse where tuxedoed waiters transport diners back to a mid-century dinner party so wonderfully staged you wonder when the JFK impersonator is going to show up and pose for selfies. ', 'You walk through The Grill to arrive at The Pool: chef Rich Torrisi’s pricier and more sedate maritime spot that occupies the second half of this landmark restaurant complex. It lacks the tongue-in-cheek humor of The Grill. Or the creativity. Or the energy. ', 'The room evokes the sea through a constant sense of motion: the bubbling, marble-clad pool, the slowly spinning Calder mobile that hangs above it, the shimmering curtains. Floating planters accent the walls with notes of green and orange, while cocktails serve as ad hoc decorations, sporting giant slices of watermelon and banana on the rims. Paired with a soundtrack that includes light reggae beats, the ambience evokes a refined Manhattan riff on a nautical dive somewhere in the Caribbean –– though there’s something slightly off about listening to Harry Belafonte croon about Jamaican dock workers while a well-heeled clientele nibbles on Carolina Gold rice for $36. ', 'It’s good rice, infused with the sweetness of Dungeness crab and the heat of jalapeno. But it’s a heck of a price for what’s essentially a side dish. And it’s a heck of a lot better than the $28 venison tartare with oyster sauce, a preparation with a uniform blandness that would make it perfect as a starter in any business-class airline cabin.', 'The Pool’s shortcomings include the food, which is why a more skeptical line from Claiborne’s 1957 review resonates here. The Four Seasons’ approach to American cuisine, he wrote, was “not exquisite, in the sense that la grande cuisine francaise at its superlative best is exquisite.”', 'Perhaps that statement seems silly. Diners don’t visit a Mexican spot and muse upon how it pales in comparison to a thousand dollar French or kaiseki meal. Outstanding New York gastronomy isn’t a comparison of one cuisine over another. It’s a manifestation of great food anywhere anyone can find it.', 'Then you dine at The Pool, with its soft blue carpeting, Zalto wine stems, and polychromatic tomato-strawberry salad, which is gorgeous, but gosh, that salad is like $23 and it doesn’t deliver the same electric perfume as it does at Le Coucou. You sample the striped bass with mole spices, which turns out to be a bland square of fish with zero mole flavor, and you wonder whether you should’ve dined at Le Bernardin.', 'That’s when the Claiborne voice in your head whispers: This isn’t as good as some of the city’s best French or Japanese seafood spots. That voice is right. If the mid-aughts in New York were a watershed moment for luxurious American venues ready to take on the Le’s and La’s of the city, ambitious seafood spots never forged as rabid a following (or as many Michelin stars) as their Continental or Asian-leaning counterparts.', 'The Pool has the star power to change that reality: With its sashimi, carpaccio, harissa, Latin peppers, tropical drinks, lobster, aged steaks, aged duck, underpriced caviar (like a discount on a Hamptons mansion) and overpriced everything else, it comes closer than most in channeling diverse ingredients into an American melting-pot celebration of the world’s oceans. If only Torrisi were doing his best work here.', 'Bread service, uni toast, Alaskan king crab, Dover sole', 'Take toast, a genre Torrisi mastered at ZZ’s Clam Bar in the Village, where he tops pretzel buns with urchin and mustard oil for an haute riff of ballgame fare. He anoints white bread with trout roe and honey, adding a breathtaking sweetness to counter the salty fish eggs.', 'And yet at The Pool his toasts are about what you’d expect at a chic charity benefit. Uni toast is nothing more than a few dollops of good urchin with apple; two tiny slivers for $23. Tuna toast with harissa, which has the potential to balance silky maritime fats against the heat of chile paste, tastes more like a spoonful of fish slicked with good olive oil.', 'In another dish, Torrisi freezes foie gras terrines and shaves them into the shape of  tulips ($32). The petals, served with fragrant slices of dehydrated orange chips, melt on the tongue like cotton candy before yielding to a citrus crunch — a touch of cognitive dissonance for one of the world’s richest foods. We paired it with a $60 sashimi plate of fresh mackerel, two grades of fatty tuna that dissolved like tissue paper, and raw scallop dressed in maitake oil, a sweet, slippery mollusk with the perfume of a Russian forest. That’s four minute’s worth of amuses right there for $92. ', 'Lobster tail ($29), grilled to a silky medium rare and plated in the shape of vertebrae, simultaneously delivers a delicate smokiness from the binchotan charcoal and a restrained pucker of yuzu. Just as compelling is the entree portion, exuding a more concentrated tang of the sea, perfumed with a hint of coconut and orange. It’s hard to think of a more compelling octopus preparation than Torrisi’s, where the pulpo provides char, gelatin, and firmness, while a sauce of aji dulce sparkles with the fruitiness of an habanero –– yet a tenth of the heat, and far more acidic. These are nuanced, precise preparations. ', 'Then a waiter brings over a whole grilled madai snapper ($88). It is neither nuanced nor precise, but rather two fillets on a plate, burnished skin over white flesh, an explosive study in smoke and mildly overcooked fish. Match that with a nutty, heady strip steak that’s better than the same cut at all but a few of the city’s steakhouses, and you have yourself a stellar $140 surf-and-turf. ', 'But still, few of the dishes here excite the way that Torrisi did in the late aughts when he elevated the humble Manhattan chowder to fine-dining status — and charged just $50 for the tasting.  ', 'One of the drawbacks about The Pool not being prix-fixe is that some might miss out on Stephanie Prida’s outstanding desserts: a Manresa alum who provides the only reliably four-star experience.', 'She layers coconut cream with grapefruit mousse into little aromatic bricks. She fills the narrow end of a ceramic bowl with chocolate custard that shows off the cacao’s mind-bending fruitiness. She turns tangy frozen yogurt into visual art, placing the curvilinear quenelles on a pedestal and stacking them vertically as if to mimic the futurism of a Zaha Hadid’s High Line apartment complex.', 'If The Grill gets around the yet-another-chophouse quandary through mining the past for historical food, The Pool needs to perform with greater fish fluency to keep pace with its French and Japanese competition.

It was decorated with bright plastic flowers, and he set it down on our table with a flourish. He opened the cage door and inside were nearly a dozen pork ribs neatly stacked. But these were not just any pork ribs: Each was compressed inside a sausage casing, giving them an eerily smooth and shiny appearance. The flesh was smoky and delicately flavored with cumin.', 'Sichuan food — or at least a pallid version of it — has been around New York at least since the 60s, when it achieved popularity on the Upper West Side and in Chinatown. The late 90s saw a resurgence of interest, with peppercorn-laden dishes that were spicier and altogether closer to those served in the Sichuan province in southwestern China. Chains like Wu Liang Ye and Grand Sichuan broadcast the cuisine throughout Midtown to Greenwich Village and even all the way to Bay Ridge.', '\n    Related\n  ', 'Now a new phase in the development of Sichuan food is underway. New, more expensive places catering mainly to Chinese customers are popping up in Flushing.

Related to a 35-year-old restaurant in Chengdu according to our hostess, it recently opened on the second floor of the New World Mall near the Flushing subway station.

Dozens of tables fill a central dining area, the chair backs printed with blue birds. The staff is eager, though not polished. A look at its Yelp will show that it’s filled with complaints — but DaXi is currently producing some of the city’s best Sichuan food.', 'The dish described above is called Tibetan-style pork rib ($23.99). It reminds us that Tibetan expats have been streaming into Sichuan province for decades, but did they bring this dish with them? A search suggests they merely inspired it, because Tibetan ribs in a birdcage seems like pure invention, of course. Other surprises include a bright orange congee made with millet instead of the usual rice. Slices of fresh sea cucumber float on top. Never seen fresh sea cucumber before? Neither had I.', 'Many of the dishes in the six entrée sections — with one outlier price that runs as high as $168.99 for a stir-fried tiger grouper — have visual gimmicks. The old favorite of kung pao shrimp, here rendered more austere than usual, features jumbo, perfectly cooked shrimp coated with a semi-sweet soy sauce tumbling out of a box of fried rice paper with a few raw cashews scattered on top. Evoking a Chinese carryout container, the box is technically edible, but I’d advise against it.', 'The cold appetizer of peeled and crushed cucumbers gobbed with garlic has become a standard in modern Chinese restaurants. But what is the best part of the cuke when it comes to crunch? To answer that question, DaXi reconfigures the dish as curling cucumber skins and calls it “crispy cucumber roll” ($7.99). ', 'Ultimately, many judge Sichuan food by its hotness and gravitate toward orders that elicit the numbing endorphin rush provided by multiple forms of spiciness —sometimes all in one dish: red chile oil, dried red chiles, fresh green chiles, and perhaps best of all, Sichuan peppercorns.', 'One of the best and hottest dishes on DaXi’s menu goes by the wordy name of house special sliced fish in hot chile oil ($29.99). The very appearance of what’s inside the broad white bowl may cause you to gasp: Swatches of white fish glint among a vast flotilla of dried red chiles, among which bob whole Sichuan peppercorns. Be careful, because the fish is a little bony.', 'Ultimately, some of the greatest pleasures of DaXi are the simplest and cheapest. House special rice and cured meat in the country style ($12.99) is a crock filled with rice dotted with all sorts of meat and fat tidbits, and I could have happily eaten it as my entire meal. More surprising is corn pancake in Chengdu countryside style, which turns out to be clods of steamed cornbread with a wonderfully musty flavor, perhaps owing to the cornhusks in which they come wrapped. Can we call them Chinese tamales?', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two apps, a vegetable or soup, two entrees, and two beers, plus tax but not tip, $100', 'Sample dishes: Sliced fish in hot chile oil, crispy cucumber roll, Tibetan pork ribs in a bird cage, steamed fatty beef and tofu ', 'What to Drink: Tea and tap water are free; several beers are available ', 'Bonus Tip: The dishes at DaXi, especially the entrees, tend to be larger than at other Chinese restaurants, so bring a group and order fewer dishes than you might otherwise.']"
127,"['Four stars for 108 Food Dried Hot Pot', 'Broadway from 100th to 116th Streets in Upper Manhattan may be poised to become a hotbed of northern Chinese and Korean eats. It started with a series of carts parked by the Columbia University entrance gates, vending spicy noodles, pork-filled dumplings, bao sandwiches, and kimchee-laden stews to students and faculty who demanded modern East Asian fare, but couldn’t find it elsewhere in the area. Gradually, brick-and-mortar establishments have appeared in the blocks south of the campus, in a neighborhood sandwiched between the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights.', 'One example was Lava Kitchen at 101st and Broadway, a brightly lit spot specializing in dumplings, bing, garlicky vegetable appetizers, and noodle bowls with a range of hotness — and, believe me, the hottest was really, really hot. The latest newcomer is 108 Food Dried Hot Pot, a boxy corner storefront at 108th Street that had been an Irish bar. It offers the city’s latest Chinese food fad: the dry hot pot, a craze renowned for its spiciness that began in Beijing and first appeared here in Flushing food courts.', 'Dry hot pot is different than regular hot pot in that a standard hot pot involves cooking at the table by swishing morsels of food in a bubbling broth. Dry hot pot uses many of the same raw materials, but they’re cooked in the kitchen as opposed to at the table. This hot pot is not a soup but a stir-fry and the finished product glistens with oil, not “dry” in the least. The communal enjoyment on the part of the diners and a similar roster of ingredients is what unites the two types of hot pot. ', 'Here’s how it works at 108: You step up to a lavish display of raw ingredients deposited in metal tubs at the rear of the restaurant. An attendant with a sense of humor, her baseball cap turned askew, will assemble the ingredients you point to, putting the meat, poultry, and fish in one metal bowl ($10.99 per pound), and the vegetable matter in another ($9.99 per pound).', 'She brings these to a weigh station by the register and you are then asked to specify a level of hotness: non-spicy, spicy, medium spicy, or very spicy. (The heat comes from a combo of chili oil, dried chiles, and Sichuan peppercorns.) The ingredients are whisked away, stir-fried with scallions and ginger, only to reappear cooked, at which point your number is called, and you pick up the order. Hopefully, you will find a table in the interim if you didn’t snag one already, and your friends will be sitting there, chopsticks at the ready.', 'Picking ingredients from the 48 tubs is somewhat bewildering: Will you try pig ear, fish balls, gluten, seaweed knots, or chicken gizzards? Certainly, napa cabbage, squid, rice cake, bok choy, and shrimp are go-tos for some. I’d avoid the thin-shaved beef, which looks good raw but completely falls apart when cooked. A pink and salty Spam-like ham was a surprise favorite and so were the baby sausages. Fish proves superb and enoki mushrooms get too soggy, while the wadded tofu skin retains its texture. Ultimately, pick what looks good: three or four ingredients for each person sharing the hot pot.', 'One rice bowl is furnished for each diner. If you can keep your hot pot ordering on the meager side, there’s a whole other menu available that’s printed on paper, not posted, and lists mainly Sichuan and Cantonese fare, as if 108 Food were secretly a neighborhood Chinese carryout. If the apps seems more expensive than you might expect, know that the servings are humongous. The northern Chinese standard of cracked cucumbers ($9.95) with garlic sauce is improved with peanuts and cilantro and is like a species of heroin.', 'Ox intestine and sliced beef ($12.95) and spicy beef tendon — the connective tissue in the cow’s ankle — arrive in razor-thin slices for easy mastication and both dishes slide down the throat on a wave of chile oil. There are also plenty of large-format entrées in a Sichuan/Northern Chinese vein. Though hot and spicy shrimp ($18.99) is the most expensive item on the paper menu, it’s well worth the cost. Enjoy old-fashioned Cantonese? Pork and egg chow mein provides a heap of well-slicked, flavorsome noodles with a fried egg on top.', 'In fact, I’d put the food quality at 108 Food up against that of any Chinese restaurant in town at a similar price. And its location is a boon, because not only is it more convenient than Flushing for Columbia students and professors, but for many others as well.', 'Cost: Dry hot pot for four will average $10 to $15 per person with tax. No service, but if you leave the table a mess, be sure to drop an extra couple of dollars on the table.', 'Sample dishes: If you don’t go the dry hot pot route, or want to supplement your order, you might try cucumber in sauce, cumin lamb, spicy beef tendon, or fish filet with dried pepper from the paper menu.', 'What to Drink: A bubble tea concession called Teatime is represented at a separate counter, with all sorts of tea- and fruit-based beverages, but a plastic samovar at the side of the room delivers plain tap water. No beer available, nor can you carry it in, alas.']"
128,"['You could spend a week eating nothing but kibbeh at Le Sajj. This Brooklyn stalwart — open 11 years — is an anchor of the neighborhood’s Lebanese community, providing a bit of Beirut in Bay Ridge. In the evenings, the front of the restaurant swings open to ocean breezes. Local residents promenade outside or relax on benches provided on every block, as the sun sinks over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge.', 'Inside, one wall displays an antique carved sideboard decorated with beveled mirrors and Tiffany lampshades — this unusual bit of baroque furniture is supplemented by pictures of Beirut, including one of women making the paper-thin pitas that are one of the cuisine’s signatures. A small bar occupies a niche at the rear. Next to it stands a communal table favored by customers who take puffs on a hookah between bites.', 'At Le Sajj, kibbe takes several fundamental forms. One is an orb-shaped fritter with a cracked wheat crust ($7) stuffed with ground beef, onions, and pine nuts. A vegetarian version features a submarine-shaped shell of pumpkin filled with spinach and chickpeas. Less common is the pie form of kibbe ($17) — the same meat mixture with a coffee-colored crust, from which wedges are cut and the aroma of cinnamon rises.', 'Three other variations on raw beef ($12 each) include habrah nayeh, the most interesting option, showcasing beef smashed into a paste, and planted with a sprig of mint. Coarse ground and mixed with bulgur, kibbe nayeh is the classic, while kafta nayeh is a simple version of onion-laced ground beef. All three can be sampled for $34.', 'To the outsider, the lure of Le Sajj’s lengthy menu is not to re-experience the greatest hits of Lebanese cuisine, but to explore its many hidden treasures. There’s a wonderful shish barak, a good honest bowl of meat-stuffed dumplings, something like Turkish manti only smaller and firmer. The dumplings rest in a yogurt sauce that sends them into creamy orbit. Roast baby lamb is another gem, though the name is misleading: The entree consists of pulled lamb leg shaped like a fez and topped with pine nuts in a light gravy. It proves a definition of ovine mellowness.', 'Little half-moon pies, sambusik are stuffed with shallot-laced lamb with a lovely braided spine, while fattoush is a green salad dressed with lemon juice and sharp olive oil, topped with fried pita fragments that give the salad lightness and crunch. Perhaps best of all is hommos Beiruty ($7.50), which rhymes with tutti frutti. While good hummus with diverse toppings has become commonplace at establishments like Dizengoff, this spectacular version mixes in minced vegetables and pickles to produce a hybrid salad and dip — with a flavor that owes something to buttery mashed potatoes.', 'If the eggplant special is available — grab it. The rice-filled vegetable arrives with warm grape leaves on the side, which are a treat in themselves. The menu’s regular offering of stuffed zucchini can be substituted, but isn’t quite as scrumptious. A potato casserole called Lebanese shepherd’s pie is also worth seeking out.', 'Yes, the standards are available, too, including foul mdamas (pronounced “fool”), spinach pies, and a range of flame-grilled kebabs. The lamb chops are small and delicate, with the extra flavor we’ve come to expect from halal lamb, but why not go for all of the kebabs on the Sajj combination deluxe ($34)? It grandly presents two chops, marinated chicken, kafta (little hamburger patties), and a shish kebab on a king-size bed of nicely oiled rice. Alongside come charred yellow peppers and tomatoes, a bowl of the mouth-singeing garlic dip called toum, and — here’s the kicker — one of the restaurant’s paper-thin pitas softened with tomato sauce and heaped with parsley and onions. ', 'Do with that pita what you will — the platter makes an excellent full-course meal for two.

Currently, there are several reds and whites of interest from Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, priced around $9 per glass, $40 per bottle.', 'Bonus Tip: To avoid the scent of the hookah, but also to enjoy the maritime breezes, pick a table in the front of the restaurant.

Two canvases of colorless, textured scribbles echo the white brick walls on which they're mounted. Hardwoods zigzag across the floor in a herringbone pattern. Translucent fabric chandeliers cast a shivery mauve light. This place could be the great room in the home of a wealthy art dealer, or it might be a Bond villain's lair."", 'Tonight, the front-of-house staff outnumber the guests.

Servers hurry these plates from the far end of the dining room, out of a kitchen so striking in its steely brightness that it looks medical in form and function. The master surgeon, German-born chef Günter Seeger, bends over pans on the stove, his mop of curly brown-gray hair falling over his forehead while his cooks stand close, observing and assisting.', ""Occasionally, Seeger moves to stand, unsmiling, at the edge of the kitchen, as he monitors the crew's every movement, the guests' every bite.

Seeger arrived in Atlanta in 1985 to lead the kitchen at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, turning the hotel\'s restaurant into an accolade magnet. He was the first chef in the city to win a James Beard award, and he earned the Dining Room its five Mobil stars. He essentially put Atlanta on the national dining map.

Seeger's closed in 2007, after a decade in which the chef defined haute gastronomy for Atlanta, but also divided its dining community. Devotees rhapsodized over his studied, Old-World-meets-New-World creations — tomato gelee and sorbet with horseradish snow, foie gras bonbons covered in pecans, loup de mer with almond mousse."", ""But Seeger also had a famously stern demeanor that came through in his work; detractors recoiled at the room's chilly austerity, the stiffness of the service, and the experience's lofty prices. I understood those objections, and sometimes cringed myself at the chef's rigid brand of hospitality, but I could never deny the brilliance of his meticulous approach to cooking, his obsession with clarity of flavor and his unexpected juxtapositions of ingredients."", ""Seeger moved to New York after his Atlanta restaurant closed, and proceeded to consult for international grocery chains. In a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, he admitted to feeling that the Southern city where he made his name didn't have enough disciples of haute cuisine to support his uncompromising vision. He spoke of aiming for the day when he would cook in Manhattan, where he might be truly appreciated."", ""Of course, during Seeger's nine years away from the professional stove the world of tasting-menu restaurants changed irrevocably in New York (and everywhere). Per Se slid. Modern tasting menu game-changers like Momofuku Ko, Semilla, and The Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare upset the old guard with casual counter seating in the dining room and high-low riffs from the kitchen that show off individuality and experimentation."", ""Seeger's cooking has always been distinctive, but he also hews to a disappearing sense of luxury: sumptuous trappings, flavors that lean more to the sublime than the edgy. I can't imagine that changing. At sixty-seven years old, Seeger is not a Madonna-style reinventionist; he's more in the vein of Joni Mitchell — a nonconformist. He has a history of remaining true to his lofty vision, no matter the praise or rebuffs that follow."", ""Years ago, I had a couple of lonely meals at Seeger's Atlanta restaurant, dinners eaten while I was on food critic duty, when I would find myself among only a handful of other customers on a Tuesday night. So the quiet room I encounter during my first meal at Günter Seeger NY feels awkward and tense, but also surprisingly familiar, almost nostalgic. I've been waiting almost a decade to eat Seeger's cooking again — and I find plenty in my meal that makes it worth the wait — though I didn't expect culinary history to repeat itself in quite this way. I'm guessing Seeger didn't, either."", 'Chestnut soup (left); Gunter Seeger at work in his kitchen', ""Seeger set a dauntingly high price for his New York debut. At first the nine-course tasting menus, booked ahead of time through restaurant-ticketing startup Tock, cost $185 per person with tip. Over the past five months, after some disappointing reviews (including two stars from Pete Wells in the New York Times), Seeger dropped the pre-paid tickets altogether and tinkered with the restaurant's format. Just in the past weeks, he's started serving $95 four-course menus, with choices for each course, as well as a ten-course set menu for $148."", ""In September, a few weeks before the four-course option would become available, I experienced a ten-courser with a few friends. The meal began with cherry tomatoes from Campo Rosso Farms, a vendor at the Union Square Greenmarket who grows out in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The tomatoes arrive still on the vine, along with bowls of anchovy cream — a stripped-down interpretation of bagna cauda. I enjoy this as a kick-off snack, the fresh pop of the fruit against the briny twang of the fish. My friends shrug. It's a little too no-big-deal for them. I laugh to myself. One dish in and we're fully returned to Seeger's domain, the opinions around his food as polarized as ever."", ""Here's the highlight over which we all rave: roasted black sea bass sidled up to a tuft of wilted Malabar spinach. Underneath is a sauce of pureed sea urchin and truffle juice. Cardamom-infused honey drizzled over the fish slowly runs into the sauce below; it teases out the sweetness of the urchin and equalizes the truffle's pheromone funk. Masterful. I love Seeger's linkage of choosing Malabar spinach, a green that proliferates in South India, in the same setup where he uses cardamom (which thrives in the same region) to such wizardly effect."", 'The course that preceded the fish was one of Seeger\'s Atlanta staples: an egg custard, served in an egg shell barely cracked at its crown, flavored with maple cream and scattered with bottarga. In this context it slyly foreshadowed the sea bass dish\'s musings on sweet and oceanic flavors. But what comes after the sea bass shifts our course entirely. Rounds of beef tenderloin have been poached in a mixture of red wine, port wine, and Madeira; they come with a sauce made from the poaching liquid and some blanched haricots verts. ""This meat has no texture,"" one of my buddies grouses. ""It\'s a refined take on sauerbraten,"" I respond, referring to the Germanic pot roast. He pauses. ""Okay,"" he says. ""That helps me appreciate it.""', ""Not every course set itself up for such easy defense. Earlier, two oysters arrived nicely zinged with apple and ginger, but also topped with piquant whole chilies that obliterated any taste of the bivalve. And lobes of gently smoked Columbia River salmon paired with baked apple are cooked exactingly, but don't leave much of an impression. In this restaurant era of bold, global bombasts on the plate, subtlety can too often tip into dullness."", ""The pattern of my first meal holds steady at a second, slightly longer meal at the chef's table, which sits perched on the very fringe of the kitchen, underneath an intricate iron chandelier fashioned by Seeger's grandfather. It's a Saturday, and the restaurant is full; the servers are more relaxed, having found their rhythms, and the room feels merrier. Again the German-inflected meat course — this time, venison scented with juniper berry alongside crisp-soft red cabbage — comes through as the dinner's spiritual center. There is smooth chestnut soup with shaved truffles, the essence of autumn, and a wonderful sturgeon mousse bolstered with trout roe and purple potato chips."", ""Pastry chef Emily Hall's raspberry savarin"", ""Would that those spuds could have loaned texture to the utterly mushy beef tartare that came a few courses before. And a broth of matsutake tea with nasturtium leaf is meant, I know, to showcase the mushroom's delicate, slightly spicy earthiness, but the volume on the flavor is turned too low. It needs more overtness, more umami."", ""In this meal, though, I'm also picking up understated allusions to the South in some of Seeger's cooking, echoes of his time in Atlanta — it's heartening that Seeger hasn't entirely eschewed the region that gave him his first flush of success. Okra relish brings vinegary bite to grilled abalone. For the featured cheese in the course that precedes dessert, Seeger often procures from two standout Georgia producers, Sweet Grass Dairy and Many Fold Farm. And the egg custard tart, tingly with nutmeg, is a sweet finale that Edna Lewis would have championed. (Seeger's pastry chef, Emily Hall, is a talent to watch: She also created a terrific raspberry Savarin, like a fruit-accented baba au rhum, that I relished. In an elegant visual move, Hall’s desserts are served on plates decorated with a riot of florals, a subtle contrapunto to the minimalist plateware of Seeger's savory courses.)"", 'And now that he\'s in New York, sometimes the South comes to him. While I\'m sitting at the chef\'s table, I watch a couple approach the chef. ""We flew up from Atlanta!"" the woman says, and then gestures to her companion: ""He\'s 50!"" The man chimes in: ""Well, we had our first fancy-dinner date together at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead."" Seeger gives them a stilted nod and says quietly, ""Did you enjoy your meal?"" What I love about this exchange is that this couple knows who Seeger is, both as a chef and as a character, and obviously don\'t not expect any show of warmth or gregariousness from him. It is enough to eat his food and say a quick hello to their city\'s departed culinary hero.', ""I hope New York will also come to recognize his strengths. The current four-course option on the menu seems right as an introduction, the right price and pace to home in on the German flavors, go for the gamy meats, indulge in some classic luxuries, and savor the comfortable chairs. Günter Seeger NY is, without question, more Le Bernardin than Momofuku Ko. But at a time when cream and classicism may be returning to favor (witness this season's sensation, the Franco-Continental Le Coucou in Soho), Seeger and his subtlety do have a place in the city.

130,"['One star for this salteña-slinging kiosk in the Columbus Circle subway station food hall', ""The food court, once a scrappy lunchtime hangout, has of late metamorphosed into a legitimate culinary destination, a wi-fi wonderland where you hack away on a MacBook while your companion queues up for a $19 lobster roll. It's also called a food hall now, and it is, at its best, a democratizing force. Not only does its structure provides a more affordable way for restaurants to test out their ideas than does a brick-and-mortar location, but it also allows open-palated gastronomes to construct an eclectic meal by traversing only the length of a small shopping mall, instead of a large swath of the city, roaming from poke spot to toast joint without fear of death by vehicular traffic."", ""Still, the modern food hall, whose labyrinthine layout can evoke a Vegas casino (all the better to keep you inside!), can with all its curation and preciousness sometimes feel better suited for those who view food as only an intellectual and creative pursuit, rather than those who view food as fuel to keep their bodies chugging along. This brings us to Turnstyle, a food hall improbably located in the Columbus Circle subway station, which entirely avoids that. Its purpose feels a touch more utilitarian: to feed you quickly, deliciously, and affordably —\x80\x94 albeit not cheaply — with coffee, cold press juices, pastries, poke (alas), and slices of pizza. This makes a certain sense: A subway station is a place designed to shuffle humans in and out as expeditiously as possible, which it does through incentives both positive (the trains are faster than taxis) and negative (it's a sauna in the summer)."", 'A subway station, in other words, is literally the opposite of a destination. And yet, despite the liminal space that Turnstyle occupies —\x80\x94 complete with a lack of sufficient air conditioning —\x80\x94 there is one single awesome venue within it that manages to make this food hall a culinary draw in and of itself.', ""Welcome to the Bolivian Llama Party, a plywood kiosk that sells, with fairly little hoopla, the oft-overlooked wares of one of South America's poorest countries. Meet the salteña, a pastry whose braided vertebrae impart it with the look of a Nerf football. Unlike its thinner-skinned cousin, the empanada, the salteña, is filled with jigote: a chicken, pork, or beef soup the density of Campbell's Chunky. Like a soup dumpling, you bite off the tip and suck out the insides. (I wouldn't be the first person to compare it to a xiaolong bao, and I won't be the last: among other things, both the Chinese and Bolivian snacks rely on gelatin to keep their brothy interiors in a solid state before cooking, ensuring against any starchy sogginess.) Be warned that with more sauce comes more responsibility: the chin-dribbling repercussions are, if the pastry is consumed incorrectly, disastrous."", ""Bolivianos take their salteñas in the morning, and Llama Party, accordingly, opens up at 7:30 a.m. Those who prefer to eat more sugary fare in the early hours will appreciate the markedly sweet taste of the outer shell, far sweeter than a classic American pie crust, and a handsomely yellow hue thanks to the use of aji amarillo peppers. Hold the pastry vertically, and nibble in from the top corner until you strike liquid, about a third of the way down. At this point you could take a spoon and finish off the insides. Don't — you're not eating clam chowder out of a Panera bread bowl. Slowly sip the salteña from the side and treat it like the doughy chalice that it is. When the fragrant liquid is extinguished, pour in a bit of llajua —\x80\x94 Bolivian cilantro chile sauce —\x80\x94 to spice the remaining meat and hard-boiled eggs with a fragrant, stinging high."", 'The chicken salteña (left); the Oropeza brothers, wearing llama masks', ""Brothers Alex, Patrick, and David Oropeza, whose parents hail from Cochacamba, a lakeside town in landlocked Bolivia, started selling their salteñas in 2012 at Smorgasburg, and have since popped up as seasonal operations on the Rockaway Boardwalk and at the Williamsburg club Output. Their Turnstyle location, open since April, is the siblings' first permanent endeavor, and arguably the highest-profile Bolivian spot in Manhattan."", ""BLP, as the restaurant often calls itself, does not not sell alcohol. It does not have table service because, well, there are no tables, nor are there seats. The ceiling is painted mustard yellow (French's, not dijon, topped with doodles of break-dancing salteñas), and the restaurant's official mascot, which hangs on the wall, is a llama mask that's somehow a dead ringer for the evil rabbit in Donnie Darko. Cayenne-spiked fries and a brisket-heart hamburger laced with oregano and smoked salt were the stars at the Oropeza brothers' seasonal locations, but not at BLP, so I won't tease you with them. At BLP, you'll have to make do with the chola sandwich, but this is not a bad thing."", ""BLP's chola, a reinterpretation of the classic Bolivian pork sandwich, is a swine three way: musky braised shoulder with burnt ends, house cured bacon deeply perfumed with smoke, and sticky chicharron softened by the warmth of all the other ingredients. The sandwich, laced with garlicky mayo (to amplify the richness) and pickled carrots (to cut through the same), packs all the porcine grandeur of Momofuku Ssäm Bar's $250 bo ssäm into a hand-held, $12 package. A brisket sandwich, with the same accoutrements, boasts none of the promised smoke flavor, which is just as well as the dish is rather a study in the concentrated flavor of beef. Eating this salty masterpiece is akin to dining on a short rib sandwich slathered in pan drippings."", ""It's easy to dismiss BLP as yet another fast casual venue peddling quinoa salad. But that grain makes sense here — the caviar of the starch world (such cute little spheres), is a chief export of Bolivia. The dark story behind the stuff, of course, is that the worldwide demand for the high-protein, grain-like seed has driven monocropping throughout the Andes, and demand-driven price increases abroad have made the traditional foodstuff unaffordable to many Bolivianos. With that in mind, you can skip BLP's quinoa salad, with its mix of greens, cherries, and walnuts. Quinoa nachos, drizzled with spicy homemade cheese sauce, don't pack half the sweet, sundrenched flavor of the superior corn-chip variety; they're also more expensive. An order with a scoop of pork costs $14 before tax."", ""But you can't avoid quinoa entirely: It makes an appearance in the majestic vegetarian salteña, whose pastry shell holds an incendiary stew of smoky-spicy aji panka, funky oyster mushrooms, and yes, soft quinoa.

131,"[""Eater’s senior critic awards three stars to Flushing's oldest Sichuan restaurant"", 'According to The Insiders Guide to Chinese Restaurants in New York by William Clifford, our first Sichuan restaurant appeared in Chinatown around 1970. Located at 23 Chatham Square, Szechuan Taste — the name reflected the old-fashioned transliteration of ""Sichuan""— served a sophisticated take on a cuisine that had recently caused a sensation in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. Clifford mentions that the chef had worked in Taipei for famed landscape painter Chang Ta-chien (who inspired his own Sichuan dish), and the chef’s repertoire in Chinatown included tea-smoked duck flavored with camphor, hot braised live carp, and sliced pork sautéed with fish flavor.', 'During the ensuing decade more Sichuan restaurants popped up in Chinatown, but less predictably, the Upper West Side became a hotbed of the fiery cuisine at places like Szechuan and Szechuan Royal — with the hotness toned down and an emphasis on such tamer recipes as noodles with sesame sauce and baby shrimp, Szechuan-style. It was this blander version of the cuisine, and one lacking Sichuan peppercorns, which were then technically illegal in the US, that eventually worked its way onto the menus of nearly every neighborhood Chinese restaurant in the city.', 'Meanwhile, perhaps inspired directly by the cuisine’s popularity back in Taiwan, Sichuan restaurants began opening in Flushing, where Taiwanese immigrants were just beginning to settle. There are now at least eight Sichuan restaurants in the neighborhood by my count, plus nearly a dozen stalls that offer it in Flushing’s sprawling food courts. The oldest restaurant is Szechuan House, founded in 1985 (it has cycled through a few names under the same ownership over the years). Located on the same block of seedy looking commercial buildings where Little Pepper was to get its start in 2005, at the time it was surrounded by massage parlors and gambling dens.', 'Now the block has become more upscale, featuring a glitzy new food court. The restaurant itself welcomes customers with wine bottles in the front window, well-spaced furniture, and a huge painting of pink roses on the wall. While the menu may not seem as wild or comprehensive as that of many of its younger counterparts, Szechuan House offers a well-polished version of the cuisine utilizing superior ingredients, with a level of presentation and service that verges on the elegant.', 'The classic dishes are all in evidence. The playfully nicknamed ""ants on a log"" — here called ""clear noodles with meat spicy sauce"" ($9.95), and paradoxically included in the Vegetables section — is a morass of clear mung-bean threads in a thick soup tasting pungently of fermented bean paste, reminding us how fermentation has become a fad in modern culinary praxis. The name comes from the fact that, if you squint your eyes, the finely ground pork looks like insects clinging to the noodles.', 'Tea-smoked duck is cooked until the dark carmine flesh achieves a pastrami-like texture, while ""spicy slice beef and tendon"" ($7.95), heavily glossed with chile oil, has a few frilly pieces of honeycomb tripe thrown in to vary the terrain. Few Sichuan restaurants in town do whole fish as well as Szechuan House. The champion swimmer is a Szechuan-style whole tilapia ($19.95), a bargain two-pounder (my estimate) that comes smothered in ground meat and festooned with red peppers and cilantro, not quite as spicy as some other examples around town.', 'You want hot? The spiciest thing my guests and I tortured ourselves with was ""slice fish with peppercorn,"" which featured a dozen or so small filets poached in red oil and heaped with crushed Sichuan peppercorns, leaving your mouth feeling like you’ve been chewing on a live electrical wire.

Though not the most thin-skinned in town, the Sichuan wontons in hot oil were freshly made, and well-stuffed with pork.', 'Demonstrating the influence of other regional cuisines and Taiwanese in particular, some interesting non-Sichuan dishes have worked their way onto the restaurant’s menu in the last 30 years. One is wasabi arctic surf clams ($9.95), which sounds like a band formed by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Undoubtedly inspired originally by Japanese cuisine, the red-flanged sea creature is coated in thick green horseradish sauce, which climbs right up your nose.

I bring this up because during my visits to the rose- and saffron-scented Indian Accent in Midtown, waiters would often regale me with sometimes overly obvious preprandial pedantries before I was allowed to eat. Here’s what I was told: That New Delhi is the capital of India (thank you). That kofta is also known as a meatball (really). And that a particular ingredient, I believe it was garam masala, is an ""Indian word,"" a remark that almost led me to rhetorically ask which of the subcontinent’s 150 languages he was referring to. I could go on.Pete Wells referred to this phenomenon as ""waitsplaining"" in his review of this expensive restaurant in Le Parker Meridien Hotel, and in my visits, which all occurred after his, that policy was still in full effect.', 'None of this is to say that a good story doesn’t have its place at a restaurant. In our eye-rolling era of experiential eating and destination dining, chefs look to the spoken and written word to differentiate their wares from those of their bloodthirsty competitors on the annual World’s 50 Best list. And there’s something particularly pleasant about sitting inside the famed manure shed at Blue Hill at Stone Barns while the wait captain literally points out how the latent heat of compost is sous-viding your next course, because the visual imagery is right there, and because poop usually merits an explanation when it’s involved in a $1,000 meal.', 'But at Indian Accent, when you’re halfway into a $9 pastrami kulcha in a hotel on 56th Street and the manager swings by to talk about how Patna-born chef Manish Mehrotra was so overwhelmed by his first visit to Katz’s that he just had to honor it with a dish on the menu, you want him to take it down a notch.', ""Let's instead focus on the more important story: Why this spinoff of a New Delhi restaurant, with its foie gras, black truffles, and other globally inspired luxuries, is an absolutely vital addition to the Midtown dining scene and cocktail circuit."", 'Keema, the rustic lamb and pea (or goat brain) stew that’s often served on a bun — a South Asian sloppy Joe — is haute-ified here, to brilliant effect.

133,"[""Eater's senior critic awards three stars to Brooklyn's new Welsh gastropub"", ""Sunken Hundred is the name of a legendary lost kingdom plunged beneath Cardigan Bay on Wales's rugged western coast. According to an ancient tale, the low-lying land was once defended by a great dyke that kept the waters out. A pair of princes were in charge of the sluice gates, one of whom was a drunkard. When it was his turn to tend the gates one evening, the inebriated prince passed out at low tide leaving them open, and the ocean soon came rushing in, permanently drowning the land. It is said that in times of danger, the ringing of submerged church bells can still be heard. Archeologists who have examined the bottom of the shallow bay have found stones with Roman inscriptions, and artifacts from more recent habitations — meaning that the legend might be true."", 'Sunken Hundred is also the moniker of a new Welsh restaurant on the border of Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. The exterior is blue clapboard with white trim, suggesting a quayside pub, and just inside the front door tables are cozily wedged into a pair of windowed niches; they\'re the best seats in the house. Further inside, one wall holds a striking painting of Cantre\'r Gwaelod (Welsh for ""Sunken Hundred""), showing haunting shapes rising out of a foggy seascape. A line of tables lie along that wall; opposite, a bar dispenses themed cocktails and a limited selection of wines and beers — alas, no Welsh brews, which are difficult to import, as a waitress confided one evening.', ""How does Welsh food differ from English? Well, the overlap is around 80 percent, but Welsh cuisine pays much more attention to seafood of a surprisingly diverse sort. Thanks to the fecund warmth of the Gulf Stream, Welsh waters teem with sea creatures and edible plants. One thing you'll find again and again on Sunken Hundred's menu is seaweed, especially the dried variety known as nori in Japanese and laver in English. Fried into squiggly fritters, it's the free bar snack served warm when you order a happy hour drink."", ""That same laver also figures in two entrees on a menu that's mercifully concise. Seafood cawl ($19) might be called a Celtic bouillabaisse, a thickish broth bobbing with shrimp and squid and a pair of croutons smeared with orange rouille. Stuck to the inside of the bowl is a sheet of nori that may be pulled down with your spoon and sampled every time a little extra flavor is required. In another entrée, a cliff of bone-white hake ($18) rises out of a sea of chunky tomato sauce flavored with butter and seaweed, giving the fish more flavor than it rightfully possesses. But the best main course is ffagodau ($14), a landlubber's delight of lamb and pork meatballs shot with organ meats that give them a liver-y savor, awash in multiple sauces including smooshed minty peas and onion gravy."", ""Sunken Hundred's pasty is the city's most spectacular, the surface dusted with sea salt and a tomato chutney pooled on the side."", 'In line with modern culinary practice, a large majority of the offerings fall into small-dish categories: Bites, Sides, and Shares. Among the Bites find a lamb pasty (pronounced ""pass-tee"") — a pastry that originated in Galicia in northwestern Spain, where it is known as an empanada. From there it was carried by Celts to Cornwall and Wales in what is now the United Kingdom, a vivid reminder of an ancient peripatetic race whose food culture persists. Sunken Hundred\'s pasty is the city\'s most spectacular, the surface dusted with sea salt and a tomato chutney pooled on the side.', ""While it's tempting to call that pasty the best thing on the menu, there have been several other candidates. Poached razor clams ($14), now out of season, featured the elongated shellfish poached, cut in sections, and flavored with charred lemon and lamb jus — proving that, for Welsh cooks, the idea of lamb is never far from their minds. Known as chips, the French fries at Sunken Hundred are also excellent. Even though they appear in the Sides section, one may readily treat them as an app, and a cost-wise one at that ($7). Did I mention that the homemade ketchup is seaweed flavored?"", '[Top: lamb pasties, and seafood cawl. Bottom: pork and lamb meatballs.', ""The dessert list is very short, maybe because the savory fare is so rich, and drink flows freely among the patrons. (Sunken Hundred is foremost a pub, after all.) Yet the desserts tell you as much about Welsh cuisine as any other section of the menu. There's bara brith ($9), a slice of tea cake heavy with candied fruit, fried on a griddle and presented with a scoop of walnut-rum ice cream. Equally good are the Welsh cake sandwiches — saucer-shaped cakes crusted with granulated sugar and accompanied by thick clotted cream and hedgerow jam, made with hard, late-season berries that are only fit for making preserves."", 'And this is where Sunken Hundred leaves you, eating jam distilled from the hedgerows that run along country lanes in Wales. Perhaps reminding you of Led Zeppelin and their Welsh mountainside retreat of Bron-Yr-Aur (""Breast of Gold"") and that ""Stairway to Heaven"" lyric: ""If there\'s a bustle in your hedgerow, don\'t be alarmed now."" It\'s just cottagers picking hips and haws to make hedgerow jam.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, featuring two apps, two mains, and two alcoholic beverages, with tax but not tip, $70.

134,"['Eater’s restaurant critic awards two stars to the new French restaurant from Keith McNally', 'If restaurants serve as temporary escapes from reality, or at least the weather, one wonders why so many New York establishments keep their spaces as dark nightclubs in the dead of winter. That’s not to say gourmands expect banquettes to double as tanning beds, but as the days grow shorter, the ignominy of using an iPhone flashlight to read a cocktail list grows larger. What this city’s owners and operators need to remember is that just as turning up the volume on a playlist isn’t a surefire way of livening up a venue, turning down the lights doesn’t necessarily cast sexier shadows on the patrons. At some point, you just can’t see the person in front of you.', 'Keith McNally, a 65-year-old Englishman who’s been courting high society with roast chickens and other unfussy fare ever since he opened The Odeon in 1980, understands the importance of seeing the person in front of you, as well as the fashion editor across the room. This is what brings us to Augustine, McNally’s French-y foray into the Financial District. The restaurant isn’t just brilliantly lit; it’s a veritable cure for seasonal affective disorder.', 'McNally Gold is the correct term for Augustine’s color scheme, which you’ll also encounter at his other downtown French restaurants, Cherche Midi and Balthazar. This isn’t gold in its Trumpian form, a polished penthouse metal that distorts the face of the onlooker. This is gold as luminescent warmth, a product of faded yellow ceilings, orb-like incandescent lamps, and orange flowers painted on the walls. McNally Gold is a real life Instagram filter, imbuing all of Augustine, from the tile floors to the airy cheese soufflés with a gently-gilded patina. McNally Gold doesn’t quite shimmer as much as it radiates. The aura is such that it offers a clear line of sight from the packed bar up front to the coziest booth in back, and it nourishes all with one of winter’s scarcest luxuries: light.', 'And for those rolling their eyes at such panegyrics, here’s something equally practical for the colder months: When you walk into Augustine’s double-doored ante-room, you’re blasted by two separate heaters, a central one set at 88°F, and a smaller device on the floor at 92°F. It is the foyer of the century, and it makes taking off your coat feel like mainlining a hot toddy.', 'Then you walk in and feast on some of the city’s finest raw and roasted meats.', 'Augustine represents a new culinary benediction of the Financial District, where many of the journalists who cover McNally, myself included, are increasingly being relocated. It also happens to be McNally’s first hotel restaurant, a fact you’ll become acquainted with when searching for the restrooms, accessible via a Judge Dredd-style long walk (through the lobby bar, down a curved staircase, past a private party, and to the left).', ""The food is good. Very good. I can’t think of a single other new beef tartare that has plagued my daydreams the way Augustine’s has. Chefs Daniel Parilla and Shane McBride lace the raw filet with a lethal dose of the hot sauce-slash-citrus perfume known as yuzukosho. I’ll be disappointed the next time I cut into a humble cabbage leaf and find that it’s not stuffed with jiggly foie gras and heady black truffles, like it is at Augustine. And I’ll sigh whenever I sample a warmed oyster that doesn’t have the briny explosion of the ones served here — they're topped with trout roe, and softened with Pernod butter."", 'It’s possible dishes like these attract patrons to Augustine. And it’s possible they don’t. Neither bloggers nor gourmands keep track of ongoing gastronomic developments at McNally spots the way they pounce upon hybrid pastries by Dominique Ansel or squid ink ramen bowls by the latest Japanese chain.', 'When I asked a fellow food writer, a person whose nuanced opinions keep him gainfully employed, what makes McNally restaurants so popular, he responded they’re reasonably effective means to getting lucky in the, ahem, biblical sense. I asked him to elaborate on the nuances of that saucy assertion, and the PG version of his answer boiled down to ""that’s just the way it is."" I replied that the same could be said of any halfway-competent establishment that sells alcohol. And yet, I kind of see his point. With all the well dressed people behaving better than they would at Tao, though in a more raucous fashion than they would at Le Bernardin, it’s easy to see how hanging out at Augustine can promote a sense of benign promiscuity among a certain crowd. Or something like that. And as is the case elsewhere, the alcohol helps.', 'A staffer hands me a blend of whiskey, fig syrup, and Branca Menta. It tastes like a peppermint patty and costs me, after tax and tip, over $20. Three young men at the zinc bar, all wearing hubcap-sized watches, pair their entire meal with aged rums in snifters. Two women try to charm a Parisian bartender by tackling the dizzying linguistic acrobatics involved in ordering a Grey Goose & soda in French. Their voices waver after a few seconds, and they switch to English. The bartender serves me the ""whisky burger,"" a juicy, fall-apart brisket blend topped with Comté and onions. And then he hands me the included side dish: a shot of whiskey.', 'It’s not the type of scene (or beverage pairing) you’d expect at a Danny Meyer joint. If Meyer is the city’s undisputed king of hospitality, McNally is one of its misbehaving princes, always making people happy but never not creating mischief. Last year Meyer penned a thoughtful op-ed for the Times about how high-rents are hurting restaurants. And this year McNally thought it was a good idea to publish this: ""It’s difficult not to be anything but fully supportive of a system that protects employees from harassment. But, remembering what it was like to be in my 20s, I believe it’s also important not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.""', 'Let me continue the comparison: As Meyer has spent the past three decades inventing wholly unique establishments with brand-name chefs, McNally has largely occupied himself with opening up the same restaurant over and over again, doling out infinite iterations of a French all-day brasserie — outliers like the Italian Morandi, the beefy Minetta, and the American Schiller’s notwithstanding. Trying to distinguish among, Pastis (RIP), Balthazar, Cherche, and Augustine is like differentiating the various entrants in the Fast & Furious franchise. Dedicated fans have their favorites, and I suppose they’re all good in their own right, but novices are usually best off making do with the latest entrant and having friends fill them in on what they’ve missed elsewhere.', 'Augustine, true to form, is currently the best of the McNally gang. It’s a fine example of the classic French cooking New Yorkers are falling in love with yet again, and it even equals Minetta in the quality of destination-worthy steak cookery.', 'Leg of lamb is a proper order for any first timer. McBride and Parilla slather the meat in thyme and rosemary, spin it around the rotisserie for an hour, and slice it rare like roast beef. There is nothing surprising or eyebrow raising about this dish. It is spectacular because it is ordinary. It is simply soft lamb with jus over flageolet beans.', 'What is eyebrow raising, however, is the location of the fancy Rotisol-brand rotisserie, which is somewhere in the kitchen. Long before modern American chefs decided it would be ""entertaining"" to have open kitchens, restaurants and even supermarkets treated rotisseries like Ferraris, placing them at the edge of dining rooms so guests could stare off into the distance and watch caramel-colored meat rotate methodically over flames. McNally will have none of those distractions. You come to Augustine to ogle people, not poussin.', 'Tan chicken thigh exhibits all of the markings of a maitre rotisseur — soft flesh, almost the texture of confit, surrounded by skin that’s more pliable than crisp, a carnivorous Fruit Roll-Up. Order it.', 'What you can skip is the seafood and crudité platter. Balthazar, in its heyday, seduced many a young culinarian with its towers of oysters, clams, shrimp, and lobster. Augustine’s $85 version, by contrast, is a forgettable pile of overcooked shrimp, bland lobster, sweet snow crab, neutral mussels, and string beans. Halibut en cocotte is a miss as well; the mealy, overcooked flesh sits in a bowl of under-seasoned black truffle jus. This mistake costs $41.', '[Clockwise from the top: rotisserie chicken, salt-baked oysters, roasted blood oranges, soufflé au fromage]', 'Stick with heartier fare. The foie-gras stuffed cabbage leaf I mentioned earlier is a little gift that accompanies the squab. Stab the bloody breast with your knife and drag it through a lose pâté of the bird’s own liver. Rabbit cassoulet, a copper tin of soft saddle, heady sausage, and white beans buried underneath a carpet of buttery breadcrumbs, won’t win any awards for depth of flavor or execution. But it warms you and feeds you. In this weather, I’ll take it.', 'A note about the steaks: they’re aggressively seasoned, a move that might aggravate haute-carnivores. No, there’s nothing uncommon about crusting an affordable-ish bistro steak with peppercorns. What makes Augustine’s preparation a bit of an outlier, however, is the fact that this is the default style for a $53 Creekstone strip. The $145 porterhouse, in turn, is crusted heavily in Montreal spices: garlic, coriander, cayenne, paprika, dill, and sugar. The result in both cases is profound and mesmerizing. The Stilton-esque odor of the dry-aged beef is clean and clear on the plate, but as you chew, the blue cheese notes form a quieter background note to the pyrotechnic spices, a vibrating bassline for an electric guitar. There are no other steaks I’m more excited about eating in New York than these.', 'I sample the strip at the bar, where a stranger presses herself so closely against me while taking selfies it would’ve qualified as grinding if this were a club. A few minutes later I watch as a man escorts his partner into the bar area for the explicit purpose of mansplaining the concept of Augustine. ""This is a brasserie, a real brasserie,"" he says. I consider ordering the baba au rhum I had a few days back, but I remember it being excessively sweet, so I keep things simpler and ask for some rum. I suppose I could have that same rum elsewhere for less (now you know why critics don’t review Johnnie Walker Blue at every new restaurant). And I suppose I could order a fine roast chicken at my local Gristedes for less than $32. But at this moment in time, I would rather have it at Augustine.', 'Cost: Starters at $14-$23; mains at $29-$45; seafood platter at $85; dry-aged steaks at $53 and $145.', 'Sample dishes: Steak tartare, cheese souffle, leg of lamb, salt-baked oysters, rotisserie chicken, dry-aged strip, porterhouse for two.', 'What to drink: Cocktails, even though they’re $17 each.

It helped set an almost preposterous number of standards for how the country now eats. Other influential restaurants at the time centered their kitchens around the grill, or bought their ingredients directly from farmers, or entwined Italian and Mediterranean dishes among Americana staples. Campanile coalesced these notions of California cuisine under one roof. Soon glories like rosemary-perfumed lamb, fish over whipped potatoes, and luxury versions of ravioli proliferated across the land, as did nostalgic enticements like Campanile's grilled cheese night."", 'Silverton poured her soul into the restaurant\'s side business-cum-juggernaut La Brea Bakery. She upgraded fruit crisps and cobblers by sluicing pears or peaches with vanilla-bean brown butter, and her tangy loaves of sourdough redefined the genre. If today the words ""La Brea"" are as synonymous with bread as they are with tar pits, you can thank Silverton.', ""The couple split in the mid-2000s.

The space retains its\xa0Old Hollywood magnetism.Coming here never feels stale. It’s easily among the top five most beautiful restaurant spaces in LA.  Charlie Chaplin, the story goes, constructed this stone-colored brick building as his office complex in 1929 and then lost it in a divorce settlement to one of his actress-brides. Chait and the Manzkes made some minor tweaks: They expanded the dramatic glass façade at the restaurant's entrance, and in the clamorous front dining room they laid green and white tiles that trick the eye like an Escher print."", 'The restaurant\'s name harkens to the bustling Métro station in the center of Paris. Walter Manzke, a Southern California native, mastered the French canon at high-profile gigs including glittery, defunct Bastide and downtown\'s Church & State. His menu at Republique presents a number of traditional Gallic pleasures: mussels and frites, escargot en croute, an Alsatian tart spread with bacon, raclette, and caramelized onions. But I wouldn\'t label this restaurant as French.At this point hardly anything about the menu conjures ""French:"" It’s a wholly Californian mix of Mediterranean, American, and occasionally Asian flavors.  Intended or not, much of the food also comes straight from the Campanile playbook: flame-kissed proteins, of-the-moment salads, pasta tangled with seafood or filled with earthy purees.

Then tackle a board of house-made charcuterie, spread with a collage of salumi, rustic pâtés, and small crocks of pork rillettes and satiny duck liver mousse topped with diced pickled Asian pear.

A $135 porterhouse sports none of the buttery tenderness of that same cut at Peter Luger — in fact it packs less beefy flavor than the $15 Pathmark version my father fired up on the grill last weekend.', 'Two giant canvases, displaying zoomed in photos of fireworks mid-explosion, hang on the east edge of the dining room, with text in all caps printed over them: ""Sometimes you know it in your head, the chef whispered. Sometimes you feel it in your stomach, she smiled, buzzed."" The doggerel sends me into a reverie, in that it makes me think about how I’d be sternly disciplined by my editors if I ever tried to use ""to smile"" as a verb of speech. Then, more practically, I wonder how to tell my expense account auditor that my louche dining companion actually blew $33 of our bill on Evian still water.', 'It’s tempting to say that Cut New York, bereft of its West Coast glitz, is just another steakhouse, but such reductivism denies the venue an indisputable superlative. It is, by most observable measures, the city’s most expensive steakhouse, a venue where cocktails can cost more than a typical steak, and where steaks can cost more than a typical tasting menu.', 'If the cost surprises you, you’re not alone. None of the online menus, in any of the locations, show prices. There are no wine lists on the website. And if you’re particularly unlucky, you might encounter a drinks list in the restaurant without any prices. When buying a round for four, expect to spend over $110 after tax and tip for potables that range from unbalanced and saccharine to decidedly average and forgettable.', 'Cut isn’t just a steakhouse. It’s an international luxury brand sporting six locations from Asia to the Middle East to London to Las Vegas. The Persian Gulf outpost is nestled in a hotel that’s sort of shaped like the letter H and that, conveniently, sits on its own exclusive island in Bahrain. The Singapore location is housed in the $8 billion Marina Bay edifice famous for a rooftop infinity pool that entitled international types love to Instagram. And Cut in New York, not to be outdone, is on the ground floor of a hotel-residential complex where apartments can run up to $60 million.', '[Steak tartare and the Wagyu selection.]', 'The restaurant’s lofty prices are not completely without merit. One of Cut’s chief selling points is that it is the rare meatery to adopt (some of) the comforts of fine dining. As the cost of beef has turned ribeyes and strips, long a semi-affordable culinary luxury, into a veritable financial hardship, I’ve argued that rough-around-the-edges steakhouses will need to do a bit more to justify $100 plus per person tabs. Puck, accordingly, breaks out the decanters for even cheaper bottles of wine. A single order of chestnut soup is split into three separate bowls. The sound levels and space between tables are closer to a venue like Gabriel Kreuther than, say, Keens. About fifty percent of my meals began with excellent gougeres (I guess they forgot to bring them out the other times). Giant bread baskets, even when the contents are as icy as a martini, provide free carbs. And caramel petits fours accompany the check, even if you don’t order dessert.', 'A devotion to fancy also means appetizers veer from the standard steakhouse shrimp cocktail or iceberg wedge with blue. So the kitchen sends West Coast-style shellfish Louis (crab and lobster slicked with Thousand Island), as well as bibb lettuce drenched in a sweet-sour dressing and stilton — a cloying waste of a salad for $19.', 'There is no Caesar at Cut.', 'DIY pork belly bao come with steamed buns so comically small you can’t actually wrap anything in them. Whole lobsters, no less than two pounds each (when I dined, $63), are drenched in black truffle butter; they taste as fantastic as they sound. And bone marrow comes not as a gelatinous mess but rather as a creamy, veal jus-drenched custard served in a hollowed out bone.', 'I’m half tempted to bestow that marrow with my prestigious Flan of the Year award, were it not for just one thing: That preparation, like virtually every other dish here, is available in a near carbon copy at the other five locations of the restaurant. If a waiter substituted the Singapore menu for the New York one, nothing would make you say, ""wait a minute, wrong part of the world!,"" because Cut isn’t about sense of place. It is about expensive beef and everything that comes with it as a replicable, exportable, global commodity, just like the films of Puck’s beloved Hollywood. It’s a bleak vision of the gastronomic landscape, even more so when you cut into a steak, and realize the restaurant’s chief commodity isn’t worth ordering.', 'An hour or so into Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can, Leonardo DiCaprio’s con man character seduces his mark with the following phrase: ""I’d like to cash this check here and then I’d like to take you out for a steak dinner."" It’s a brilliant line, because unlike, say, duck a l’orange or foie gras, you don’t need to explain a night out at a steakhouse to a general audience. It is a prima facie American indulgence. A steak dinner is never quite affordable, but it’s always approachable, a guaranteed way to spend about as much as you would on a tasting menu but with a third of the courses, none of the tableside speeches, and in half the time. And yet you’ll feel twice as awful afterward, which is precisely the point of such largess.', 'A steakhouse, in other words, is fine dining for everyone (if you can afford it). This is why a culinary novice is more likely to be swindled at one of the city’s myriad mediocre steakhouses than by one of its few chef’s counter tasting venues. And this is why I get a touch angry when I hear waiters actively recommending an $89 steak for one, like they do at Cut.', ""At other restaurants like Roberta's, that steak, an American Wagyu strip from Snake River Farms, is a gorgeously aged and prepared cut of meat. At Cut, the American Wagyu is simply a squishy rectangle of tender, one-note beef, with little notable finish."", '[The bone marrow flan and baked Alaska.]', 'I’m sure there are meat aficionados who think every cut should be aged just to the edge of tasting like a semi-rancid cheese in a varsity locker room. I’m not one of them, but I believe — and I don’t think this is revolutionary — that if Cut is going to serve 16 different cuts, Puck should showcase a variety of different flavors. He doesn’t. Almost every steak here is a study in the same degree of blandness. The steaks lack aromas of beefiness as much as they lack stronger overtones of stilton or offal. They are the bovine equivalents of chicken breast. The only noticeable difference between a dry-aged strip and a wet-aged ribeye is the price tag, and that the latter has more moisture. Only the grass-fed filet justifies its $50 price; the meat packs a gentle, natural acidity that tingles like a good Riesling.', 'Miyazaki Wagyu, typically enjoyed in small quantities due to its obscene richness — imagine a slab of foie gras seasoned with concentrated beef stock — is available, with one exception, at no less than six ounces ($150), which would mean ingesting enough fat to wreck havoc on even the sturdiest digestive systems. That one exception, incidentally, is a two-ounce steak that comes as part of a $125 tasting of New York sirloin. It was, and I mean this as someone who loves Japanese Wagyu, objectively terrible. The morsel, grilled over hardwood and finished under a broiler, is charred so heavily that any subtly beefy flavor is overwhelmed by the carbonized exterior. It is akin to consuming charcoal-covered fat.', 'You finish with an excellent baked Alaska (filled with passionfruit ice cream), but by this point the culinary and financial damage is already done. The irony is heavy: Puck, the chef whose California cooking long ago helped pave the way for the style of healthy-ish dining that New York is excited about in 2016, is now making his big Manhattan debut with a lugubrious chain steakhouse, a follow up to his chain airport restaurant. But at least the pho sandwich is off the menu.', 'Cost: Most appetizers in the $20s; steaks at $45 or higher.', 'Sample dishes: Steak tartare with beef tendon crisps, slow cooked pork belly with comically small bao buns, black truffle lobster, grass-fed filet mignon, pretty much any of the sides, which are all fine. That’s about it.', 'Bonus tip: For better steaks, try most any other good steakhouse in the city, like Minetta Tavern, Keens, or Peter Luger.', 'Cost: Most appetizers in the $20s; steaks at $45 or higher.', 'Sample dishes: Steak tartare with beef tendon crisps, slow cooked pork belly with comically small bao buns, black truffle lobster, grass-fed filet mignon, pretty much any of the sides, which are all fine.

137,"['Captivating cuisine served in a postage-sized restaurant', ""\n  Everything changed for New York's Thai restaurants in 1997. That was the year SriPraPhai in Sunnyside morphed from a bakery into a full-blown restaurant and spicy dishes from the northeastern region of Isan began to burn our tongues — many of us for the first time. Prior to that, restaurants were mainly devoted to the cuisine sometimes known as Royal Thai, heavy on the basil stir-fries and curries made from jarred pastes. The new food — rich in pork and papaya salads, vegetable dips, fish mousses, grilled chicken, and noodles —soon began to invade most Thai menus in town. Eventually, entire restaurants devoted to Isan fare opened, notably Som Tum Der in the East Village and Larb Ubol in Hell’s Kitchen.\n  "", 'Still, Manhattan restaurants aside, the hotbed of Thai food remained central western Queens, host to a robust Thai community,  where an arc of Thai restaurants extend from Elmhurst to Eastern Astoria. This amazing collection— numbering in the dozens — are close to the Buddhist temple, Wat Buddha Thai Thavorn Vanaram, an urban edifice dating to 1995 said to be the largest in the city. Thai restaurants continue to open in close proximity, many the size of postage stamps. What has changed is the widening purview of their menus.', 'The new crop includes\xa0Thai Diva, a remarkable spot with an operatic name on a side street in Sunnyside. The interior is square and compact, with only four tables, but the décor explodes with color. A checkerboard of orange and gray squares spreads across one wall, as a sky-blue coffered ceiling draws the eye upward. With Isan food as the base, the menu draws its inspiration from all regions of Thailand, featuring many dishes rarely seen on Siamese menus.', ""Maybe you don’t know jack about jackfruit. Native to Southeast Asia and India, this football-shaped fruit is similar in appearance to a durian and the largest specimens can be humongous, growing up to three feet long and weighing up to 80 pounds.

When it's green, it's starchy and mellow, like a cross between a potato and a green plantain — perfect for use in rib-sticking curries and salads."", 'Find jackfruit here in the tum kanoon ($9), a shredded salad flavored with a dab of yellow curry paste and lime leaves, which lend an astringent quality. The salad comes with crunchy pork rinds and sliced cucumber. A similar salad utilizes bamboo shoots and depends upon cilantro and green onions for its zesty flavor. Both originated in Chiang Rai, a province in far northern Thailand.', 'Green curry, tum kanoon, beef balls, and mummy shrimp', ""Another remarkable dish from northern Thailand – where the food shows Burmese and Chinese influences — is khanom jeen nam ngaio (see above $11), with a base something like American tomato soup laced with pork, into which an eater adds wads of white rice noodles, bean sprouts, and pickled mustard greens. With a squeeze of lime it's something like a mutant pho. The result is supremely delicious. It seems that every dish at Thai Diva features flavor and texture enhancers on the side, to be added at your discretion."", 'Recipes from the southern Thai peninsula show Malay and Indonesian influences, and the menu notably offers roti canai, an Indian-leaning flatbread with a creamy chicken curry.

138,"[""Eater's restaurant critic visits the two Brooklyn pizzerias from Emily and Matt Hyland"", ""In the mountainous Friuli region of Italy, frico refers to a dish of thinly sliced rinds and shards of Montasio cheese fried into a golden crisp. It is a frugal dish, often made with potatoes or cold polenta, built for surviving winter in the Alps. In the Detroit region of North America, frico refers to the messy, miraculous effect of putting so much mozzarella on deep dish pizza that it spills over the side of the pie and crisps up on the edge of the pan. It is a technique of excess in the land of plenty. And it's exactly what makes the square pies at Emmy Squared in Williamsburg so gosh darn amazing.Motor City pizza has arrived in New York. This is the monster truck of the ambitious pizza world — a weighty pizza for two. On the surface, the style seems familiar: Sicilian-American focaccia-like crust, cut into squares. But the similarities to Sicilian pies (or flatter, crunchier grandma slices) end there."", 'If there’s sauce on the Detroit pie, it sits partially above the cheese, rather than below. This brilliant innovation leaves the mozz under the sauce white and creamy, while the exposed sections turn brown, bubbly, and blistered. And that beautiful frico, a belt of burnt Maillard goodness, surrounds the fringe of the pie like a paper doily surrounds a cake. ', 'Take a bite. The frico yields like blowtorched sugar on crème brûlée. The thick crust is softer at the top, but requires a bit more chew on the pan side thanks to the golden ""underskirt,"" the term that true pizza nerds use for the bottom of the pie. The pie cools further as you bring it home – which you inevitably will because this is the mammoth steak for two of the pizza world. In the box, the oils start to firm up, fully developing a satisfying heft overnight in the refrigerator. For the true cold breakfast pizza enthusiasts, the ricotta and caramelized onion — evoking a proper tarte flambee minus the bacon — is the right pie for icebox aging.', 'Emily Hyland, the co-owner Emmy Squared, is not from Detroit. The poet and vinyasa yoga instructor hails from Jersey. Her chef husband, Matt Hyland, is also not from Detroit. He was born in Brooklyn, but raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. Dedicating Emmy Squared to Detroit-style pizza was an accident. They planned to open their sophomore endeavor as a square pie joint, Hyland explained via telephone, but after he anointed his creation with that gorgeous frico crust, he realized that what he ended up with was ""accidentally Detroit pizza.""', '""Forty-five minutes to an hour,"" the host tells me around 7 p.m. on a Saturday night at Emmy Squared. Around 8 p.m. she’s quoting two hours (during weeknights the wait is often under 30 minutes). There’s your proof that New Yorkers aren’t pizza isolationists. And there’s your motivation to speed things up with takeout. Another reason why takeout is a smart move here: Emmy Squared’s marble bar, hard table tops, stools without backs, and cramped environs make for an uncomfortable, ear-piercing meal.', '[The dining room at Emmy Squared]', 'Emmy Squared serves a mean pile of fries – waffle cut, doused with mayo, and topped with smoky bonito. The restaurant also serves a spicy chicken sandwich bristling with crunch, even if it’s not quite Fuku quality. This is Williamsburg, so there’s the requisite raw kale option for those who like salads as chewy as leather. You could order these things, but then you’d be full before that beast of a pie comes out. The move is to treat Emmy as a restaurant that serves one thing: pizza. And that pizza is most excellent.', 'Hyland lets the dough rise in the pans, which means lots of pans, about 600 to 700. After the dough rises, he adds the cheese, sauce, and toppings, and bakes the pizza in a gas-fired convection oven (which allows for more stable temperatures than wood) for about 10 minutes. A Neapolitan pie, by contrast, takes about 60 to 90 seconds. While the pizza bakes, all the oil at the bottom of the pan fries the dough – apologies, underskirt – imparting the pie with that golden crust. All this density and crispness is what lets the pie live a second life during takeout and delivery, rather than getting soggy, like a traditional Neapolitan pizza.', 'I could rate the merits of individual toppings, but really, if you like pepperoni, you’ll get the pepperoni pie. If you’re a ranch person (a Midwestern thing), you’ll order The Emmy, topped with a homemade version of the dressing, vivid with green tarragon. I’m tempted to say don’t be that person, but I’d probably be chased out of town if I did. I will say the Lou Wow is the rare intelligent riff on a hammy Hawaiian pie — it has a wicked coating of chiles on the pineapple to counterbalance the fruit’s natural sugars.', '[The Emmy and the chicken sandwich]', 'And keep in mind that you’re not getting fresh, hand-crushed tomatoes. You’re getting sauce. There’s acidity, but this is more about tomato puree, amped up with wine, onions, and garlic. That richness translates to the overall eating experience. Remember to pace yourself while eating: You’re working with a lot of carbs here. If the standard rule at a Neapolitan pizza parlor is a whole pie per person, at Emmy I’d say anywhere from half to two thirds of a pie per guest is about right.', 'Just one gripe, because I wouldn’t be a true New Yorker if I didn’t complain about pizza. With pies this gut-busting, would it be the worst thing in the world if Emmy Squared sold them by the slice, especially in the after hours?', 'The Neapolitan pie, the proud parent of the New York slice, has long been the dominant force in the new wave of big city pizza, but even within that category you find a bevy of styles. In the mid-aughts, classicists like Keste and Don Antonio peddled tomatoes from the volcanic soil of San Marzano, cheese from the overrated water buffalo, and pies that were gently soupy and droopy in the center. More subversive types like Roberta’s forged a more New York-influenced version of the Neapolitan pie, stiffening up the crusts, and throwing on anything and everything, from pastrami to blue cheese to honey to pickle juice. Cracker-like Roman pizzas popped up at Danny Meyer’s Marta, while Sullivan Street Bakery took a different approach to Rome, serving al taglio-style room temperature flatbreads with crimson tomatoes and mandoline-shaved zucchini slices.', ""This year in particular we've seen pizzaiolos doubling down on anti-traditionalism. Pasquale Jones, at first glance, is a standard New York Neapolitan joint, except those pies are paired with a breathtaking selection of half-bottles poured into what might be the world’s greatest stem: Zalto. Speedy Romeo on the Lower East Side, a spinoff of the Brooklyn original, slings St. Louis-style pies with thin crusts, pickled peppers, square cuts, and melted Provel, the processed cheese blend beloved by Missourians."", 'New York, in short, has transformed itself into a global clearinghouse and testing ground for regional and international pizza styles. That ecumenical fervor extends even to styles that in earlier decades might have been deemed mere lesser cousins, like the New Haven.', '""For a Saturday, our waits can easily hit three hours,"" a receptionist tells me at the flagship Emily, which opened in Clinton Hill in 2014. Detroit-style squares apparently have not undercut customers’ love of their round pies. This critic sometimes prefers the pies at Emily to the pizzas at Emmy Squared for a simple reason: I can eat more slices before filling up.', 'The Emily space is smaller than Emmy Squared. It’s a short, rectangular room with a black top bar, brown wood floors, white walls, and various other surfaces that will shatter your eardrums. But put up with such ignominies you will, because Emily is one of the few New York venues that tips its hat to the pizza traditions of New Haven, where venues like Frank Pepe’s and their coal fired ovens produce meatier crusts and more burnished underskirts than their closest analogues – the New York slice.', ""The Hylands serve two mean beef burgers, and both are complicated to order, per the prevailing pre-apocalyptic zeitgeist of making patrons grateful to eat meat.

And he employs a wood-fired oven, which he keeps at a lower than normal temperature to allow for a longer New Haven-style bake, up to two and a half minutes. If a classic Neapolitan pie is more like a filet mignon in its chew, Emily’s version is closer to a skirt steak: It tires the jaw just a hint more, but the payoff is more flavor in the crust, with just enough carbonized char to impart roundness and smokiness rather than bitterness.', 'The entire awesome experience jolts you to the same carbophilic conclusion as does Emmy Squared: This is among the city’s most unique and exciting pizza.', ""That said, Emily feels like more of a proper restaurant than Emmy Squared — the latter is more of a stripped-down affair designed to get you in and out.

Inevitably, the story behind the word or phrase is a red herring — something about a childhood turtle that ran away, a corgi that was flushed down the toilet, or an obscure street that was irrevocably altered when Robert Moses ruined the mom and pop ethos of a now condo-pocked neighborhood. These tales serve to distract from what truly matters, which is everything else.', 'Each word I devote to explaining why an establishment is named for a fake ancestor who bartered for finger limes with Kool-Aid points – a history I can’t possibly verify – is one less word I have at my disposal toward assessing the worth of a venue, the value of its prices, the quality of its, say, tomato-skin tacos. A restaurant’s name is its own narrative. A review, by contrast, is not the restaurant’s narrative. It is the critic’s narrative. It’s my narrative.', 'Then again, I occasionally break my own rules. Take Paowalla, a new Soho outpost from Floyd Cardoz whose moniker is fantastically straightforward. Paowalla is a Portuguese-Hindi hybrid word meaning ""a person who sells bread,"" and it’s an appropriate title for a lovely spot that pays homage to the diverse baked goods of the South Asian subcontinent.', 'Paowalla’s name is useful in the most direct sense. What makes the restaurant one of the city’s most essential new spots is its array of breads, Indian and Indian-inspired — from whole wheat rotis, to puffy kulchas, to Tibetan tingmos, to tandoori-bruised naans, to room-temperature fish pies, to mini wada pao sandwiches (don’t you dare call them sliders), to honey-lime croissants, to pecan chai sticky buns. If a diner ever feels overwhelmed by the voluminous, hit-or-miss menu, she can remember what the restaurant calls itself and know precisely what to order: carbs, carbs, and more carbs.', '[Bacon naan and shrimp pie]', 'Bacon naan, a BLT without the L or the T, is back after a six-year absence from the New York dining scene. It’s heated up in the tandoor oven to the chewy texture of an Olive Garden breadstick. It’s stuffed with a thin layer of minced pork belly. And it’s cut into six triangular slices like a pizza. Those who find it a touch salty can order a $3 side of yogurt raita – though one can’t help but wonder whether these will evolve at some point into a cool ranch dipping sauce. I wouldn’t put it past Cardoz, one of the city’s most creative chefs, a hospitality industry veteran who’s found his groove again by slinging egg creams, wok-frying chile chicken, and baking darn good bread.', 'Before Paowalla, informed gourmands would talk about Cardoz’s food they way they’d talk about the forgotten recipes of a deceased grandparent, which is to say wistfully, and with a malaise suggesting that no one else might discover such flavor combinations again.', 'The Mumbai-born, Lespinasse-trained chef rose to fame at the helm of Tabla, the Union Square Hospitality Group restaurant that tried to persuade turn-of-the-millennium New Yorkers to accept Indian fare as a cuisine that’s as worthy of refining and rethinking as fancy French — even as critics of the era painted aspects of the venue as ""exotic"" or evoking ""the far side of the world."" Upstairs at Tabla, Cardoz went all white tablecloth and fine-dining with a tasting format, dishing up breathtaking rice-flaked halibut with watermelon curry. Downstairs, he went with the more affordable, a la carte Bread Bar (another great name), trafficking in potato apple chaat and – you guessed it – bacon naan. The restaurant, alas, was ahead of its time, and, at a whopping 280 seats, too big for its own good. It closed in 2010 after a 12-year run.

The restaurant itself isn’t much to look at; its dark browns, exposed brick, and wood-fired oven could let Paowalla pass itself off as a steakhouse, a rustic Italian spot, or a New American joint. And that’s okay, because you’re not here for a Le Coucou-style fashion show. You’re here to eat.', 'You’re here to stuff your face with bread. Tingmo, a pinwheel of steamed dough brushed with a smoky garlic-chile chutney, evokes the gorgeously doughy texture of an underbaked Pillsbury dinner roll.

Or the rolls might be served as wada paos, stuffed with fried potato dumplings, seasoned with three different chutneys ranging from mouth puckering to incendiary, and finished with chura, the delicious bits of batter that fall off during the frying process and take on the flavor of a coconut-flavored crisp.', 'Daal with burrata', 'Shall I go on?

And here it’s worth recognizing how vital the Indian restaurant community has been in helping New Yorkers, on a subconscious level at least, appreciate the cost of baked goods. Many give props to Momofuku’s David Chang, who, in 2006, ruffled feathers when he became one of the first major New York restaurants to charge for a baguette with good butter. But South Asian spots, the erstwhile Tabla included, have almost always charged for their made-to-order breads.', 'Not even the naan is gratis at Paowalla. Nor should it be.

The flavor of the sauce and the spices are intense at first, but then they soften when you get to the surprising heart of the bowl: a baseball-sized gob of burrata.

Indo-Chinese fare, from Babu Ji’s Gobi Manchurian sweet-sour cauliflower to Pondicheri’s Sichuan peppercorn-braised paneer, is experiencing a boomlet of sorts, and Cardoz is on it. He takes tender-as-hell chicken oysters, the most prized part of the bird, douses them in tamari, and then wok fries them with garlic, cilantro, serrano chiles, finger chiles, and Thai chiles. The pain is intense, but stay with it — the flavor that arises is clear and pure.

140,"[""One star for Andrew Carmellini's Italian spot in the William Vale Hotel"", '', 'If you wanted to dismiss Leuca offhand, you just say it’s just another Italian restaurant in Brooklyn. But I assure you, there’s more to it than that. Leuca is the first Brooklyn restaurant by Andrew Carmellini, one of Manhattan’s most notable Italian-American chefs. Leuca, located in Brooklyn, arguably this country’s capital of pizza, is the first Andrew Carmellini restaurant to regularly serve pizza. Leuca, a big-deal Manhattan chef’s first restaurant in Brooklyn, a borough known for its restraint and respect for the past, serves its Neapolitan pies at the bottom of a chic new hotel where a two-night weekend stay runs about $800. Takeout is not available, which is just as well, because Leuca does not make terribly good pizza.', 'Back in his days running Cafe Boulud, Carmellini oversaw some of New York’s most groundbreaking chefs — Rich Torrisi, Mario Carbone, and David Chang, among others — working in his kitchen. In the years since he’s branched out to launch his own empire. His restaurants (with one exception), aren’t so much groundbreaking as they are reliably delicious, which is no less a virtue: He hawks fare like malty fleur de sel pretzels at Lafayette, saucy ""grandmother’s ravioli"" at Locanda Verde, and a dish of linguine with four cloves of garlic at Bar Primi. He’s done well with reliably delicious.', 'But pizza is a different ballgame. Testing out your first-ever pizza restaurant in Brooklyn is like testing out a smoked beet dish in Copenhagen: It’s not the most forgiving training ground. Never mind the far-flung titans like Di Fara on Avenue J, Lucali in Carroll Gardens, Totonno’s in Coney Island — Leuca is less than a ten-minute bike ride from Best Pizza or Williamsburg Pizza, two of the city’s most heralded slice joints, or a seven minute trip from Motorino, known for slinging some of New York’s most stunning Neapolitan pies.', 'How does Leuca’s classic margherita measure up? It’s fine, which isn’t enough. The crust is nicely formed, but it doesn’t have the depth or complexity that sparks a conversation with your server about breadmaking or starter doughs. The sauce is tangy, but it doesn’t sing with electric acidity or the fruity aroma of tomatoes. The mozzarella is stretchy and salty, but it doesn’t blossom with the concentrated milkiness of its higher quality counterparts, fior di latte or mozzarella di bufala.', 'So, pass on the pizza. But nor is Leuca going to be your go-to for Southern Italian food, which fills the rest of the menu. It’s a perfectly acceptable option if you’re staying at the hotel, and it’s raining outside, and you don’t feel like exploring the rest of New York City for more inspired fare. That scenarios aside, it’s not where you want to be.', 'Mafaldini', 'A booth at Leuca overlooking the kitchen', 'Set on concrete stilts twenty meters above North 12th Street in Williamsburg, three blocks in from the waterfront, the William Vale offers occupants of its rooms uninterrupted vistas of Midtown Manhattan, the architectural equivalent of a child sitting on his mother’s shoulders at a baseball game, ensuring a fine view for herself but blocking the sightlines for others.', 'This is a restaurant review, not a meditation on urban planning, but failing to discuss the William Vale Hotel and what it symbolizes for the future of Kings County would be akin to reviewing the hot dogs at Yankee Stadium without talking about baseball.', 'If Brooklyn, as a brand, manifests itself as a hybrid of a fanatical love for the past, a DIY ethos, and a healthy chip on the shoulder, then the William Vale, a blocky spaceship hovering above the landscape, is everything but. The months-old hotel feels like an illogical next step for this slice of North Brooklyn, the neighborhood that NYU’s Urban Studies center identified last year as New York City’s overall most gentrified.', 'The story of Williamsburg as a locus of hipsterdom begins decades ago, but the neighborhood’s big moment came in 2005, when the city rezoned the warehouse-filled, post-industrial waterfront for residential use. Chic, glassy apartment buildings sprang up, and the well-heeled twenty- and thirty-somethings who could afford to inhabit them provided the customer base for a strip of restaurants along Wythe and Kent, including the now-closed Isa (where Estela’s Ignacio Mattos Rose to fame), and the original Aska, one of the area’s first tasting menu spots.', 'At the same time, ignominies and disparities became impossible to ignore. Rents in Williamsburg and Greenpoint skyrocketed, going up 78.7 percent from 1990 to 2014. The area’s formerly robust Hispanic population dwindled, forced out to more affordable parts of Brooklyn and Queens as rents rose, and the neighborhood got whiter and richer.', 'Many of the new waterfront apartment buildings, interchangeable towers of glass and steel, rose high enough to block views of Manhattan, a cold contrast to the brick-walled, low-slung warehouses they stood alongside. Brooklyn Bowl, with its handsome exterior, felt like a gift at first, until the introduction of nightly cover charges essentially made it one of the city’s most expensive venues for knocking down pins. The Wythe Hotel opened, and quickly became famous for Reynard, a ground-floor restaurant with an excellent natural wine program, as well as its perennial around-the-block lines to get into the elevator for the rooftop bar.', 'Now there’s the William Vale, another hotel taking advantage of the neighborhood’s cool-kid cachet. Unlike the Wythe, whose casement windows and dark color palette are a new-construction nod to the vanishing old, the William Vale features sleek airport-style sliding doors opening up to a white, sterile lobby that never seems to have anyone in it (unless, of course, you count the line to get into the elevator for the rooftop bar). An art installation sprawling up the back wall of the lobby is supposed to represent Brooklyn. The title of the work is ""Mannahatta.""', 'The exterior of the William Vale Hotel', ""Fire-roasted cabbage, Leuca's Caesar riff"", 'It’s against this bourgeois backdrop that one considers Leuca. Restaurants, of course, are often studies in escapism, and Leuca delivers in that regard: It’s a Williamsburg restaurant pretending to be a stadium-sized spot in the Meatpacking District. I sip at a $14 spritz, served in what appears to be an opaque, fish-shaped flower vase and observe its largely windowless main room, filled with comfy brown banquettes, brown wood walls, brown wood floors, and four uncomfortably oversized photos of a little blonde girl making faces.', 'A waiter burdens our table with a few pounds of hot pork. This is the festa de maiale, a suckling pig whose skin is aggressively bronzed and whose somewhat unevenly cooked flesh is disappointingly under-salted. A pool of caper honey adds a touch of sweet zing to the musky flesh, but really, for $72 (this is the restaurant’s most expensive dish), you expect more careful cooking and seasoning. Large format dishes like this one make up half of the menu’s six mains; if you’re not dining alone, you can enjoy a $48 chicken for two (remember when chicken used to be a solo item?) and a $68 lamb, and if you’d like to bring the sharing ethos with you into the dessert course, an oversized riff on an affogato called the Sophia Loren.', 'Really, there’s not a whole lot to say about the food here, a sentiment that appears to be shared with whoever writes the menu: dish names occasionally lack any meaningful descriptions. That chicken for two, for example, is prepared ""rosalina"" style (this turns out to mean lemon and oregano). Lobster ""in purgatorio"" is a basic chile-and-butter topping for the crustacean; about par with a similar version I had at a restaurant I stumbled across in Washington back in 2002. And steak ""vesuvius"" takes the form of a New York strip topped with a cross between a salsa rosso and a romesco sauce; the garnish is a brilliant balance of heat, acid, and sugar, but the thin, under-charred, one-note beef diverts this interpretation of the Italian-American culinary experience through a detour at Applebee’s.', 'Carmellini loves to pair squid ink pasta with calamari. He’s served mind-bending riffs on that matchup at his other restaurants, sometimes adding a bit of chorizo or bacon jam for smoky, spicy overtones. But at Leuca, he pairs black shells and pedestrian calamari with a thin, sleepy tomato sauce. He also gives New Yorkers what might be our thousandth iteration of sea urchin spaghetti over the past twelve months, which would be fine it it were an improvement upon all the rest. Sadly, Lecua’s feels as if it were slicked with Elmer’s glue.', 'These are the type of pasta dishes that make you miss the compelling reliability of Locanda Verde or Bar Primi; in fact, Leuca as a whole makes you wish this was another outpost of the Dutch, Carmellini’s most Brooklyn-esque restaurant, which happens to be in Soho. There, Carmellini’s kitchen espouses a style of multiculturalism — a Latin-inflected take on tripe, Korean-inspired fried rice, matzoh ball soup, lamb neck mole, Caribbean goat pie — that still feels ahead of its time. Looking at the lay of the land in North Williamsburg, whose string of capable restaurants nevertheless feel somewhat monochromatic, and where there’s no shortage of Italian options, it’s hard not to wonder if the Dutch would’ve been a better fit. Alas, an Italian restaurant is what Carmellini — and his partners in the hotel — have given us.', 'The Sofia Loren, an oversized affogato', 'The good news, at least, is that Leuca throws together some pretty great dips, from a silky chickpea spread with bottarga (though the bottarga appears in name only, don’t expect much of its briny-sour tang) to a milky scoop of honey-topped ricotta. The raw tuna with green olives, chile, and crispy farro is serviceable, while the obligatory smoked beets taste like a phoned-in dish that couldn’t quite fit on the menu at Little Park, Carmellini’s lovely, vegetable-heavy hangout in lower Manhattan. The one don’t-miss dish is Leuca’s riff on Caesar salad: a mound of fire-roasted cabbage leaves, charred and then enlivened with lemon, parmesan and anchovy.', 'It’s also worth noting that my first bite of Carmellini’s pesto pasta among the best culinary experiences I’ve had over the past year. Just the first bite, though — the rest of the dish revealed itself to be strikingly unbalanced. The noodles are malfadini, long ruffled ribbons, cooked to an al dente density that almost feels like udon. The kitchen tosses the strands in a rapini pesto, twirls it all together in a bowl, and garnishes the verdant pasta with viridian sweet-and-sour peppers: all the colors of the Italian flag in a bowl. The first bite is truly stunning, a shock of bitter from the broccoli rabe offset by the sugars and acid of the peppers.', ""But as you eat more, you’ll realize the sauce is a touch heavy, perhaps because the pasta isn't hot enough. And there aren’t quite enough peppers to include them in every bite, which means that the pesto’s bitterness starts to prevail, and the dish loses its footing. In the end, I found myself dredging the noodles through the remains of my starter of ricotta dip, though not voluntarily: Our server failed to change out the share plates between courses. (Service was generally impeccable over my five visits, but on this particular night, it took the staff about two courses to take and deliver a drink order)"", 'I’ve heard nice things about the soft serve at Mr. Dips, Carmellini’s other William Vale venture, an outdoor burger stand that’s currently closed for the season, and I’m keen to try the donuts that Wylie Dufresne will soon start serving on the hotel’s ground floor later this winter. But for now, I’d advise patrons to skip Leuca’s generic dessert offerings, from the supermarket-bland chocolate pudding, to the $11 cheesecake that’s leaden as any version sold under glass at a neighborhood diner. If you want that family-sized Sophia Loren affogato, which runs nearly $20 after tax and tip, it’s reasonably tasty; the coffee-drenched sundae is loaded with assorted gelati, rum granita, caramel crumble, and meringue. But call me old school — I’m more of an affogato-for-one type of guy.', 'Cost: Small plates: $8-$17. Pizza: $15-$18. Pasta: $17-$26. Mains: $31-$72', 'Sample dishes: Sheep’s milk ricotta with honey and garlic, fire-roasted cabbage, chickpea spread. If you must get a pizza, the mushroom is the way to go.', 'Cost: Small plates: $8-$17. Pizza: $15-$18. Pasta: $17-$26. Mains: $31-$72']"
141,"[""Eater's senior critic awards two stars to a new Mexican restaurant in Kensington, Brooklyn"", 'Mexican food enthusiasts generally agree that the country’s most exciting eats are found in Oaxaca. In this rugged land of scenic beauty in southernmost Mexico, indigenous Native American tribes like the Zapotecs and Mixtecs still make up a large part of the population. The cooking is exceedingly time-consuming, using ingredients like nuts, herbs, fruits, chocolate, and dried chiles to make complex sauces in earthen hues called moles, which often date to pre-Columbian times. The corn-based antojitos are different, too, including garnachas, tlayudas, tetelas, and tamales that come wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks. One taste of real Oaxacan fare and you’re hooked.', 'Unfortunately, New York City generally ignores the cuisine. While Los Angeles hosts such amazing Oaxacan restaurants as the traditional Guelaguetza, and the more innovative Mole De Los Dioses, plus over a dozen others, we have only La Morada in the Bronx, where the menu merely dabbles in Oaxacan food. Stray dishes are to be found at restaurants like Rosa Mexicano and Hecho en Dumbo, but even the taco chain that calls itself Oaxaca, without a trace of embarrassment, offers little authentic Oaxacan fare. Heck, even New Brunswick, NJ, boasts at least four Oaxacan restaurants.', 'Thus it was exciting to learn that a new Oaxacan spot had opened in January on Church Avenue in Kensington. Once a pizzeria, La Loba Cantina boasts two high-ceilinged rooms outfitted with small pedestal cerveza tables; tiled flooring in random patterns; a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe; paintings of blushing, bare-shouldered señioritas; a Spanish guitar begging to be strummed; with cacti and other xerophytic foliage in profusion. In short, the place really feels like a dusty cantina in southern Mexico. The bare-bones second room is devoted to an open kitchen, while a rear courtyard catapults you back into the world of Brooklyn tenements.', 'The dining room at La Loba Cantina', 'But one glance at the menu lets you know the place is more about mezcal — a smoky spirit associated with Oaxaca — than about food. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There are 50 varieties available in small and large shots, ranging in price from $6 to $30. Many come in picturesque pours, featuring gourds, crockery, citrus wedges, and spice-dusted wooden platforms. Really, if you escape the cantina without becoming tipsy from a couple of shots, you’re missing the point of La Loba (""The She-Wolf""). The drinks list also includes themed cocktails, beers, and a roster of tequilas, but more interesting are several obscure spirits, including herby sotol, fruity raicilla, and bacanora — a liquor smelling like pears that was bootlegged before 1992 legalization, as the menu tells us.', 'Inevitably, this alcoholic onslaught overshadows the food, much of which is nevertheless quite good. Foremost on the evening menu is the tlayuda, often referred to as a Mexican pizza. A large round of hand-patted masa is rubbed with refried black beans, then heaped with spring onions, avocado, cilantro, stringy white cheese, radishes, and tomatoes. The dish is exceedingly pretty, though La Loba’s rendition is too bland and greaseless. By contrast, the tlayudas in Oaxaca often come layered with gobs of raw lard and the funky jerky called tasajo. Of the four variations at La Loba, pick the house-made chorizo ($13), rather than the plain, chicken, or cactus.', 'Faring better are the Oaxacan tetelas (two for $7), folded masa triangles stuffed with beans and cheese, delicious when dipped in the accompanying brick-red salsa. Quesadillas ($9 to $11) are huge flops of folded-over masa dough, rather than the stateside bar snack of parallel flour tortillas glued together with cheese. In this case they’re stuffed with mushrooms, squash, chicken, or just cheese. One thing to skip is the ceviche, which features fish, pineapple, and jicama mounted on two small tostadas. The problem with the restaurant’s version is too little fish. Panuchos, featuring a blue fried-tortilla base, are topped with cochinita pibil, the pork stew that constitutes Yucatan’s gift to world cuisine. Here it lacks the perfume of bitter oranges and mouth-thrashing habanero chiles.', '[Top photos: a tamale and a shot of mezcal. Bottom: pozole.]', 'A separate lunch menu available only on Saturday and Sunday afternoons offers more of interest than the evening bill of fare — though both could use more dishes originating in Oaxaca. On it is a green pozole from the state of Guerrero — a wondrous swamp of verdant flavor floating pungent fresh herbs, scimitars of green avocado, and glistening coins of radish. This is the very spirit of southern Mexico expressed in a soup. Almost as good is the luncheon repast of tired tortillas called chilaquiles (which you should ask to be customized with a pair of fried eggs), and memelitas — miniature ridged masa vessels filled with refried beans and cheese. La Loba could become your favorite brunch spot in Kensington.', 'The best thing on the menu is the Oaxacan tamale ($5), found on the brunch menu but also usually available in the evenings. Bursting with shredded poultry, red chile sauce, and herbs, it comes wrapped in banana leaves, which impart a creamier texture to the masa than corn husks. You could happily make a whole meal of these — washed down with a shot or two of mezcal, por supuesto.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, featuring two tamales as apps, a tlayuda, a quesadilla, and two large shots of mezcal, including tax but not tip, $65', 'Sample dishes: green pozole, cheese-and-bean tetelas, banana-leaf tamales, chorizo tlayuda.', 'What to drink: watermelon juice, beer, margaritas, or shots of mezcal.', 'Bonus tip: If you use La Loba as a drinking and snacking destination, you’ll be satisfied, but it doesn’t function well as a full-meal destination.

142,"['In a culinary landscape veering toward Italian overload, New York’s most elegant establishment still sets the standard', ""The linguine alla scampi at Del Posto, Manhattan's grand theatre of Italian dining, looks like a version you'd get at one of those New York institutions straight out of The Godfather: ribbons of flat noodles snaring crustaceans in a buttery gloss. From the first twirled forkful, though, it's clear that Mark Ladner, Del Posto's executive chef, has transformed the classic dish from the inside out. He's a watchmaker who disassembled a Timex, and somehow rebuilt it into a Rolex."", ""Ladner uses langoustines — actual scampi — rather than the shrimp that have become an adaptive standard in this country. He blanches the lanky critters in broth with wine and aromatics, removes them in order to separate out the meat, and then chucks the shells back in the pot to reinforce the stock. Linguine, freshly pulled from boiling water, is tossed in this amped-up liquid, building an echo of briny sweetness between the pasta and the seafood. An emulsion of butter and olive oil varnishes the langoustine tail meat, which register as remarkably supple (but not at all mushy) against the al dente strands. The finishing accents of Calabrian chile flakes and Sorrento lemon from the Amalfi coast may be imported directly from Italy, but the scampi's righteous gusto and its melding with comforting noodles distinctly invoke the big-hearted spirit of Italian-American cooking."", 'The effect is entirely by design. Del Posto is a restaurant whose name translates to of the place, and the sense of place in question spans continents. The kitchen treats the Italian-American lexicon as one of the great regional cuisines of Italy, presenting lobster Caesar salads and chicken alla scarpariello right alongside Livornese seafood stew and pastas in endlessly varying patterns and extrusions.', ""No matter the dishes' origins, it's the molecular-level consideration that Ladner lavishes on their recipes that makes eating here, at the country's most opulent Italian tasting-menu restaurant, still a thrillingly relevant experience even eleven years after its opening."", 'Burnt beef ribeye', ""Of course, a mixing of true-minded and transformed Italian dishes fuels the playbook for many of the dozen-plus restaurants run by Del Posto's famed principals: Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich, and Lidia Bastianich. But here, at their most elegant and exorbitant venture, a broadly enticing formula is particularly vital. The 11,000-square foot dining space has scores of seats to fill, as well as ferocious, continually evolving competition from which to set itself apart."", ""Del Posto opened at the end of 2005 as the pinnacle of Batali and Joe Bastianich's Manhattan restaurant empire, a sweeping, two-story statement in marble and mahogany that culminated the successes they'd had with raucous Babbo, Roman osteria Lupa (where Ladner, a partner in Del Posto, cooked previously), seafood tour de force Esca, and others. After swinging open Del Posto's doors, the pair would go on to expand to Las Vegas and, with Nancy Silverton, launch the wonderful Mozza restaurants in Los Angeles and eventually beyond."", 'It feels like an ageless oasis, an elegant extrication from the always-rushed dailiness of life.', ""Earlier this year Batali and Bastianich circled back to New York with the shiny, always-packed La Sirena in the Maritime Hotel a block away from Del Posto. The meal I had recently at La Sirena (barring Michael Laiskonis's exquisite desserts) had a detached quality — indifferently seasoned pastas, an under-dressed salad — that served to highlight how many better, bolder, more exhilarating Italian-American restaurants have opened in New York in the last decade. (Major Food Group's genre benders like Carbone and Santina, and Brooklyn's pizza-and-so-much-more haven Roberta's stand out among many examples.)"", ""Del Posto, undeniably the finest among Batali and Bastianich's New York restaurants, has always differentiated itself through utter luxury. Some of the splendor feels timeless: the starched linens and crystal candle globes; a musician caressing the keys of a grand piano, which sits by a lit staircase that leads to second-floor tables overlooking the dining room like boxes at the opera. To some it comes off as gimmicky; to me, it feels like an ageless oasis, an elegant extrication from the always-rushed dailiness of life."", 'Panna cotta', ""Other extravagances roll subtly with the times. A baguette appears with a sphere of whipped crème fraîche and cultured cream that is burrata's cumulus cousin. Both lunch and dinner at the restaurant begin with a progression of assaggi, or tastings. They include fritters suffused with pecorino and black pepper — cacio e pepe, the dynamic flavor duo of the moment. One bite delivers the combination's umami jolt, and it's really all you need. The showstopper is a small teacup half-full of the most intense, concentrated chicken soup in the galaxy. Ladner and his crew spend three days and use 90 birds in succession, 30 at a time, producing this liquid. It arrives bobbing with a matzo ball-like dumpling made with corn flour, and a sip warms you like the blessings of a thousand grandmothers. It's a nod to the current popularity of Ashkenazi Jewish foods in America's restaurant culture, a testament to the universality of chicken soup, and an opening salvo announcing Ladner's mastery."", 'Mark Ladner is a watchmaker who disassembled a Timex, and somehow rebuilt it into a Rolex.', ""Astonishments like that soup also help justify the cost of admission. Dinner comes in two prix fixe formats: $149 for five courses in which diners choose each of their dishes (several options come with $10-$20 upcharges), or $179 for an eight-course tasting menu with choices already set, of which there is also a vegan version. The three-course lunch, formerly heralded as one of the city's great bargains at $29, has slid up to a still-reasonable $49. While individual prices are not listed, everything on the menu can also be ordered a la carte, an especially welcome possibility while sipping a barrel-aged Negroni or a Nebbiolo at the restaurant's sumptuous bar."", ""However you choose to construct your meal, keep in mind that the pastas will serve as your meal's spiritual anchor, and the simpler the dish sounds, the more stunning it is likely to be. Someone at the table should opt for the agnolotti dal plin, a Del Posto favorite of fluted, rectangular ravioli stuffed with a smooth mix of pork, veal, and mortadella, the dumplings lolling in Parmigiano-Reggiano butter. Even dreamier are bauletti, larger bundles gushing sheep's milk ricotta and sauced in a brilliantly understated black truffle butter. (If you prefer your truffle flavoring more emphatic, start with the carne cruda, Ladner's aged-ribeye version of beef tartare.) I love that the sausage in the classic trio of ear-shaped orecchiette and broccoli rabe is made using lamb neck, an ingenious way to introduce more people to that velvety, under-appreciated cut of meat."", 'Linguine alla scampi', ""These highs soar so effortlessly that the restaurant's occasional misses have the same jarring effect as airplane turbulence. The sauce under veal alla Saltimbocca goes through a similarly slow fortifying process as the chicken soup and scampi broth — rich veal scraps and vegetables are added repeatedly to an ever-developing brodo, which is finished with Marsala — but the final effect is oddly flat and salty, with none of the wondrous nuance I'd hoped for. A gorgeously seared rib eye crowned with a charred onion salad came with a side of eggplant alla pizzaiola that turned out to be a tough, hardened puck. A tiny misstep, to be sure, but in this palace of perfectionism, such gaffes stick out."", 'Del Posto has always differentiated itself through utter luxury; some of the splendor feels timeless.', 'As do the occasional service blunders. There is the expected whirl of choreographed graciousness — smiles at the coat check and the host stand, chairs pulled out and plates placed in synchronized motions — though the seams may show when a staffer is asked to deviate from the script. At lunch, for example, my tablemate required a spoon. I caught the eye of a food runner, who, rather than asking what we might need, instead turned to our server (both were in a corner under the stairs) and wordlessly nudged him, pointing his forefinger at us. Awkward.', ""Desserts allayed any modest slips. Brooks Headley, Del Posto's wunderkind pastry chef, left the restaurant last year to run his East Village smash hit Superiority Burger. Justine MacNeil, a protégé of Headley's (she was his sous chef), took over the sweets department and has winningly made it her own, serving desserts more soulful and rustic than her predecessor's."", 'MacNeil’s pastry kitchen has dispensed with unnecessary frippery, allowing seasonal fruits in particular to trumpet their purity. A panzerotto fritto, a fried hand pie, brimmed with a marmalade of quince, blood orange, and Meyer lemon in ideal, tart-sweet proportions. Red wine and yogurt played off one another in beguiling ways to accent a rhubarb crostata. Panna cotta, scented with a grappa that reminded me of Cognac, landed lightly at the end of a long lunch.', 'Overkill is often the downfall of desserts in upscale restaurants, but MacNeil’s handiworks beautifully mirror Ladner’s pastas — directly, deeply satisfying, and deceptive in their technical prowess. That ultimately is the truest joy in dining here at Del Posto. Cerebral precision drives the cooking; what arrives in front of you, though, still conveys the emotive essence of Italian cuisine. Warm, flaky pie. Slippery noodles that yield to the teeth with just the right snap. Beyond the elegance and escapism, it’s Ladner’s exacting grasp of heart-and-mind pleasures that presages another decade of triumph for this remarkable restaurant.', 'Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly identified Abruzzo as a city, not a region.']"

No longer can a meal proceed uneventfully, it must be a roller-coaster ride of high drama, with exalted peaks of success and crashing valleys of disappointment. Sometimes our expectations run so high, they can never be fulfilled. But does a restaurant always have to be spectacular to satisfy?', 'In a recent profile of Pete Wells in the New Yorker, the esteemed Times critic tells Ian Parker that he tries to forego one-star restaurants in favor of those with more formidable accomplishments: ""No one likes one-star reviews. The restaurants don\'t like them, and the readers don\'t like them. It\'s very tricky to explain why this place is good enough to deserve a review but not quite good enough to get up to the next level."" The problem, of course, is that a vast number — perhaps a majority — of restaurants deserve one star and even aim at it. They are often enjoyable and budget-friendly, but lacking the desire to dazzle. Here are three restaurants worth reviewing that merit a single star.', 'Pinned between a fabric store and a lingerie mart on a Lower East Side corner where traditional businesses still prevail, Bing Kitchen is narrow, high-ceilinged, and whitewashed, with red paper lanterns dangling from the ceiling and a ladder made of pipes, which employees rapidly ascend to a storage loft as if performing in an acrobatic ensemble. The brief menu specializes in the northern Chinese street crepes called jianbing, which here go by the rather unfortunate name of Beijing burritos ($7).

One day I enjoyed a Yunnan-style bing stuffed with sweet-marinated beef strips and cucumbers, almost like a banh mi, while another day the fried-chicken-stuffed ""Southern Comfort"" made a memorable lunch, especially if you have the usual mung bean wrapper replaced with the crunchier, corn-flour version. As an app or side dish, the tiger salad — made of shredded scallions and cukes seasoned with a lively chile vinaigrette — constitutes a bargain at $3. This is what a one-star review does best: directs you to the things at a middling place that are emphatically worth eating.', 'In fact, these days many one-stars have limited menus centered on a single gimmick, as if the chef isn\'t trying too hard. The Lower East Side is loaded with such micro-joints, mounting intriguing but ultimately unambitious bills of fare. OCA, which means ""house"" in an indigenous Brazilian language according to the website, is more comfortable than the bare-bones Bing Kitchen, providing relaxed accommodations at several low round tables flanked by wooden benches strewn with colorful cushions. Its single specialty is once again street crepes, but this time the Brazilian version, with a tapioca-meal wrapper that is bland, white, and porous.', '[Bottom: breakfast and salmon crepes]', 'There are 11 possible choices, seven good for snacks and meals, two aimed at breakfast, and two more intended as desserts. Their costs range from $9 to $14.50, and if this seems a little steep for a stuffed pancake you can hold in your hand and eat in six or seven bites, it is. Nevertheless, a careful choice on your part makes an agreeable snack; the crepe featuring smoked salmon, wasabi, cashew cream, and pumpkin seeds is the best. (Most of the daft fillings seem directed at the health-obsessed.) The dessert crepes are too sweet, but the eggy breakfast ones — configured more like small pizzas — would make a perfect calorie-wise morning meal. Indeed, all the food at OCA is so beautiful and carefully prepared, it might be worth eating even while foregoing value and pungency.', 'While the previous establishments offer limited menus, perhaps wisely, other one-star candidates are almost comically ambitious. One such is Teremok, a Russian fast-food chain founded in 1998, now with 300 branches that has only recently burst upon the local dining scene. It aims to reproduce the comfort food of its homeland, but in a way that makes it more familiar to Americans, in a 56-item menu divided into blini, salads, kasha, and soups. At all costs, avoid the soups. Teremok also manages to keep its prices mercilessly low. The premises at both branches are unusually comfortable for fast food, with high, well-spaced wooden tables and stools with backs.', 'Sounding like the title of a lost Lou Reed song, the composed salad called ""Herring in Furs"" ($3.95) features pickled fish, sour cream, beets, potatoes, and onions layered in a sort of cold lasagna. It is massively delicious, as is the serving of kasha (buckwheat groats) topped with creamy cremini gravy ($5.45) — perfect vegetarian winter fare. ""This kasha is perfectly cooked, like my mother\'s,"" a Russian friend enthused, though she complained about the crepes called blini — the centerpiece of the menu — for their light, almost-French wrappers and odd combinations of patronizing fillings. (An example: ""Tatiana\'s Ceaser"" [sic], stuffed with chicken, lettuce, and parmesan.)']"
144,"[""Eater's senior critic awards two stars to the new Sixth Avenue Chinese restaurant"", 'Chinatown is dying. Well, not really, but in our primary Chinatowns of the Lower East Side, Sunset Park, and Flushing, the restaurant population has remained relatively static and even dwindled over the last few years, as the most interesting new Chinese restaurants have sprung up in non-traditional settings. The reason? Regional Chinese has gone mainstream — as Chinese-American did a century ago — and developed a real fandom among the general population. Thus we find, for example, food from Shaanxi Province easily accessible at the multiple locations of Xi’an Famous Foods, while Hunan cuisine has gained traction in the East Village at Hunan Bistro. Meanwhile, Sichuan like you once had to travel to Flushing to get is now readily available all over Midtown. Everywhere, Chinese fare seems to be flourishing at the fast casual, bistro, and fine dining levels.', 'As a corollary, well-capitalized Chinese restaurant chains are seeking to establish a foothold here. The latest is Hao Noodle and Tea, a first American branch of Madam Zhu’s Kitchen, founded in 2008, with six locations in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other Chinese cities. The owner, Sichuan native Zhu Rong, must have trained her binoculars on Brooklyn from across the globe, because this newcomer — in high-rent digs on Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village — looks more like a Bushwick bistro than a traditional Chinese restaurant. No dragons, crawling babies, or big round tables. Rather, Edison bulbs shoot from chandeliers, crumbling bricks and scratchy blue treatments line the walls, a flea-shop chintz lamp stands forlornly in the corner, while art photos and a profusion of potted plants freshen the loft-like interior.', 'There’s a bar up front and a larger dining room in back. Both are startlingly spacious, though seating at individual small tables is tight, and — surrounded by backless and unpadded torture stools — the long communal table in the middle is as cramped as cramped can be. Madam Zhu, please make your dining room comfy! While the liquor license is still pending, the signal beverage is a choice of premium teas, at $6 to $8 per pot. In fact, the restaurant offers a separate tea service in the afternoon, and the entire place seems more inspired by Chinese tea houses than full-blown restaurants. A large proportion of the dishes are small — so maybe Hao Noodle is also channeling American tapas bars. Luckily, the deliciousness level is often very high.', 'Recipes are drawn from many parts of China, and the menu is to be commended for not pulling its flavor punches, especially where Sichuan food is concerned. One of the best short plates is Le Shan chicken ($10) — tidbits of poultry in a gingery swamp of chile paste and Sichuan peppercorns heaped with finely diced celery, named after a small riverside city in southern Sichuan. In fact, the best deal on the menu is in a similar vein: milky mung bean jelly stacked like railroad ties, enhanced by crunchy peanuts ($6). It may be the spiciest vegan bowl in town. Other Sichuan standards include a version of dan dan mian ($8) with the softest noodles imaginable. (This isn’t Italian food, and the glove-soft texture is a revelation). But the best dish on the menu, with a breathtakingly green broth, is Madam Zhu’s spicy fish stew ($25). Watch out, tongue!', 'Le Shan Chicken', 'Never fear, there’s plenty of not-hot stuff, too. Shredded wild mushrooms that make you think of Yunnan — which is the Chinese capital of mushrooms — rest in what amounts to a crunchy puzzle box ($12), while fritters of fish flecked with seaweed seem like Japanese fast food. Chinese-American standards are represented, too, proving that Madam Zhu has been studying the history of Chinese food in America. Thus, scallion pancakes have been enlivened with shreds of seafood to good effect; on the negative side is a sweet-and-sour pork with chunks of pineapple that made me almost gag. (Yes, the precursor comes from Dongbei, but this take is clearly inspired by the gloppy American version.)', 'The restaurant provides startling selections in every corner of the long and diverse menu. As the waiter doffs the handsome lid of clay pot dumplings ($12), the steam rushes forth to reveal flattened purses made of egg omelet rather than the usual noodle material. ""What a deal,"" you sigh as you tease the pork-filled packages out of the broth. Other dishes are not such a bargain, including Shanghai ribs that came plated like an abstract painting, but with so little meat on the tiny bones that my party burst out laughing.', 'Rosewater jelly and mixed mushrooms', 'The place seems intent on belatedly mounting a new seasonal menu every quarter, with little poetic snippets here and there — and thus it was that summer appeared in August this year at the restaurant. A few old favorites I’d been enjoying over the last couple of months disappeared, including braised celtuce, a chewy vegetable sometimes called Chinese lettuce. And in their place were some new things, including a few off-the-wall recipes that made Hao Noodle seem like one of the hipster restaurants flourishing on the edge of Chinatown. There was a perfectly executed fruit salad sprinkled with black pepper; but even stranger was something called multi-grain rainbow salad ($12).', 'There before me as I peered mournfully into the bowl was a collection of faddish grains, including buckwheat, millet, and quinoa, tossed with roasted root vegetables, yellow raisins, and pine nuts like a bad day at Dimes. Compared to the really stunning stuff on the menu, it was awful. Madam Zhu, you can’t beat us at our own game, but you can beguile us by delicately rendering Chinese dishes the likes of which we’ve never seen before.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two or three small dishes, two larger dishes, and a shared dessert, washed down with free ice water, with tax but not tip, $90.', 'Sample dishes: Le shan chicken, sweetly smoked sole, Madam Zhu’s spicy fish stew, mixed mushrooms, seafood fried rice, rosewater jelly.', 'What to drink: Ice water or premium teas.', 'Bonus tip: It’s impossible to tell how big dishes really are, based on either the price or the color pictures.

As the gateway to the nation’s Rust Belt, this Lake Erie metropolis has suffered economically over the last few decades, but now seems to be on the upswing. A renewed interest in Nickel City food constitutes part of that resurgence. Buffalo’s classic sandwich beef on weck is being served here in a dozen venues, as red-lacquered chicken wings continue to fly out of the fryer as Gotham’s favorite bar snack. Perhaps even more persuasively, a new lunch counter has opened in Ditmas Park that specializes in Buffalo’s sometimes startling cuisine.', 'Seating is limited to a few stools along an orange Formica counter that angles around the interior — though most patrons opt for carryout or delivery. Pennants and other memorabilia for the Bills, Sabres, and more obscure sports teams provide decoration. Painted in a rainbow of colors, a Buffalo skyline covers an entire wall, while menus featuring Buffalo food specialties dominate two others. One offers 50 thick milkshakes concocted with Perry’s ice cream, made in Akron, New York, a small town in the dairy country northeast of Buffalo, almost close enough to be a ‘burb.', 'One shelf features a solid yellow row of Weber’s mustard squeeze bottles, flaunting Buffalo’s signature condiment. Don’t expect mayonnaise or Miracle Whip here. Another shelf displays sodas associated with the city, one flavored with loganberry, a 19th-century cross between a blackberry and a raspberry. The brand is PJ’s Crystal Beach, first served at a now-defunct Buffalo amusement park of the same name. Non-carbonated and non-caffeinated, it doesn’t fizz when you open the bottle. If you fall in love with the flavor, you can also get a milkshake made with loganberry syrup ($6). I think the chocolate shake is much better; in fact, it’s one of the best in Brooklyn.', 'One glance around the room will convince anyone that Buffalo has much to offer as a foodie destination.', 'One glance around the room will convince anyone that Buffalo has much to offer as a foodie destination, which is presumably the whole point of the place. As befits the stadium and bar food the menu represents, vegetables are in very short supply. But what about the wings? Available mild, medium, hot, or extra hot, in batches of 5 ($7) to 50 ($50), they verge on the spectacular (though extra hot was not very hot on one occasion). But aren’t all wings pretty much the same? These, according to a guy I spoke to at the counter, have been re-crisped on the grill after being dipped in hot sauce. This increases the density and gloppiness of the coating, while also making it crunchier.', 'Hot roast beef sandwiches ($7) are also available — a good wad of thin-sliced meat on a roll called a kimmelweck (or kummelweck), brought to Buffalo by a German baker around 1890. The roll has salt and caraway seeds on top, and thus tastes something like a pretzel. It’s called ""weck"" for short, making the sandwich’s nickname ""beef on weck."" This being New York City, the sandwich size is more meager than the ones I’ve eaten in Buffalo, and the meat a bit overcooked. The sandwich rocks nonetheless, especially if you load it up with the optional horseradish.', 'The grilled hot dog ($3) is a thing of beauty, in this case deploying a frank made by Sahlen Packing Company, a Buffalo company founded in 1869. Filled with a beef/pork mixture, the natural-casing wieners are delicious, though more floppy and less firm-skinned than their New York City counterparts. Don’t hesitate to go ""all the way"" with the toppings, which include dill pickle relish, a dill pickle spear, chopped raw onions, ketchup, and, of course, that horeradish-spiked Weber’s mustard. It makes a better substitute for the Chicago red hot than most that go by that name in the five boroughs.', '[Top: milkshake and hot dog.

There are also hamburgers and chicken-finger subs, decent French fries, distinguished beer-batter onion rings, and (what now, Buffalo?) fried pierogies, of which the ones stuffed with potatoes and garlic are especially tasty.', 'At some point this crazy place was sure to go off the rails. And it does.

It begins obviously enough with the bucolic setting, about 45 minutes outside New York City. The property’s driveway meanders through the grounds of the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, established ten years ago on what was previously part of the Rockefeller Estate. Ducks or chickens may waddle by; the fields in warm weather look almost extraterrestrial in their greenness. Arrive early, perhaps with a change of shoes, for a closer look at the gardens and greenhouses and pastures.', 'Inside the restaurant (once the namesake barn, built in the 1930s to facilitate a dairy farm), a centerpiece of plants and branches that is druidic in scope draws the eye. It mirrors the hillside and clusters of dense foliage out the windows. And as soon as the meal begins, diners feel the dirt under their nails — metaphorically if not quite literally.', 'No edible soil comes out of the kitchen, hallelujah. But every course in some way brings the mind back to nature. That certainly includes the meats and produce, much of which come from the property or from the Massachusetts farm operated by Stone Barn’s executive chef and co-owner Dan Barber. The presentations, too, constantly evoke the countryside: Unadorned vegetables or a veal bone filled with herbed beef heart arrive impaled on spiky instruments that resemble farm tools. A mini-trellis threaded with ""weeds"" appears alongside a planter of radiant tomatoes still on the vine. The accompaniments: tarragon pesto and garden shears. Barber, the country’s most articulate chef on matters of sustainability, glorifies every part of the animal. Pork eye socketMy favorite surprise animal part this time: deboned and puffed chicken feet, crunchy and airy like avian chicharrones. - BA (its texture surprisingly friendly) may come on a plate shared with a rib and jowl meat.', 'Veal bone with beef heart; Cantaloupe tears; Mushrooms and Eggplant', 'Skeptical first timers could at first find all this back-to-the-land hoopla a tad twee.

But I didn’t fully drink the Stone Barns Kool-Aid until I sipped Barber’s cantaloupe tearsNo cantaloupe tears this time, though we did have charentais melon wrapped in coppa that was nearly as wonderful. - BA. Glasses of the liquid came halfway through the meal, paired with coppa — lush, striated shoulder meat from the farm’s 900-pound pigs — as a riff on the Italian classic of ham and melon. The kitchen selects the most fragrant cantaloupes, roasts and purees them, and then lets the juice slowly drip through cheesecloth overnight. Its taste hurled me back to my Maryland childhood, when my mother would buy cantaloupes from a man who grew produce and sold it from the back of his pickup truck in the summer. The fruit was heavy, and so ripe it bordered on fermented. Consuming it, like the Stone Barns nectar, felt thrilling in a way that was almost animalistic.', 'Every course in some way brings the mind back to nature.', 'This is the restaurant’s ace, then: Barber’s mastery as a chef ultimately overrides any glints of preciousness.

He brought us an obscure-ish Italian white — a 2012 Timorasso \'Derthona\' from Vigneti Massa — that was rich and minerally and just right, as was the $65 price. - BA aids in the enchantment. Currently, there is only one tasting menu (though no actual document is presented) that Barber calls ""Grazing, Pecking, Rooting.""

If they sense that diners want less small bites and more substantial plates, they make adjustments. Open-minded gluttons can find themselves in the restaurant past midnight.', 'To stretch the legs, guests are often escorted to another part of the grounds for a course or two. We’d been at the table for around two hours, chowing through ever more satisfying creations: eggplant charred over house-made charcoal (using lobster shells, among other skeletal remnants) and yogurt deriving its almond flavor from apricot pits; ham, on a craggy cracker, that melted the moment it hit the tongue; a witty riff on the corn dog that entailed battered pieces of cob, from a breed of miniature corn that a farmer cultivates especially for Barber.', 'Tomatoes on the Vine; Vegetables from the field;', 'Then a server asked if we were ready for an adventure. He led us outside to the small outpost known as the ""manure shed"" and described the building’s features: A bin containing the sweetest smelling compost possible holds a temperature between 60 and 65 degrees Celsius. The kitchen uses it as an oven, cooking sealed vegetables slowly, and heat is also siphoned off from the bin and stored in coils that operate a circulator bath often used to poach eggs. Another staffer brought out a lazy Susan with sliced butterfish, cured logs of ham hock, a vase of herbs, an impressively rich take on guacamole made from artichokes, and sour cream. It was DIY taco timeOn this visit we were given a lesson in potato breeding in the shed, followed by a lovely potato course. I found that this visit, more than any others, focused more on the specialized farming and plant breeding that they do here and elsewhere for the restaurant. - AK  — with slices from a large kohlrabi (lacking any of the sulfur notes that often waft from the vegetable) subbing for tortillas.

Barber will reshape our notion of breads with the wheat strains he’s developing and the baking techniques he’s perfecting. One of three breads we tried was entirely whole wheat but feathery light; another was dense and molasses-like. All incredible. - BA. Wheat is one of his current preoccupations, and he’s been working with farmers in Seattle to grow a strain bred for flavor that also produces almost four times the yield of an average wheat crop. The bread we had was a cousin to the Seattle wheat (the long-awaited variety will debut in the restaurant this week) and it was already a slice of toast that could outpace all others in taste, nutty and ancient.', ""After marinated tomatoes with burrata ice cream, Oreos fashioned from buckwheat cookies, and blueberry jellies with dried peaches and berries This 2016 visit was actually the first time I was overly impressed with the desserts here.

The type of restaurant called a ""meat and three"" has long been a fixture of small towns from Georgia to Arkansas, a sort of Dixie diner dispensing fried chicken, meatloaf, and sweet-glazed pork ribs at prices everyone could afford. These entirely predictable mains shared the plate with three generous sides, hence the name. The side-dish choices ran to mac & cheese, collard greens, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes swimming in gravy, with a bonus piece of cornbread. I wondered at what wallet-busting prices this institution might be recreated for us Yankee city folks at Harold’s.', 'The restaurant’s namesake is Harold Moore, whose most recent stint at Commerce in the West Village ended not long ago. The chef’s current project is situated in the Arlo Hotel (named after Arlo Guthrie?), just north of Canal Street in a wind-whipped non-neighborhood near the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. The space is luxuriously large, with a main dining room ending in a kitchen where logs flame up merrily in an open hearth. Overhead, industrial fixtures shine down on a floor that might have been designed by M.C. Escher, the tiles matrixed in dizzying fashion.', 'A parallel dining room contains a liquor bar, a salad bar, and picture windows overlooking an outdoor terrace, which will be a fine place to dine in summer — assuming the restaurant survives. I believe it will. The menu offers a series of starters, including deviled eggs topped with bacon, steak tartare, pimento cheese spread, and visits to that salad bar, which, aside from a few luxury items, is nothing special. Anyway, you should skip the appetizers or ""you’ll ruin your dinner,"" as my mother might say. True to the promise of a real meat and three, a main course with three sides at Harold’s is plenty of food. (Especially since a free biscuit often precedes your meal and a tiny soft-serve cone follows it.)', 'The prime rib.', 'Priced from $18 to $42 (the former for a veggie burger, the latter for prime rib), 18 main courses are presented, along with 24 sides. The prime rib is a delight, carved tableside as it oozes juices, and so’s the hanger steak. It comes napped with an agreeable wine sauce, listed on the menu — which is not above spouting French — as ""marchand du vin."" Other notable choices include roast chicken, beer-can style; a thick pork chop; seared sea scallops; and veal meatballs. In the first weeks those meatballs came in gravy, later in tomato sauce. Indeed, the chef is always diddling with the menu, making every visit an adventure.', 'One day, I arrived to discover the pork chop, once plainly grilled, was now being offered Sichuan-style. It came in an ""au jus"" that was only slightly spicy, while a coating of Sichuan peppercorns on the surface of the meat furnished a substantial tingle. Score one surreal taste sensation for the chef. Less successfully, an entree of tripe bathed in New Mexican green chiles was a failure one evening, with too many white beans and too little offal.

She uses a broad range of wheat, rice, and mung-bean noodles to create her sometimes surprising bill of fare.', '[Myo Moe]', 'These noodles can take the form of stir-fries, soups, or cold summer salads, with some dishes toggling between those modalities. Individual recipes vary from week to week, so that one Wednesday if you order beef shan noodle —attributed to a state in eastern Myanmar bordering China— it may be a heap of slippery and pungently oily rice linguine shot with beef nuggets, shredded omelet, crunchy peanuts, and cilantro, tasting powerfully of fish sauce and secondarily of tomato. Another week, the sauce might be thicker and more tomatoey, with a heap of ground beef almost like an Italian ragu. Either way, the noodles are memorably tasty.', 'Another classic is chicken coconut noodle, which may remind you of khao soi, the coconut noodle soup usually attributed to Chiang Mai, a city that lies just south of Myanmar in Thailand. At Rangoon NoodleLab, it’s a steaming heap of curried and stomach-comforting wheat noodles, enlivened by bits of pickled vegetable and crunchy rice cracker tidbits. But a couple of Wednesdays later, it had turned into a full-blown soup with plenty of broth heavily laced with thick coconut milk. The changes Moe weekly wreaks on her noodles provide a reason to visit her temporary establishment again and again.', '[Chicken coconut noodle]', 'There’s always a vegan selection, and it can be the week’s best. One time it was a bowl of translucent mung-bean threads laved in hoisin that provided a spicy kick in the pants. On another occasion it was a broad wheat noodle in a dryish curry with carrots, planked with something called chickpea tofu, warm and creamy like egg custard. The bowl came with fresh mint leaves quivering on top and a wedge of lime that moistened the noodles and sent the flavor into orbit. It was the spiciest thing going on in Bushwick that evening.', 'Wearing a blue apron with a shock of blond hair poking out from under her head scarf, the bespectacled Myo Moe works, not in a kitchen, but at a corner mise en place behind the bar at Bodega. Sometimes an assistant helps as she pivots between a tray of plastic-wrapped, parcooked noodles (usually three varieties per evening), and small bowls of spices, herbs, and chopped and pickled veggies. Most of her selections are prepared on a pair of hot plates in Teflon skillets, meaning if a table of four orders different things, the dishes must appear in waves. Sometimes there’s a wait.', '[Beef shan noodles, coconut tapioca, and garlic pork noodles]', '""Many of my recipes come from my mother,"" she told me one evening as I sat with some friends at the bar. ""But I like to change them a little every time I make them."" Indeed, every dish I’ve tried there has been interesting at the very least. And I found myself counting the days till the next Wednesday, when I’d see what new tweaks had been accomplished on what had become old favorites. In this way fandom is born.', ""Robert Sietsema is Eater New York's senior critic.

149,"[""Eater’s senior critic awards three stars to the New York outpost of Michael Solomonov and Steve Cook's casual Israeli restaurant"", 'One day, to establish a flavor baseline for the city’s hummus, I hopped on my bike and pedaled to several iconic spots. The weather was sweltering, the perfect time to test the creamy chickpea dip redolent of wind-whipped sands and the merciless desert sun. My first stop was Taïm, a small storefront just off Perry Street specializing in flavored falafels run by Israeli chef Einat Admony. Pooled with olive oil and rimmed with sumac, the hummus was liquid and salty and nutlike. It was tendered with a pita brushed with olive oil and za’atar that served as the perfect flavor foil. At historic Mamoun’s on MacDougal Street — where hummus was popularized in the ‘70s, becoming an instant hit with students, vegetarians, and bohos — the product was pastier and more richly flavored, tasting pungently of cumin, lemon, and garlic, though the cardboard pitas were a disappointment.', 'A short ride against traffic brought me to Hummus Place on 7th Avenue South just off Bleecker Street. Founded a decade ago in the East Village, it was one of the first places in town to suggest that hummus could be the centerpiece of an entire menu — an idea that Dizengoff was later to adopt. At Hummus Place the product flaunted its slippery texture and strong olive oil taste, but offered little else in the way of flavor thrills. Which brings us to the whole point of this round-up. Several times sitting at Dizengoff’s curving red counter I’ve heard customers exclaim, ""This is the best hummus I’ve ever tasted!"" And I wondered, ""Could it really be the best?""', 'Located in one of the food court areas of the Chelsea Market, Dizengoff is a Philadelphia import, part of chef Michael Solomonov and business partner Steve Cook’s expanding restaurant empire there, which includes a sit-down Israeli restaurant, a Jewish Eastern European tapas joint, a doughnut and fried chicken carryout, a first Dizengoff, and, until a recent sale, an American-style barbecue. New York’s Dizengoff seats around 20 at a counter that undulates alongside a kitchen with a flaming metal oven. Above the counter are ranked cans of Israeli pickles. But the oven is the center of attention, and from it fly thick and lightly charred pitas that vie with the hummus as the most important part of the meal. They arrive steaming, packaged in formfitting paper bags.', 'Yes, it’s the best hummus in town. ', 'But how is the hummus? Elemental might be the best description. The flavor is limited to a single strong and lingering note: cumin. The texture is fluffy; almost unbelievably so. In fact, as you sit mopping it from the inside of your black plastic container with a torn fragment of pita, it threatens to detach itself and ascend to the ceiling. Yes, it’s the best hummus in town. In addition to the flatbread that comes alongside, you also get a chopped Israeli salad, a slender cucumber pickle or two, and some house-pickled onion swatches that, as the counter guy hastened to tell me one afternoon, ""should be used as alternate scoops for the hummus.""', '[Clockwise, from the top left: the dining counter, hummus with vegetables, chef/partner Emily Seaman, hummus with chicken]', 'By itself, hummus would forever remain a condiment or a side dish. So what goes in the middle for your further dipping pleasure is of supreme importance. This is the responsibility of chef/partner Emily Seaman, who, in the early days of the Chelsea Market Dizengoff, was seen heroically pulling pitas from the oven. (When she’s not making them, they are sometimes not as good.) Five hummus variations priced from $10 to $13 are available, but part of the genius of the place is that the roster is always shifting, making a visit to Dizengoff a culinary adventure. Many, like tahini, fava beans, or a soft-boiled egg (which sometimes comes with potato chips) are entirely predictable.', 'Others that aren’t have included zucchini with hazelnuts, sliced avocado with peanut harissa, and romanesco — that green fractal vegetable in the cauliflower family — with toasted pine nuts. If you’ve gotten the idea that Dizengoff is a vegetarian joint with lots of vegan options, you’re right. But additionally offered is one meaty topping per day, at the highest price tier. In the early days it was lamb. Which was also a bit of a disappointment because it was lamb stew rather than a charcoal-grilled kebab, which is the more conventional accompaniment. Currently, the choice is coarsely ground chicken in red oil with Persian spices, which is beyond delicious. In fact, it’s my favorite topping of all those I’ve tried over the last four months.', '[shakshuka]', 'That’s pretty much the extent of Dizengoff’s menu. From 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. you can also enjoy shakshuka ($10), eggs poached in a tomato-chile sauce, served with the aforementioned pita. There’s also a rotating selection of composed cold dishes, called salatim ($4 each, 3 for $11 with pita). These run from the exciting (matbucha, a braised tomato salad) to the not-so-exciting (stewed cabbage, wherein the vegetable was undercooked, making it a slog to eat). Predictably, the hummus itself remains the superstar of the show.

150,"[""Eater's senior critic awards two stars to a Japanese newcomer along Sixth Avenue"", 'All this decade chain restaurants from Japan have been helicoptering in and opening branches— often their first United States location — in New York City. Here, despite what must be equally high rents, Japan-born restaurants can still experience tumultuous welcomes, with lines of customers snaking down the block when a place debuts, and sometimes thereafter. Ippudo (ramen) and Tsurutontan (udon) are two examples, while chains like Ootoya (shopper’s cuisine) have shown a slower and steadier growth.', 'The latest culinary emissary from Japan peddles sushi. Yes, there have been import sushi chains here since at least the 1980s, when bargain-basement Genroku (long since closed) spun some rather uninspiring maki rolls around on a conveyor belt just north of the Empire State Building. On the other end of the cost spectrum, but also located on Fifth Avenue, Sushi Ginza Onodera opened its doors in May, slinging high-end, omakase-only meals. Somewhere in between lies Mi-Ne Sushi Totoya, which opened one month later with much less fanfare.', 'The company originated in 1971 in Kumamoto, a medium-size city on Kyushu, southernmost of Japan’s principal islands. Seaside Kumamoto enjoys a semi-tropical climate, not to mention being the home of a famous oyster. Four branches in Kumamoto and nine in Hong Kong preceded our New York location, which lies in Greenwich Village at Sixth Avenue and 13th Street. Detailed models of Japanese dishes glow in the front windows, through which you can spot a bar flanked by stools opulently upholstered in white. Along the opposite wall runs a line of tables that leads to the main dining room, which extends the white color scheme. Electric lights hang everywhere and the ceiling is covered in chalky lath.', 'Behind the sushi bar at the end of the room gyrate three chefs — one in black, two in white. The sushi bar is plush, but the counter’s so high you can’t see what the chefs are doing to the fish. That fish is of exemplary freshness and offered at discount prices compared to restaurants of similar quality, undoubtedly due to the buying power of the chain. Most expensive is an omakase, coming in at $55 for 11 pieces of nigiri sushi and half a maki roll. In one instance that roll featured otoro (fatty tuna, the fanciest type), and the nigiri highlights included a plump scallop lightly seared and surmounted by a face of crunchy lotus root with two preserved-plum eyes; a slice of fatty fluke with a tiny dab of dilled mayo; and a piece of nicely cooked salt water eel.', '[The dining room at Mi-Ne Sushi; part of the omakase.]', 'As if that weren’t enough, the omakase is heralded by an appetizing tour de-force consisting of nine tiny plates arrayed in a square, each with a single salutary biteful. Some involve sashimi, others seaweed, shredded vegetables, roe, or pickles. Later you get a small bowl of chawanmushi custard. This omakase constitutes too much food for one person, and it’s one of the best sushi deals in town. Other equally generous sushi and sushi/sashimi assortments are priced from $28 to $39.99. But the restaurant’s sushi stylings don’t end there.', 'It’s one of the best sushi deals in town.', 'In trying to cover all the bases, in addition to hand rolls, maki rolls, and nigiri by the piece, Mi-Ne offers temari (""hand ball"") sushi, its fish deposited on buttons of rice, aimed partly at children. As the website notes, ""It’s not really a seasonal food, but you can see a lot of temari-zushi in spring, around Girl’s Day (March 3rd) in Japan because temari-zushi is very colorful."" Who knew? But some of the menu’s most interesting offerings — which run to a bewildering 170 items — are not sushi at all, but Japanese regional specialties rarely seen in New York City.', 'A portion of the Omakase', 'From the page devoted to Kyushu cuisine: slices of lotus root tempura ($6.99), the holes oozing tangy Japanese mustard with miso; pork shabu-shabu ($12.99), which invites you to swish raw, lightly smoked bacon in bubbling water before dipping it in ponzu sauce; and, perhaps betraying the proximity of Kyushu to Shanghai, deep-fried shrimp toasts flavored with shiso leaf. Other menu items include tofu made with milk instead of soybean curd, and a broiled tuna collar ($19.99) so massive the restaurant asks it be shared among three or four diners. Miso-marinated black cod (a classic Nobu recipe) and two kinds of poké suggest the owners have carefully examined our city’s current restaurant scene before drafting their bill of fare.', 'This eclectic approach has its downside, too, especially in a page of maki rolls supposedly invented in America, which might be seen as confirmation of our own bad taste in sushi. Worst is a hire katsu roll ($13.99) in which a thin breaded pork cutlet with the texture of cheap leather is wrapped up, still steaming, in rice, proving nearly impossible to chew. Maybe less deplorable is a black cod roll that puts the aforementioned broiled fish on top of a thick roll stuffed with avocado and pickles — one is well advised to pick the morsels of fish off the top and eat them separately.', 'Ultimately, though some of the food is uneven and the service somewhat fumbling (as compensation, the tip is included in the already low prices), Mi-Ne is a great place for Japanese food of a diverse nature, or simply as an alternative to sushi bars with considerably higher prices.

152,"[""Three stars for Daniel Rose's instant French classic, Le Coucou"", ""Quenelles de brochet are not uncommon in Lyon. But in Manhattan they're a dish of longing, of memory. They evoke a pre-tweezer past when Midtown was the hip part of town and adding cream made something fancy instead of fattening. The quenelle de brochet is endangered not because gilded-age institutions spin them out of rare fish but because the dish has slipped into stateside obscurity — along with the chefs who championed them in a pre-social media age.The quenelle is what makes restaurateur Stephen Starr's Le Coucou, in the 11 Howard Hotel in Soho, an unmistakable outlier. It is the rare restaurant less than forty years old to offer this laborious dish."", ""The kitchen extricates infinite pin bones from the pike, purees the fish with cream and eggs, forms the mixture into oblong quenelles, simmers them in salt water (where they expand), drenches them in sauce Americaine (essentially lobster bisque), and bronzes them under the broiler. Cooks place a single fist-sized quenelle in a gold-rimmed bowl and ladle it with more of the frothy, concentrated shellfish sauce. The quenelle, at Le Coucou, is a maritime marshmallow in a crustacean latte. It's a throwback dish that's somehow as avant garde as an edible green taffy helium balloon; Le Coucou, after all, has transformed a firm-fleshed fish into an edible cloud, a dish so light it's as if you're eating something that isn't there. You simply look at it, Instagram it, and minutes later, it's just a daydream."", ""Welcome to one of the city's best new French restaurants, an accolade Le Coucou merits by taking its cues from the traditions of older French restaurants."", 'If you\'ve heard of Le Coucou, which you probably have since it was previewed, photographed, and explicated by all the blogs, all the major food publications, and heck, even by W Magazine, you know it\'s the celebrated New York arrival of chef Daniel Rose. The Illinois-born Rose schooled at the Institut Paul Bocuse before rising to fame in Paris at Spring, where he charges €84 EUR for a multi-course menu of modern French fare (veal ""candy"" sweetened with beets was apparently a course back in 2011).', 'The dining room of Le Coucou', ""Le Coucou, set in a room that smells sweet of slow-cooked carrots and heady organ meats, is not Spring, nor is it Rose's more bistro-esque La Bourse et la Vie, also in Paris. It takes a few more cues from a heady continental past than it does from a pared-down stateside present. There is no veal candy, only veal tongue. There are no ultra dry-aged ribeyes, only bone marrow-sauced filet mignon with pommes boulangere."", ""There are no rules against seating incomplete parties (praise the Lord). There is no dining at the bar, and to drive that point home, there are no stools at said bar. It's there for sipping non-alcoholic peach shrub cocktails and stretching your legs before a three-hour bacchanalia that can run $150 per person (those who order more prudently can slip out in under two hours)."", ""You'll tolerate that price, and the tasting menu duration of this a la carte meal because against most prevailing norms, the brick-walled, chateau-chic Le Coucou is cavernous and comfortable. That statement will be all the more true four years from now when chefs have us all eating with our hands behind our backs in pre-paid increments of thirty minutes at ticketed communal feeding troughs with kale quinoa IV drips."", ""So if it's a surprise that Rose is raking in the crowds with — and I mean this as a compliment —\x80\x94 an epic pile of pike panade, the bigger shock is that Le Coucou actually exists. Sure, La Grenouille is still alive and thriving, slinging its own majestic quenelles de brochet in Champagne cream, but most of the old-school school fancy French stalwarts (La Caravelle, Lutece, and La Cote Basque)\x80\x94 closed in the early aughts, as did their ideological successors, from Gordon Ramsay to Adour Alain Ducasse to Villard Michel Richard."", ' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNick Solares\n\n\n', 'Quenelle de brochet (top); ""Tout la lapin""; A salad of tomatoes and strawberries', ""Indeed, the Gallic scene in New York is stronger than it's ever been. The nouveau Parisian wine bar lives in full glory at creative small plates places like Wildair. The bistro is reinventing and refining itself at expensive spots like Coq Rico and Mimi. But since the Great Recession wreaked havoc on the American economy, prompting a younger generation of chefs to pursue a leaner, cheaper approach to gourmet food, the cronuts seem stacked against culinarians iterating on The Grand Fancy French spot."", ""Le Coucou isn't concerned with those odds. It's thriving right now not in Midtown but downtown, with a 39-year-old chef showing up to the cool kids' corner and iterating on his grandfather's prom suit. There's your disruption right there."", ""One minute Rose goes all 1960s light, bright nouvelle cuisine. He finds two of nature's most fragrant fruits, one sweet (strawberries), one savory (tomatoes) and doubles down on the perfume by matching them with a gazpacho of the same ingredients. The next minute he's all cuisine classique, scooping up sweetbreads the texture of pudding and serving them tableside in such a generous wash of tarragon cream sauce that it would constitute a serving of chowder in lesser restaurants."", ""Then comes a hat tip to slightly more recent times. Rose grills lobster tail to the firmness of prime rib, scents the shellfish with its own oil, and matches it with cool Bibb lettuce, basil, candied lemon, and a hot grilled tomato. The presentation is very 1980s steakhouse, stark and with the sauce on the side. And in this case it's a traditional sauce Lauris, a mix of paprika and mayonnaise made famous by the extant Guy Savoy."", ""The fact that Rose makes all these incongruities work in a single meal highlights his peripatetic, kaleidoscopic view of the past, and it's all nearly flawless. Nearly. So let's talk about a certain a pre-El Bulli spherification: oeuf norvégien, a soft-boiled egg wrapped in chive cream and artichoke and covered by a sphere of smoked salmon. Call it brunch in a ball, a pescatarian scotch egg designed to make a 1970s Better Homes & Gardens editor swoon. Let me describe how it tastes in four words: Do not order it."", ""So what separates Le Coucou from failed fancy Frenchies of the late aughts and beyond? Simple: It's fun. It's not Señor Frog's, but it's a heck of a lot more transportive than The Industrial Chef's Table Restaurant or The Generic Hotel Restaurant. Ornate chandeliers — 11 of them — plus face-height candles on every table, gold-rimmed martini stems, and sofa banquettes impart the room with a level of opulence that is part Russian oligarch, part Beauty & The Beast."", ""Rose built a fully open kitchen, lacking a firm boundary with the dining room; line cooks work behind bespoke Athanor ovens, donning those two foot-high toques they wear in culinary school subway ads. The chef has spoken of making Le Coucou a Lutece of its own era, a callback to Andre Soltner's venue that was equal parts haute cuisine and high society hangout, but Major Food Group's Goodfellas-esque Carbone, a Michelin-starred update to the Italian-American chophouse, really is the better point of reference. That's not because Le Coucou traffics in pastiche, but because it takes advantage of its black hole gravity —\x80\x94 and Starr's renowned devotion to Hollywood set design —\x80\x94 to wow New Yorkers with a few of the overlooked (or undervalued) culinary wonders of yesteryear. It's not a bad thing in an era where where newer restaurants are feeling increasingly uniform in their offerings."", ""It's a bromide to say what's old is new again, so let me put the wonders of Le Coucou in the following empirical context: It really is a commentary on the staid state of cooking in New York that one of the most refreshing piscine preparations I've had in quite some time is Rose's halibut in (the once ubiquitous) beurre blanc, the lean flaky fish elevated to heart-clogging bliss with enough emulsified butter and wine to cover the entire plate. Underneath the filet lies a mound of daikon sauerkraut: a tart, translucent not-quite-kimchi to wink at modernity before a diner drags it through all the fat."", 'The caviar course is a staple of any grand French restaurant. This indulgence typically involves about 30 grams of fish roe over ice and starts at well over a hundred bucks. At Le Coucou, the barrier to entry is lowered in exchange for a smaller portion. Cost: $38 for a coral-colored pile of golden osetra atop veal tongue. The soft meat gently warms the firm roe, helping release its briny overtones, while the caviar in turn salts the delicately flavored tongue. It evokes an era when caviar was plentiful enough to season a dish, rather than being marketed as the star of a composition.', ""Le Coucou is obvious in its luxuries: Lobster appears in three appetizers, foie gras in two, Wagyu in one. But their use isn't always obvious. The Wagyu is not steak, but rather tripe; it's been soaked, braised, fried, and laid over a brunoise of pickles and olives. Think of the crispy organ —\x80\x94 a style of stomach not uncommon in Lyon — as a fun French analogue to a Japanese pork tonkotsu."", 'The wanton maxim ""to share,"" commonly deployed by restaurants to justify the $150 chicken, isn\'t found on the Coucou menu, but perhaps it should be, as all of the fairly-priced mains are arguably portioned for two. Heck ""tout le lapin"" (all of the rabbit) could feed three. It\'s a wild trio of gamy loin (drizzled with kidney vinaigrette), neutral hind legs cooked with mustard and onions, and restorative pot-au-feu for the nutty front legs.', 'Bourride', 'Bourride, the classic cloudy seafood stew of Provence (a Pernod-free cousin to bouillabaisse) is skimmed and strained into a clear-as-vodka consommé. It tastes of concentrated ocean and salt and sun-baked algae. You use a ladle to retrieve more broth from a Mauviel copper pot, which you pour over a delicate slice of black bass. You spoon a swath of aioli into the soup, dampening the littoral funk, but stinging the palate with garlic.', 'No ile flottantes or oeufs à la neige grace the dessert menu, and rightly so, as such ethereal creations would be redundant with the savory quenelles. But throwbacks abound here, from a rice pudding like any other, to a rarely seen chiboust —\x80\x94 stiff pastry cream atop cherries —\x80\x94 to a vertical take on mousse, with infinite shavings of dark chocolate rising above the fluff like an accidental mille feuille of black truffles.', ""Le Coucou doesn't blow you away in in the same way that experimental Brooklyn spots like Olmsted do, nor does it intend to.

154,"['Eater critic Robert Sietsema celebrates a spot for refined Indian dishes.', ""\n  Over the last decade, restaurants in Manhattan’s Curry Hill have been gradually inching upscale, so there aren’t quite as many cheap options. This transition has raised the bar. The neighborhood offers better-quality food and more regional Indian cuisines than ever before. The latest evidence of this trend is Sahib, a name that's a term of respect derived from Arabic. Sahib is the sixth in a group of restaurants owned and overseen by chef Hemant Mathur, though it was originated by Bollywood actor-turned-restaurateur Shiva Natarajan, who remains a consultant. The restaurants include \r\nDhaba, Chote Nawab, and Haldi in Curry Hill, Chola in Midtown and Malai Marke in the East Village. \n  "", 'Sahib offers dishes from all over India —some well-known, others more obscure —but its heart remains in the north, especially in Punjab, the state adjacent to Pakistan where much of New York’s Indian steam-table fare originated. Rest assured that at Sahib, it has been extensively reworked. But Sahib also pushes north into Kashmir, ""like Shangri-La beneath the summer moon,"" as the haunting Led Zeppelin song describes it. The menu receives its greatest inspiration from that land of mountains and mists.', 'In contrast to the animated décor of other restaurants in the chain, Sahib’s dining room is relentlessly staid and buff-colored, decorated with many small round mirrors in white sunburst frames and inlaid wall treatments that run from whitewashed lath to pale ceramic tiles. A meal begins auspiciously with an amuse: a slender glass of soup to fend off the winter chill. On one occasion it was pumpkin, on another yellow split peas scented with cardamom.', 'Not as well-known in Western cooking, fenugreek, with its earthy, aromatic flavor, is encountered again and again.\xa0Murgh methi malai ($16) — a recipe from Punjab — features chopped light- and dark meat chicken in a creamy sauce shot with fenugreek leaves (known as methi in several Indian languages). Another fenugreek-intensive dish comes from across the border in Kashmir: methi maaz drops a substantial lamb shank into a greenish sauce seasoned with the fresh leaf. If no one is wearing perfume at your table, you can smell the shank coming across the dining room.', 'In Kashmir, curries are frequently thickened with yogurt, fresh cilantro crowns most dishes, and saffron is sometimes used with abandon.', 'Made with tender chunks of long-braised lamb in a yogurt sauce flavored with cumin and caramelized onions, rogan josh ($17) is the cuisine’s signature. Back home in Kashmir, this dish and many others, including ground-meat kebabs and ginger-laced chicken curries, are incorporated into a festive platter called wazwan, which often serves as festival and wedding fare.', 'Engagingly, Sahib plays fast and loose with several wazwan components. Hare mutter ki shikanpuri is often a grilled patty made with ground lamb, but here green peas and fresh paneer cheese are substituted for the meat, and the fritter is pan fried. Delicious! Other regional dishes are similarly transformed. In palak paneer, a Punjab staple, a slurry of flavorful spinach is surmounted by browned balls of ricotta, suggesting a nascent Indo-Italian cuisine. Similarly, Banarasi eggplant, from the northeastern Indian city of Varanasi on the Ganges River (famous for its burning ghats), is improved by loading the familiar vegetable curry into a smoked eggplant skin. This is cooking genius — reverent toward the original recipe, but willing to alter it in a way that is both contemporary and scrumptious.', 'Other unforgettable highlights include gobi hari mirchi ka khurchan ($14) — minced cauliflower cooked with green chiles and tomatoes, making the vegetable seem almost like a dairy product; and curry patta jhinga — grilled shrimp skewers coated with a paste of curry leaves and coconut, a recipe originating in the southernmost state of Kerala. Anything to be avoided? Well, yes. The crowd-pleasing classic chicken vindaloo proved not nearly as sour and spicy as it could have been.']"

And the highest-profile iterations on the drink come out of corporate chains like T.G.I. Fridays or Applebee's. The mojito is not in fashion, and that's a large part of what makes it fit so well at Guantanamera, a thrillingly unfashionable Cuban restaurant in Midtown West.\n  "", 'When you order a mojito at Guantanamera, the bartender does not scowl at you.

It is not clean, like so many of today's perfectly emulsified, overwrought tipples, strained through wire mesh with the same urgency that a French chef might bring to clarifying veal stock. The drink's deep flavors comes from all the pounding, prodding, and shaking of previously attractive ingredients. Drifts of smashed lime and bruised mint float about in what looks like a glass of cloudy pond water."", ""Some sips of Guantanamera's mojito taste heavily of rum. Others taste of mint that's more grassy than sweet. Still others taste of lime that's more pithy than bright.

But I can tell you about Juan de la Cruz, a man who\'s prominently featured on Guantanamera\'s website, and who\'s the first person you\'ll see in the restaurant on a Friday or Saturday. He\'s not the host. He\'s not the bartender.

The result is something like warm, tender jerky, with a musk so beefy and powerful it\'s delivered with a wedge of lemon or lime. Matched with the traditional rice and beans, it\'s easily a one-plate meal for two. Same goes for the picadillo, a big pile of raisin- and olive-studded ground beef with an egg on top, and the ropa vieja, the iconic dish of slow-simmered flank steak and peppers that\'s tender as cotton candy.', 'The palomilla steak is tempting; at its best, the preparation involves tenderizing a cheap cut of top round by slicing it thin, marinating it in lime and garlic, and quickly cooking it over high heat to a sizzling crispness. But what the kitchen puts out here is just a thin, underseasoned, overcooked steak. Chicken Guantanamera, by contrast, is excellent: a crispy half bird drenched in a world of garlic sauce. Lechon asado (slow-cooked pork) exhibits the type of soft flesh and heady aroma that can keep hunger at bay through a one-hour rumba set, or longer. It arrives with boiled cassava, drenched in garlic butter.', ""Guantanamera is proof that there's still a rich restaurant world beyond those glittery places with PR campaigns or viral Instagram love, that those restaurants can find ways to remain crowded ten years after opening.

He’s right, but the relatively high cost of dinner at Tuxedo shouldn’t distract from a larger truth: Diners have been willing to spend more at good Chinese restaurants in Chinatown and greater Manhattan for a long time.', ""I'm talking about old-guard hangouts like Shun Lee Palace, Peking Duck House, and the live seafood temple that is Oriental Garden, as well as at more more modern restaurants like Fung Tu, Decoy, Hakkasan (yes, it’s still open), and the Asian-American stoner’s banquet hall that is Mission Chinese. That stadium-sized Buddakan and Tao are among the country’s most trafficked restaurants highlights how expansive a notion New Yorkers have of what constitutes Chinese fare, how much they’ll pay for it, and whether such venues are cool enough for a few hits of BYO birthday cocaine (why not?)."", 'It’s this love of high-end Chinese food in all its awesomely evolving forms that lets a venue like Tuxedo thrive. And in case there’s any worry about an Australian owner and a Scottish chef swooping down onto historic Doyers Street with a restaurant that looks straight out of Sex and the City, let the record state that on a recent Saturday patrons were spilling out of neighboring Nom Wah Tea Parlor (the famed dim sum house) and Joe’s Shanghai (a historic spot for xiao long bao).', 'It’s this love of high-end Chinese food in all its awesomely evolving forms that lets a venue like Tuxedo thrive.', 'None of this makes it any easier to pay a little bit extra for a dish. XO noodles, typically a $5 street snack, run $25 at Tuxedo. Here’s why: Homemade egg fettuccine, which replace the traditional rice noodles, get waxed in nothing more than savory seaweed butter. It’s as if Donnelly is preparing them for a shaving of truffles. And he more or less is, except in this case the aromatic addition is a regal XO sauce: A funky, almost furry chutney of shrimp and (very non-traditional) speck with an evanescent complexity that could rival tartufi bianco.', 'Sichuan eggplant is an easy candidate for dish of the year. The aubergine doesn’t really provide any mala tingle — nothing really does at Tuxedo — but the dish still delivers, thanks to a clever trick: Donnelly laces his batter with xantham gum and pipes it out of a whipped cream canister. The wizardry transforms the vegetable into the nightshade equivalent of a pommes souffle, except these ethereal batons pack the sugars of a sweet plantain. Donnelly employs the same aeration technique for sweet and sour pork, chewy little knobs of swine fried in a wafer-like crust — a neutral conduit for the sauce’s agrodolce tang.', '[Clockwise from the top left: Crispy skin squab; chicken liver; beef tartare; and whipped cream with strawberries and yogurt]', 'Donnelly is quick to admit that some of these touches – like adding fish sauce and kaffir to beef tartare – aren’t precisely Chinese, though any particular dish never feels any less Chinese than say, the Sichuan spaetzle at Fung Tu or the Kung Pao pastrami at Mission Chinese. Such gyrations are precisely what one might expect from the longtime chef at Ms. G’s, a heralded pan-Asian fusion spot in Sydney, and from a man who once said in an interview that he wants his legacy to be ""known as an Asian White Boy.""', 'Does Donnelly riff too hard on the classics? Sometimes. The Hong Kong-New York staple, beef and broccoli is reimagined as pastrami-cured tongue with broccoli relish; the sweet, vegetal tones of the latter ingredient are invisible. The good news? It’s still wicked good, with green tomato that cuts through the funk of ox tongue. Mapo tofu is less of a success. Reinterpreted as a porky bolognese, an aggressively salty ragu that reeks of a Sichuan peppercorn is heaped over thin noodles, yet again, it lacks mala.', 'Tuxedo gives other standards proper due. Stir-fry chicken ($25) is a fine study in the sugars of oyster sauce, the gentle absorptive capacity of yuba, the toothsome Maillard of well-cooked fowl and the warming heat of black pepper. It’s nothing revelatory, yet it’s well-executed fare that tastes great over rice (an extra $5, so that’s $30) and washed down with a beer. Steamed sea bass with ginger and soy, a life-changing treat at Oriental Garden, is less enthralling for a minuscule portion that’s $38 dollars — even if it is expertly cooked.', 'More good news: Tuxedo’s red meats wouldn’t be out of place at a Michelin-starred house of game. Sliced duck, incorrectly listed under the salad section, exhibits a tenderness and level of rendered fat that’s straight up Daniel, while fresh lychees mimic the delicate softness of the animal flesh. And then there’s the squab – not since Babbo has New York encountered a pigeon preparation this exciting! Handsomely bronzed, the quartered pigeon balances notes of sweetness and musk as adroitly as lamb, with a texture so delicate that filet mignon would be tough by comparison. You dip in it a sugar-laced salt and you eat it with your hands like a barbecue-sauce slathered chicken wing at a summer picnic. Pick up the head and, with as much confidence as you would with a shrimp, suck out the soft, earthy brains.', 'Desserts are worth the visit alone. Steamed tofu topped with granola, a cloud of soft soy hidden underneath a layer of crunch, is the type of dish I wish the owners served in their vegan coffee shop next door. And whipped cream with strawberries and yogurt is aromatic bliss, a freeform ode to shades of red and pink in varying degrees of ice, fluff, and fruit.', 'Then you look at the check. And you conclude that beef tartare really should come as a free amuse bouche. But you show up a week later and you order it again. I suppose these boys are onto something!', 'Cost: Expect to spend about $100 or more per person. Snacks at $3.50 (single oysters) to $15 (chicken liver).

157,"['Even as Gerardo Gonzalez adds proteins to former El Rey menu', 'When El Rey opened late in 2013 on a hardscrabble stretch of Stanton across the street from the punk-rock venue Arlene’s Grocery, it was mainly a coffee bar. Chef Gerardo Gonzalez, who’d worked previously at the General Greene and Goat Town, was put in charge of developing a baked goods program, because what good is a latte without a slice of quick bread? As summer approached, the windows were flung open to the Lower East Side’s warm breezes and Gonzalez started experimenting with salads and savory dishes, eventually adding them to the menu. Soon, the tiny place was mobbed with a crowd that seemed mostly models and food writers. I found myself meeting friends there for lunch upwards of once a week.', 'The strictly vegetarian food was simple but spectacular. It was made-to-order by the chef himself, who chatted up the regulars as he cooked behind a counter at the end of the room. I remember a dish called avocado del sur, which provided slices of the pale green fruit on cut pitas, blotted with an even greener chimichurri. Topped with pink pickled onions, its clash of colors knocked your socks off. An equally surprising salad featured chicharrones de harina (a pig-skin substitute), while a chia-seed pudding glowed red and white with pomegranate and freshly shaved coconut. And there was, of course, a killer kale salad that boosted the reputation of that mid-decade obsession. Rarely had good-for-you food been quite so appealing.', 'In 2016 the bearded and mustachioed chef from San Diego left El Rey, vowing to start his own restaurant. He traveled to Europe and Mexico first, then opened Lalo in Chinatown, supplanting what had been a battered but much-loved karaoke tavern. Though the layout remained the same — with a bar to the left of the entrance, and a line of tables on the right — the color scheme was extensively brightened, and the fake Tiffany lamps, red Naugahyde booths, and shabby beer signs banished. Now there are semicircular banquets that glow yellowish-orange, kitchenette tables with metal chairs, and a mortise that looks into the scullery, where Gonzalez can be seen squinting as he surveys the room.', 'To his arsenal of vegetables, fruits, and grains he’s added chicken, fish, and red meat. This may disappoint some vegetarian devotees, but it has only served to sharpen the chef’s technique and sense of whimsy. Since the opening last November, the menu has changed considerably as Gonzalez continues tinkering. His trip to Mexico has paid off in cumin lamb barbacoa ($17), a rich red broth dotted with dark shreds of meat and creamy masa gnocchi — one of the chef’s most spectacular inventions. A roast half-chicken arrives laved in a bright cilantro sauce, reminding us of the chef’s affection for the color green. Later, pineapple would enrich and sweeten a revamped sauce.', '[Clockwise from the top left: Caesar salad; cumin barbacoa with gnocchi; boquerones tostadas; and baby steak]', 'Indeed, it often seems that half the things on the menu feature green as the predominant color. A holdover from El Rey is a vegan Caesar salad ($12). Cunningly, it substitutes brewer’s yeast for anchovies to achieve similar umami. Equally verdant is a ""brown goddess"" cucumber salad dressed with mole and mint that doesn’t quite work (the dressing might as well have been balsamic vinegar). You want wacky? A couple of crazy apps fill the bill. One is a bar snack of dehydrated chile-coated strawberries and rose-flavored peanuts that came one evening in a soap dish shaped like a lady taking a bath. I defy you not to like this app, even if the flavors remind you of Palmolive. (Hence, perhaps, the serving vessel.)', ' I defy you not to like this app, even if the flavors remind you of Palmolive.', 'Another crazy menu item is a bread dip made from white beans zapped with squid ink that turned the dip black. This is intellectualized cooking at its finest, but at some point you’ve got to wonder, wasn’t the black-bean dip that inspired it good enough already? On a menu studded with interesting notions, one of the finest is the miniaturization of the expensive steakhouse steak. Many have had the experience of going to a steakhouse, plunking down $75 or so, and getting more steak than you could ever eat or fully enjoy. For $15, Gonzalez offers an assayable portion of New York strip: 3.5 ounces of dry-aged meat sliced and topped with crunchy and spicy hazelnut oil. Really, even that quantity is enough to share between two people, proving that eating steak is all about concentrated bovine flavor, rather than sheer quantity.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two starters or vegetables, one side, and two meats or mariscos, with two cocktails, and tax but not tip, $125.', 'Sample dishes: Vegan Caesar salad, black bean dip and chips, cumin lamb barbacoa, papas bravas, baby steak, toasted kasha salad', 'What to drink: A wealth of drink options are available, including aquas frescas (homemade non-alcoholic sodas); wines in six categories, of which orange, jerez (sherry), and bubbles are three; beer; cocktails; and punches.', 'Bonus tip: Miss El Rey?

158,"[""Eater's senior critic awards three stars to the new restaurant from the Maison Premiere team"", 'Taking its cue from 19th-century New Orleans oyster houses, Maison Premiere debuted at the end of winter 2011, prying open 20 varieties of raw bivalves and washing them down with Champagne and absinthe — which was all the rage five years ago, still cloaked in an aura of subversive semi-legality. The concept was simple and brilliant, and the premises were perfect in an icy and backward-looking sort of way. ""This is Bedford Avenue?"" The masses gasped, as lines wove out the door and down the street. Eventually, the place evolved into a more conventional seafood restaurant, featuring crudos, chowders, whole-fish entrees, and the sorts of premium-priced raw and cooked seafood one finds stacked in towers in Paris or Provence.', 'Sauvage (""wild"" in French), the second restaurant from the team of Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka, with Lisa Giffen once again serving as chef, set down on the Greenpoint frontier a few months ago. Though sporting a formidable French wine list, it focused more on food than drink. Sauvage spread itself along Nassau Street like homemade butter on the cumin-scented warm roll that is one of the restaurant’s most delicious apps ($2.50). Across the intersection lies McCarren Park, where the crack of the baseball bat punctuates a leisurely meal, at least for those who choose to perch at the outdoor tables. Over your shoulder you can see Five Leaves, the wildly popular gastropub above which the ghost of Heath Ledger still hovers.', 'Sauvage is made for long summer evenings.', 'While Maison Premiere seemed a winter retreat, Sauvage is made for long summer evenings. Inside find a barroom with a white-marble bar and a scatter of small tables on one side; on the other a dining room with black-and-white photos, wood-framed mirrors, and a collection of potted plants that it must take someone hours to water. Leather banquettes and bent-cane chairs provide seating, and illumination is furnished by chandeliers with tulip-shaped Art Nouveau shades. ""This seems much more like fin-de-siècle Vienna than Paris,"" a photographer friend exclaimed one evening as she ran her eye around the room, and then contemplated with pleasure the vegetable-intensive menu.', 'That bill of fare is divided into five sections by size and dish composition. In a tip of the hat to the more comprehensive raw bar at Maison Premiere, the menu begins with a mini-section that includes a single oyster service, queen crab in brown butter, and a pair of bright red Carabinero prawns tendered on ice with thick saffron aioli ($14). Those who hate to peel and eat will skip the prawns, but they’ll be missing some very striking crustaceans. The regular appetizer list shows some of the creative verve that characterizes the chef’s best work, including a finely diced fluke crudo in a whitish fluid that turns out to be whey.', 'My favorite app – apart from a delightful corn-and-chanterelle soup that’s just the thing to cool your throat on a sweltering evening — is the leek terrine ($13), rubbery planks of precisely the same dimension bound together with gelatin like sticks of gum in a pack. The terrine arrives deposited on juice-soaked whole-grain bread. To help you identify just what kind of juice, tiny manila clams are also seen rolling around the plate. The dish seems pure whimsy on the part of the chef, putting a smile on the face of every diner who orders it.', 'Indeed, the chef everywhere shows her enthusiasm for garlic.', 'Despite the plethora of vegetarian apps, there’s also a bonus section called Vegetables that is even larger and more meatless. Highlights include a shallow bowl of stuffed and poached vegetables called petit farce (there’s that sense of whimsy again), and a crunchy dish of sunchokes, croutons, and garlic scapes that produces one of the most powerful garlic punches of the season. Indeed, the chef everywhere shows her enthusiasm for garlic. Sadly, a couple of vegetarian offerings don’t quite work, including a carrot carpaccio featuring the thin-sliced commodity prettily plated, but a real chore to chew.', '[Top: the pig head for two. Bottom: pork chop and prawns]', 'Especially if you’re a vegetarian or like to eat more lightly, you could do very well sticking to the small dishes. But some of the menu’s wilder and heavier conceptions are found among the main courses and shared main courses. From the former find an entire lobster ($28) packed into half the shell, making the poached flesh seem more profuse and opulent than in a normal plating. Atypically, it comes with a heap of buttery mashed potatoes, and even more atypically, with a bowl of sweet and rich pig’s blood sauce on the side! (This is not as bad an idea as it sounds.)', 'For the two-fisted meat eater, there’s a pork porterhouse ($31) drowning in herb butter like a good steak, perfectly cooked to a mild pink and set off with bok choy and pickled rhubarb. This is as good a piece of meat as you’ll find in Greenpoint — unless you’re in one of the neighborhood’s fast-disappearing Polish butcher shops. A hake entrée ($23) garnished with an assortments of shellfish, proves less interesting compared to the pork porterhouse, but provides another bridge to the cooking of Sauvage’s tamer predecessor, Maison Premiere.', 'Perhaps the strangest thing on a menu filled with pleasant surprises is the pig head for two ($65), served with creamy white beans. Wearing a smile and tanned like a Miami retiree who spends too much time on the beach, the face wiggles and wobbles on the plate. A probing fork will find vast expanses of meat, fat, skin, and connective tissue. It’s good, I guess, but this is probably the last thing you want to eat on a humid summer night in Greenpoint.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two apps, a shared pig head (or two regular entrees), and a bottle of wine, with tax but not tip, $160', 'Sample dishes: Red Carabinero prawns, leek terrine, grilled asparagus with cured egg, pike with sour beer sabayon; for dessert, a stone-fruit tart with lemon custard filling.', 'What to drink: The nearly all-French wine list covers much territory, including lots of sparkling wines, whites, roses, and reds — among which particular bargains are to be found in the Loire and Languedoc.', 'Bonus tip: Perfect bargain summer fare is to be had by filling up on the bread, picking a couple of vegetarian apps, and washing it all down with a cider or beer.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including two apps, a shared pig head (or two regular entrees), and a bottle of wine, with tax but not tip, $160', 'Sample dishes: Red Carabinero prawns, leek terrine, grilled asparagus with cured egg, pike with sour beer sabayon; for dessert, a stone-fruit tart with lemon custard filling.', 'What to drink: The nearly all-French wine list covers much territory, including lots of sparkling wines, whites, roses, and reds — among which particular bargains are to be found in the Loire and Languedoc.']"

160,"[""3 stars for chef Greg Baxtrom's ambitious, approachable Prospect Heights stunner"", 'In this cramped culinary era, a time when the de facto waiting room for a hot restaurant is often the empty restaurant next door, the smart people running Olmsted — where the bar, as it is at most restaurants, is filled with diners, not drinkers — have something a bit more comfortable and convenient in store: They send early arrivals to the backyard garden.', 'Walk through the restaurant and you\'ll find yourself in a true backyard. Six outdoor benches are arranged in a large U shape around the perimeter, the type of seating plan that tasting menu spots construct around an open kitchen. (""The cooks are the entertainment!"") Here, the benches are situated in a tiny urban farm. Patrons sit on fabric cushions, sipping orange wine and noshing on fried pickled fiddlehead ferns or puffy crawfish chips, watching fireflies glow a bioluminescent yellow. At Olmsted, the garden is theater. The raised beds around the benches are covered with a carpet of greenery so thick and soft it\'s a wonder folks don\'t try to slip the staff a $50, take off their shoes, and lie down amid the vegetation, a pastoral analogue to tipsilly wading through pool at The Four Seasons.', 'There are no tables out here; the garden is for snacks, cocktails, dessert, and sweating. It is 80 degrees on a summer night. A soft breeze blows through, and Japanese hand fans are scattered about for additional relief. A quail walks to and fro in a coop at the back of the yard. They\'re kept for their eggs. ""We don\'t slaughter them,"" a waiter reassures me, unprompted. I want to respond that I\'d be okay with it if they did.', 'NY Grass-Fed Bavette (top); Watermelon Sushi', ""In heat like this, it's tempting to invert the usual order of things and kick off an evening's festivities with something cool, something sweet, so I order dessert. A server ferries over a small ceramic bowl filled with white fluff adorned with flowers. Half of each spoonful is delicate, ethereal, honeyed, aromatized with lavender. This is whipped cream. The other half is cold, dense, and sour. This is frozen yogurt. The dish, as well-balanced as any of the more savory starters, is a monochromatic study in temperature and texture: It's nearly impossible to tell which of the two ingredients you're eating until it's actually in your mouth. It recalls Heston Blumenthal's iconic Hot Tea Cold Tea, a preparation where the two distinct beverage sit in a single glass with no barrier. Rarely in cuisine have cognitive dissonance and color been used in concert to such brilliant effect."", ""The garden, the wine, the great-tasting intellectualism — it's the type of outdoor epicurean bliss you might expect to encounter at one of the country's most expensive culinary establishments. And yet at Olmsted, a modest storefront restaurant in Brooklyn's well-heeled Prospect Heights, most dishes are under $20. Credit due to Greg Baxtrom, a chef who's spent time working at venues where $800 meals for two are not uncommon — Stone Barns, Atera, Alinea, Per Se — for giving New York one of its most paradoxically ambitious yet most approachable restaurants. After just three months in business, Olmsted easily joins the ranks of Estela and Wildair as one of the city's best and most creative small-plates places."", ""Olmsted's watermelon sushi, for example, is the type of nigiri Masa Takayama wished he were serving at his $598-a-head temple to raw fish. Baxtrom takes thin slices of Long Island fluke and paper-thin rounds of confit lemon, wraps both around pinky-sized sticks of the crimson melon, and finishes it all with fleur de sel. The sugars from the fruit, when mixed with the tart citrus and the high-end salt, electrify in the mouth; it's like a high end Sour Patch Kid."", 'One of the secrets to that watermelon sushi is a thin layer of herb oil, infused with clippings from the restaurant\'s garden. Ian Rothman, Baxtrom\'s partner in the 50-seat endeavor, oversees the backyard farm, and if the food here wasn\'t so good you\'d roll your eyes at his bio. Rothman was the horticulturist at Atera, where (as Olmsted\'s website explains), he ""oversaw the restaurant\'s subterranean garden and living wall."" All those who reckoned that a more pared-down spot like Olmsted might be deprived of its own living wall (let\'s stop using that phrase): Fret not. Rothman has constructed a mosaic of green stuff that spans the length of the interior portion of the restaurant.', ""The garden is in use during service, too: I watch a chef go out back to snip off some greens, perhaps a bit of lovage for the chawanmushi. The kitchen fries it up with spring garlic shoots and arranges the mixture atop of the delicate dish. With just a tap of your spoon they crackle and crunch like autumn leaves. Now take a bite: Summer truffles impart a whisper of woodsy funk, the garlic shocks the tongue with bitterness, and the soft, savory custard resets your palate with just a touch of sweetness. It's a $16 appetizer, but it wouldn't be out of place in a multi-hundred-dollar kaiseki menu."", ""It's almost too good to be true. Isn't it?"", ""Olmsted's backyard garden"", '""An affordable neighborhood restaurant is what we want,"" Baxtrom wrote to me via email. And while Olmsted\'s pricing scheme accords with that statement, the caliber of food he\'s serving makes things just a bit more complicated. Your typical neighborhood spot doesn\'t command two hour waits on a Friday. The more accurate way to consider Olmsted might be as a destination local restaurant. It\'s a venue that fills a need in the immediate community — Prospect Heights has plenty of casual weeknight spots, but no real history of haute cuisine — and yet it also ends up attracting a city-wide crowd — likely to be national, once word gets out.', 'A destination local restaurant presents a dilemma, as adulation and accolades (not to mention suddenly impossible-to-get-tables) tend to change a place. A prime example was the December 2007 issue of Bon Appetit: the powers that were decided to give the cover to the meatball sliders served at the Little Owl, an affordable West Village haunt that was already pretty packed every night. It was a seminal moment for small restaurants, many of whom had been living in the shadow of the Buddakan-style big box behemoths that arose in the late aughts, and a presager of the post-recession return to more intimate dining.', ""Carrot Crepe (top); chef Greg Baxtrom at the pass; Olmsted's interior"", ""In the end, the hordes came and went, and the Little Owl remained true to itself; it's more or less the same charming restaurant now as it was before its spotlight moment in 2006. But not all restaurants weather the attention so unchanged. When another destination neighborhood spot, NoLiTa's walk-in only Torrisi Italian Specialities, started to attract fans thanks to its affordable set menu, it slowly raised its price from $45 to $100, and then beyond. What began as a welcome antidote to fine dining became yet another expensive — albeit excellent — practitioner of the art."", ""None of this is to deny a good restaurant the chance to capitalize on its fame and evolve over the course of its lifespan. But in an era with so many operators pushing the tasting menu hard, it's heartwarming to see Olmsted take a more populist approach to ambitious gastronomy (Baxtrom tells me he has no plans to ever go prix-fixe only). It's also exciting to have another outer-borough pole holding up the city's high-end dining scene, which has spent the last decade spreading slowly (arguably too slowly) outward from Manhattan."", ""To put Olmsted's prices in perspective: A bottle of well-balanced orange wine runs $30 (a Manhattan venue could easily charge twice that). And the steak entree is $23 — a dollar more than a pizza at Franny's a few blocks away. That steak, by the way, is flawless: It's a grass-fed bavette that's silky as Japanese Wagyu; it delivers not a dry-age funk but an obscene beefiness. Baxtrom changes up the accompaniments depending on the season; when I dined there, he amped up the bovine factor with a tiny squash filled with a ratatouille that was a bit muskier than usual, thanks to a layer of beef short rib."", ""Fans of the atavistic appetizer-entree-dessert format might argue that Olmsted's servings are a touch small even by small plate standards. I'll counter that I've never tried anything here that isn't large enough to share. For a proper meal for two, you'll want to order about seven dishes — six shared savory plates, one dessert — plus a bottle of wine."", 'One thing that should not be shared, however, is the carrot crepe. This is a preparation so fantastic it deserves to be enjoyed in full, on first and subsequent visits, without fear of having a companion steal a precious morsel.', ""Olmsted's carrot crepe is not what it seems. It looks like a typically fussy salad, atop an orange disc dotted with flower petals. Then you rip through this decorative facade with your fork. Beneath lie soft little neck clams (or sometimes surf clams) and a rich yellow carrot jus infused with the flavor of the sea. Your palate is overwhelmed with butter and brine. Baxtrom has reimagined linguine with clams through the lens of a root vegetable, a French crepe, and the colors of a sunflower. It's stunning."", ""But as cutting edge as Olmsted is, it wouldn't be a proper 2016 restaurant if it didn't offer an agrodolce cauliflower, the current reigning version of which is gobi manchurian, a sino-subcontinental snack that involves turning the plant into a vegan riff on General Tso's chicken. Baxtrom goes more refined with an analogue called gobi pakoda; the fried romesco choufleur isn't drenched in neon goo, but rather sits adjacent a curried gastrique that's nearly as dark as a demi-glace. A candy-like sweetness hits you first, then a tamarind tang, then a wallop of heat from jalapeño."", 'Scallops, the throwaway entree of the past 15 years (""Maybe we should sear them?"") find a new relevance by being threaded on skewers and grilled over charcoal, with a wicked coating of deeply flavored pasilla chiles. Some of the mollusks are firm and cooked through, others are charred on the outside and enjoyably jiggly within; just when things threaten to get too salty, a mess of creamed corn, cooked in the style of risotto, resets the palate, its sweetness an early foreshadowing of dessert.', ""Follow those up with the sublime steak or a roulade of guinea hen, at $24 the most expensive large plate, though good enough that I'd happily pay double that. The bird's gamy white meat is rolled around ramp mousse and roasted, sometimes creating the visual effect of a yin and yang when sliced. The sweeter, funkier thigh meat is doused under a swathe of foamy ramp hollandaise; searching for the morsels with a fork evokes a Michelin-starred riff on bobbing for apples. (Baxtrom says all the manipulation allows him to squeak out three instead out two portions out of each hen, helping him keep the price low.) Finish it up, then give up your table (if you like; there's no pressure from the elegant service team) to walk back outside for dessert.

My theory was that if the food had been better, people would have gone only to eat. But keeping the food at a certain low level, everybody went for conversation and meeting people and chatting, and that was the success of the place.""', ""Vandal is not the moneyed literary salon that Elaine's once was. It attracts a different crowd. Glittery people with last names like Hilton, Kennedy, Matisse, Kardashian, and Strahan have all partied here, under the faux-decanter light fixtures.

These spots traffic in a more expansive style of consumption than one that's strictly gustatory in nature. Years before Carbone sold the experience of pairing $65 chicken parm with Jersey-accented waiters who sing on Saturday nights, the Tao Group's blockbuster Lavo hawked spaghetti with Kobe meatballs while the club downstairs hosted bikini brunches."", 'Then there is the Tao juggernaut itself, a trio of hot spots in Midtown, West Chelsea, and Las Vegas, where the diverse foodways of the global East are diluted down to overpriced Red Bull, wontons, and Wagyu.

The food ranges from awful to passable, but I\'ve found that sitting on Tao\'s candlelit staircase while overlooking the 24-armed Buddha statue is as surefire a way to impress one sort of date as cocktails at Bemelmans is another.

Its size, prices, and population density seem likely to earn it a few dollars of its own. And it has its own approach to storytelling fun.

Vandal celebrates the art, architecture, and food of global street culture from New York to Vietnam to Barcelona and beyonddfsdfsd [sic].""', ""Their web editor might have fallen asleep at the keyboard, but that part about art and architecture is true.

Now here's what you actually get: a single dense ball of spiced ground lamb, sandwiched within a slaw-stuffed baguette. The menu says the dish includes foie gras, none of which I detected. This two-bite travesty costs $8, which is more than what you ought to ever pay for an entire banh mi, a single meatball, or a solitary slider."", ""Vandal doesn't want its food to be bad. If it did it wouldn't have hired Santos, of Stanton Social as well as Beauty & Essex, one of the least worst Tao Group restaurants. (The venue famously pours free sparkling rose in the ladies' room. Depending on your point of view, it's either generous or insidious.) Santos' food has always trended somewhat gimmicky, but during my meals at Beauty & Essex when it opened half a decade ago, I remember a chef serving delicious, ambitious fare, from a solid lamb burger to a Wagyu carpaccio dusted with seaweed, amping up the umami of the beef."", 'At Vandal, Santos smears beef tartare over a hot pretzel, resulting in hot mush. The menu is ""inspired by street fare from around the world,"" the restaurant\'s website asserts, a statement that raises the question of what precisely is ""street"" about a two-pound lobster scampi that costs $68.', ""Inspiration, of course, doesn't mean replication. And there's nothing wrong with luxing up cheap eats. But the source has to be believable. And when it comes to elevating the price, the actual culinary art of refining such fare should play as much a role in the calculus as the tax on eating it in a chic, high-rent location. This gets to the heart of why Vandal doesn't quite work: The Tao Group sells a story about global street fare, but fails to deliver on that story."", 'Take the fish tacos. Vandal takes an small amount of (expertly cooked) Chilean sea bass and overwhelms the delicate fish with a mess of slaw. Cost: $24 for three tacos. Consider the rice balls. Vandal calls the under-seasoned creations ""cacio e pepe arancini,"" and uses a side of parmesan dipping foam to command a $15 price. How about paella? It\'s not really street food, but that\'s the least of Vandal\'s problems. The dish contains no soccarat - the life-alteringly wonderful crust of rice that forms at the bottom and edges of the pan, packing in all sorts of complex flavors —\x80\x94 instead, it\'s just mushy rice with chorizo and chicken.', ""A modicum of credit is due for the adventurous spirit, though. Most sceney establishments pooh-pooh trendy fare in favor of tried-and-true classics, but Santos's kitchen embraces modern food culture, their menu riffing on the sort of thing Anthony Bourdain and crew will likely show off in their giant West Side food hall opening up next year. Sometimes it really works: Dishes like glutinous rice cakes or octopus huaraches are absolutely brilliant; the former act as a pleasant conduit for a spicy broth, while the latter is all soft cephalopod and pure corn bliss. Even the mini-ramen, a small bowl for $9, packs firm noodles and a wallop of smoky, bacon-laced dashi."", ""But when dollar churros cost $16, it's hard not to be a little cynical, to wonder whether Santos and the Tao Group really think of Vandal as a restaurant, or as a forum to poke fun at modern gastronomy, a chance turn their guests into unwitting participants in a parody on what it means to eat out in 2016.

162,"[""3 stars for Marco Canora's virtuous revamp of an East Village classic"", 'Really, twelve dollars for broth?"" my companion asked as we looked over the menu at Hearth, Marco Canora\'s twelve-year-old restaurant in the East Village. In 2016, the determination of value when it comes to a restaurant dish is indeed a complicated affair. But can a person really put a price on a miracle elixir?', 'In his ossiferous opus Brodo: A Bone Broth Cookbook, Canora writes about broth the way some epidemiologists write about the polio vaccine. He reverently describes how his savory potions of bones and spices brings joint relief to arthritis sufferers. He explains that the hot, marrow-laced liquid helped him become a calmer, more peaceful man, thanks in part to the ""gut-brain connection."" Take or leave these psychological, biological, and religious claims, but lord in heaven, that brodo is Hearth\'s best dish, and I\'ll pay whatever Canora asks for it.', ""It starts with turkey, chicken, and beef bones, which have the shinola boiled out of them until they've fully disintegrated. Canora then adds turmeric, black pepper, and marrow, and ladles your serving into a aqua ceramic bowl, which you're instructed to pick up with your hands and drink from directly. The bronze-brown liquid smells of dry-aged beef. The collagen makes your lips stick together. The peppers warm your throat. It doesn't exactly whet the palate; rather, it snaps the senses back into focus after the dulling effect of the short walk in 10-degree windchill that brought you to the restaurant's door. This is, ideally, how you begin every meal at this brick-lined, dimly-lit neighborhood gem. It is transportive."", 'But not too transportive. Coming back to life, aided by this rich broth, you see Momofuku overlord David Chang sitting in a corner booth; he\'s eating butter-drenched gnocchi perfumed with sage leaves. You hear the late, great Ol\' Dirty Bastard crooning on the sound system: ""Ooh baby, I like it raw."" And you realize you\'re here, in the East Village. You are at Hearth, a restaurant that is as awesome as it\'s ever been, even though it is, as of two months ago, an entirely different restaurant.', ""Cured pork belly with marinated fennel (left); Hearth's updated interior"", 'Hearth opened in 2003 as a partnership between Marco Canora, the opening chef de cuisine at Craft, and Paul Greico, the goateed former wine director of Gramercy Tavern. (Greico left in 2014.) The cuisine was seasonal, Tuscan-inspired American fare, with intricate charcuterie boards, hearty ribollitas, earthy mushrooms, filling bollito mistos, and lush ribeyes for two.', ""Things were great. Until they weren't. Over the years, Canora saw his rent rise by 65 percent. He was overweight. He was diagnosed with gout. And as guests who've sat at his chef's counter can attest, when things didn't go right in the kitchen, he occasionally did his best impression of Gordon Ramsay, shouting and cursing at underperforming cooks."", 'But according to Canora (who has recognized me on every single visit I\'ve made to his restaurant), he managed to turn his health around, curb his temper, and keep his business afloat, thanks to — well, thanks to soup. He started hawking the stuff (he calls it ""brodo,"" a nod to Hearth\'s Italian influences, though it\'s more commonly identifiable as bone broth) out of one of the restaurant\'s window in 2014. The Today Show aired a segment. Epicurious called it the new coffee. The New York Times compared it to the other haute addictions du jour, coconut water and green juice. People came in droves.', 'Then in early 2016, Canora closed Hearth for a week, nixed traditional appetizers and entrees on the menu in favor of au-courant share plates, expanded the offerings to better reflect the healthful, nutrient-dense ethos of his beloved brodo and, in the end, debuted a slightly more comfortable room to match the resulting slightly higher cost of dining.', 'This isn\'t a ""they replaced Shea Stadium with Citi Field"" renovation. Changes are subtle. Only regular guests of the old Hearth will notice the changes. The bar up front, formerly slate, is now jade marble, and the chef\'s counter is now butcher\'s block (I\'d happily sleep on both). There\'s a long, soft leather banquette along the north wall, and the old rust-red ceiling is now painted an airy white. The pendant lamps might be new, but the lighting is still gentle enough to flatter your paper-thin radishes served over buttermilk, the gentle fats of the dairy softening the spice of the kaleidoscopic roots.', 'Canora has long championed a narrative of enlightened gastronomy. Bar coasters at the original Hearth were emblazoned with Depression-era government mantras: ""Save what will keep, eat what will spoil."" At Hearth reborn, Canora doubles down on that ethos. The back of the menu is printed with a 13-section mission statement that touts a ban on ""lions of the sea"" (swordfish, for example, is off the bill of fare); pledges support for the local greenmarket over the allure of ""certified organic""; champions fresh fats (""we change our fryer oil every day""); and encourages everyone to eat offal, by way of a cute little story about a cheetah slaughtering a gazelle for its bloody organs.', '""In the simplest terms, we only use meat from happy, healthy animals,"" reads the menu, a statement that would come across as a bromide if not for a more compelling truth that Canora doesn\'t publicize: The chef doesn\'t like how many young calves are weaned on powdered milk, and so Hearth has, for the time being, eliminated veal from what might be its most famous dish, the ethereal ricotta meatballs, which are now made with beef.', 'Another rule: ""We mill our own flour and polenta from intact, non-GMO, heirloom varieties."" Canora, true to form, puts his money where his mouth is. He cracks his own rye berries for for a red-cabbage-topped porridge (he calls it ""risotto"") that boasts the the texture of coarse polenta and that explodes with the flavor of caraway seeds. He grinds whole grain for toothsome homemade rigatoni, dressed with a pork ragu whose deep flavors linger like mole. And he breaks down buckwheat for pizzoccheri - short, earthy tagliatelle that stand up to stinky, stretchy fontina and heady mushrooms better than standard-issue semolina pasta ever could.', ""Hearth still sells its famous gnocchi, which dissolve in the mouth with all the ease of pommes purée. Just one tweak: Canora switched to a local, small-production outlet for his all-purpose flour. And the butter coating those gnocchi, like all of the restaurant's cooking butter, comes from grass-fed cows, a pricey product that elsewhere might only be reserved for formal bread and butter. These under-the-hood changes contribute to the moral integrity of the revamped restaurant, and they also have a noticeable impact on a salient part of the Hearth experience: dining here now, you'll likely spend more than you would have last year."", 'Spanish mackerel with cipollini onions, potatoes, and shellfish cream (left); the Variety Burger', ""No, the old iteration of Hearth wasn't cheap, but the new version is downright expensive. Small plates add up, and it's likely that a proper dinner for two will exceed $100 per person after tax and tip. But it's worth it; the price is in line with the high quality of the food that Canora and his chef de cuisine, Luigi Petrocelli, are sending out. (The better deal, for those willing to give up a bit of control, is the six-course, $78 tasting, drawn from the a la carte menu.)"", ""Still, some of Hearth's portions are tiny even by small plates standards. A crispy-skinned cod square served with kale is, improbably, as indulgent as collards with ham hocks, but you're paying $26 for a fillet that's not much bigger than a deck of playing cards. Mackerel, illogically served in a bowl (please don't serve things that need to be cut in bowls), with an almost invisible layer of shellfish cream, delivers about three flawless bites of deliciously oily flesh for $21. Better bang for your small-plate buck comes in the form of pork belly, shaved like carpaccio under a rainforest canopy of fennel. It's a modestly sized plate, and with good reason: too much more of this salty, herbaceous bliss and the palate would go utterly dead."", 'Among the heartier portions are the pastas and grains, including the very good bread service, which is no longer complimentary, nor should it be. Three large slices of Sullivan Street sourdough arrive with a trio of dips: grassy butter, fruity extra virgin olive oil, and smoky whipped lardo from, to borrow Canora\'s words, ""good clean pigs."" A generous portion of carrot and beet tartare never seems to end, perhaps because the bland creation doesn\'t pack the same complexity as the foie gras or trout roe-laced versions at Little Park or Semilla. Instead, try the tart grilled cauliflower over a mash of smoked, shredded trout, a functional one-plate meal for $16.', 'But the king of Hearth is cow. There are no traditional steaks on the menu, so you get your bovine fix from a few weighty slices of beef neck. The meat is braised, but the cow\'s grass-feeding (and barley finishing) means the lean cut has a heft that\'s closer to a firm filet mignon than it is to the short rib of a more conventional corn-fed steer. The flavor is concentrated, and doubly so when you drink the clear ""sauce,"" which isn\'t a reduced braising liquid but rather — there it is again — Canora\'s beef brodo.', 'And then there\'s the burger. So often, the burger is the most middle-of-the-road item on a menu. Here, it\'s among the most challenging offerings. The ""Variety Burger"" is a medium-rare patty made from a coarse grind of brisket, chuck, heart, and liver. It\'s served with sweet potato wedge fries (heresy!) and without a bun (hiss!). The lack of bread means there\'s nothing but a slice of melted fontina and a heap of caramelized onions to soften the organ meats\' clean, ferric blow. It is, without a doubt, the biggest risk a New York chef has taken with a hamburger since Daniel Boulud stuffed one with foie gras and truffles over a decade ago, and it\'s easily one of the standout dishes of the year.', ""Desserts, from fried apple donuts to the dark chocolate board (which feels like a gourmet market raid), are great, but they don't wow the same way the brodo or burger does. And it's hard not to feel a swell of nostalgia for Grieco's wacky, annotated wine list and its epic Riesling selections. (There are still tons of Rieslings on offer, though only one by the glass.) Still. Canora deserves credit not just for turning his health around, but for keeping a neighborhood mainstay open and relevant in a city that eats up and spits out so many young venues a year in — let alone a dozen.

163,"['A particularly lush feijoada awaits', 'The feijoada at Via Brasil is an absolute delight. Considered the national dish of Brazil, it’s really more of a set meal of several components, providing an explosion of colors and flavors. Sure, feijoada originated in Portugal, and each former colony from Mozambique to Macau has its own version, but never has it been carried to such heights as in Brazil, and rarely has New York seen such a lush rendition.', 'The dish is a dense stew of black beans seething with pork and beef parts, something like French cassoulet. Some meats are smoked, some fatty, some fibrous, and others you simply won’t be able to identify, though if you dredge up a curly morsel, it’s probably pig tail. Crumbly? Blood sausage. The superiority of Brazil’s feijoada derives from its African influences, which perfectly complement the European ones.', 'Brazilian expat families survey the scene, whispering in Portuguese', 'There’s a bowl of shredded raw kale that glints and glistens with oil, looking like something available at healthy food mecca Dimes or By Chloe. Though it seems totally modern, the kale salad originated among the five million tribal Africans abducted to Brazil between 1501 and 1866. Ditto with farofa, a gritty condiment of manioc meal sauteed with bits of bacon. The final two elements are a saucer of orange segments (said to aid digestion) and a vast plate of white rice, which serves as a staging platform for everything else.', 'Founded in 1978, Via Brasil is located on a block of West 46th Street known as Little Brazil, which once boasted dozens of restaurants, haberdasheries, shipping concerns, and variety stores selling South American goods. Now all that remains are three restaurants and a store specializing in bathing suits. Via Brasil is the best of the eateries, decorated with an old-fashioned opulence that includes swirling stone tiles in the front barroom, a white piano for Brazilian jazz performances, a profusion of parrots, and leather banquettes that trail into the stained-wood interior, where Brazilian expat families survey the scene, whispering in Portuguese.', 'Feijoada completa', 'With entrees in the $18 to $29 range, the place looks as expensive as a typical bistro-level restaurant, but instead of small servings devoid of sides, that price gets you massive plates of food with all the trimmings, so that you can barely contemplate apps or desserts. The single serving of feijoada ($27) feeds two, while the portion for two ($34), would do fine for three. Dating from the days when there were no churrascarias in town, Via Brasil also provides a menu of grilled meats, of which the assortment called Rio Grande delivers chicken pieces, a thick pork chop, a sirloin steak, and a smoke-laced sausage. At $27, there’s no better meat deal in town.', 'Instead of small servings devoid of sides, that price gets you massive plates of food with all the trimmings, so that you can barely contemplate apps or desserts.', 'Other impressive repasts include vatapa, an Afro-Brazilian assemblage that consists of a big hunk of fish and handful of shrimp arranged on a thick porridge of bread crumbs and coconut milk colored bright orange with dende (palm oil). Back home, the dish would probably be spicy as hell, but here flavorings are toned down somewhat, which does not prevent deliciousness. Served with a yuca puree, muqueca camarones (shrimp stew) is another Afro-Brazilian delight here rendered in stately and restrained fashion.', 'Many main courses reflect the country’s European heritage from Portugal, Italy, and even Russia. You might try bacalhau a Gomes de sa, a delectable casserole of dried cod, spuds, and onions that tastes like Lisbon; bife a parmigiana com spaghetti, a breaded Milanese cutlet smothered in cheese that one might find on nearly any menu in the world; and strogonoff de frango, a cream-and-cognac-laced chicken rendition of a czarist classic. Soon after Spain and Portugal conquered the South American continent militarily and politically, Italy and Russia did so culinarily.', 'Pao de quiejo and churrasco on a stick', 'You don’t really need apps, but while your party is waiting for mains to arrive, you might happily munch on a shared serving of the restaurant’s signature salad, which includes oranges and hearts of palm. Also recommended: pao de quiejo ($6), the little Brazilian cheese balls whose bouncy texture is a result of tapioca, the cod cake, or a simple bowl of the kale-bearing Portuguese soup caldo verde.', 'The bar sports a line of antique bottles of cachaça, the signature spirit of Brazil, where the population consumes 390 million gallons annually. Distilled from sugar cane, it tastes more like Italian grappa than Cuban rum. The unaged variety is best consumed in the lime-muddled cocktail caipirinha, and there are five or six cachaças available for that purpose.

Why should I expect everybody to understand yeast?', 'Ales and lagers are beer’s two main clans, divided by yeast.', 'So, a riff on my reply: ""Top-fermenting ale yeast favors warmer temps, creating fruitier flavors. Ales veer from dark stouts to bitter IPAs—India pale ale. Lager yeast is like microscopic Eskimos. It thrives in the cool depths, slowly toiling to create crisp pilsners, lawnmower chuggers, and strong doppelbocks. Also, lagers take longer to ferment;\xa0lagern means \'to rest\' in German.""', 'So much to digest! It’s why I rarely reference Brettanomyces, a genus of yeast that’s oft misunderstood.

Brett treats beer like an infinite buffet, devouring until scraps are picked clean. Its signature descriptors are ""earth,"" ""hay,"" ""funk,"" ""barnyard,"" and ""horse blanket,"" a turn-off to the average drinker.

Secondly, it’s usually used alongside standard brewing yeast, perhaps in conjunction with souring bacteria, creating a complex flavor stew. Utilized for primary fermentation, Brett acts differently, a supporting actor taking a star turn. The yeast creates flavors and aromas reminiscent of tropical fruit, rustic funk and a tart flash lurking behind.

165,"['Starches assume strange shapes at San Rasa', 'If you’re a geometry fan, San Rasa could be your new place. Every meal at this Sri Lankan restaurant is centered on some form of starch, cast as a handsome plate sculpture. Take hoppers, for example. One order consists of five pale pancakes that form perfect hollow hemispheres. For no apparent reason, one of the five has an egg cracked in the bottom, runny yolk intact. These curvilinear flatbreads made from rice flour and coconut milk are leavened with microorganisms that descend from the air, yeast, or sometimes toddy, a palm-based wine . The hoppers are crisp and creamy, and at San Rasa, you get to pick a bowl of curry to dip them in: beef, chicken, fish, lamb, shrimp, squid, or vegetable ($12 to $15).', 'San Rasa is one of at least six restaurants in Staten Island that represent the cooking of the Sri Lankan community there, which numbers around 5,000, mainly located in the St. George/Tompkinsville/ Stapleton neighborhoods, a pleasant 15-minute walk from the ferry terminal. The deep dining room is accented with paintings of ancient ruins, Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, and swooping wooden ceiling buttresses and beams that one fellow diner exclaimed, ""look like they came from a pre-fab kit to build a beach cabana."" A (liquor-less) bar flanks one side of the room, and a brick-lined nook at the rear provides a staging area for the Sunday all-you-can-eat buffet ($11.99).', 'So, what kind of curry goes with hoppers? Black lamb curry is a good choice, a signature of Sri Lankan cooking made by over-toasting the masala, a powdered-spice mixture. Exceedingly rich and flavorsome, the dark gravy provides the perfect dip for torn pieces of flatbread. Another nice selection is ambul tiyal, a tart fish curry. The recipe involves lime juice, chiles, ginger, and other flavorings; as with sushi, it originated as a method of fish preservation. Less satisfying in this context is San Rasa\'s plain chicken curry, which is a little too low on zing to complement the bland hoppers. (The name is said to be a colonial-era mispronunciation of ""appam,"" the South Indian term for the similar pancakes.)', 'Above: String hopper kottu with falooda. Below: Hoppers and pittu.', ""The pyramid figures prominently in chef Lalith Gunasakara's geometrical preoccupation. An elongated example provides the shape for kottu roti, a dish made by tossing torn and moistened roti fragments with a curry. Poised in the middle of the plate and strewn with parsley, it looks somewhat like the tree-dotted landscape around the Washington Monument. Here, shrimp or mixed vegetable curries are the ones to pick, making the pyramid as mellow as a Middle Eastern fattoush. Perhaps the most curious Sri Lankan starch of all is pittu: a ghostly white cylinder wrapped in a glistening banana leaf. Made from grated coconut and rice flour that's been steamed, the texture proves dry and crumbly, demanding a juicy curry to go with it. Pick fish."", 'Other starches include string hoppers, something like rice spaghetti, and godamba roti, which features a thin, flaky flatbread wadded like a brown hanky, and a series of flat packages (egg roti) served alongside a curry (once again, your choice!). The menu presents two further curry sections, and these can also be paired with any of the starches, or with a squat cylinder of white rice. One curry collection includes chicken cashew, beef and potato, and, less appealingly, chicken broccoli; another exclusively features seafood, reminding you that Sri Lanka is an island nation.', 'Lamprais and San Rasa exterior.', 'Also on the frankly bewildering bill of fare are various ""devilled"" proteins (stir-fries with peppers, onions, and ginger; some of the spiciest things on the menu and a bit sweet), biryanis in profusion, and a vegetarian section —\x80\x94 though meatless options also inhabit the other pages.

Unfold the pillow-shaped package and discover a fried boiled egg, a heap of yellow rice, a sambal, a curry or two, a vegetable mélange, and a fistful of cashews, which soak up all the other flavors.

Outside, ten aspirants, plus a baby in a stroller and a black labrador, wait for the host to text with good news. I overhear one of their conversations: ""Is avocado toast a thing in Canada?""', ""Inside, natural light pours through giant windows overlooking Hudson and Horatio streets.

It is without question, one of New York's finest carnivorous options, and the platter itself rivals an English breakfast in its calorie content and deliciousness factor."", 'Kulp took an unconventional approach to opening his New York restaurant. Rather than kicking off with dinner and then waiting for the reviews to pour in, the venue debuted with breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and then added on nighttime hours a month later. High Street, in other words, was almost instantly an all-day brasserie, a risky move for such a young venue.', ""Of course, staying open throughout the day can help any young restaurant meet its financial obligations more quickly. At least, theoretically. The downside can be enormous: higher labor costs if guests don't show up (there's no captive hotel audience here), greater opportunity for errors amid the increased offerings, and a staff that will almost surely be overworked, no matter how deep the bench of cooks and waiters."", ""And yet, High Street pulls off the all-day experience with aplomb. No, the 60-seat spot doesn't quite have the space (or the wifi) to act as a true third space between home and work, the type of venue like Lafayette or the lobby at the Ace where four-tops can drop by for coffee only and end up spending an entire Saturday afternoon typing away on their MacBooks. But you can usually snag a stool behind High Street host stand and spend an hour or two during a slow lunch sipping a cortado and reading the paper. And for those who are skeptical about the usefulness of an institution where the brunch waits can exceed an hour, consider this: a dedicated takeout counter gets patrons in and out in under 10 minutes, even during peak hours. Not even a busy bodega can always accomplish such speed."", 'The ""daily breads and spreads"" platter', ""So if the queue drags on, pick up a cinnamon raisin bagel to go, saunter over to the High Line (a three-minute walk), and enjoy the super-chewy, naturally leavened treat on a bench while gazing out over the Hudson.

Another clutch choice is the sliced turkey: The kitchen cooks the fowl so gently and cuts it so thin it practically dissolves in your mouth like pâté. Is it as compelling as the original honey-marinated version from Torrisi Italian Specialties, where Kulp worked as chef de cuisine for years? It sure comes close."", ""As the afternoon sun dims and High Street switches to dinner, attention in the restaurant turns away from the sumptuous windows and back toward the room itself.

Such a dedication to the craft of leavening is a true luxury in this era, when so many in-house bakery and pastry programs have been on the chopping block, an easy operation to cut in the face of rising costs."", ""On Saturday, a bowl of samples sits on the takeout counter; they're cubes of anadama bread, a New England-style deli loaf forged from cornmeal and molasses.

Those petals, as it turns out, are lobster coral; the kitchen shapes the roe and shaves it like truffles. The taste is pure shellfish and ocean water, intensified by a factor of a hundred.', ""There are heftier mains, too, that don't quite deliver in the same way — a somewhat spongy sous-vide beef here, a too-sweet honey glazed chicken for two there.

In fact, it deserves to be counted among places like Indian Accent, Babu Ji, and Tapestry that are lately heralding an Indian dining renaissance in New York City.

The food is reasonably priced and of surprisingly high quality. Whether the star attraction is sublime pizza or a sustaining noodle bowl or a brilliantly engineered sandwich, the dish mesmerizes with its craftsmanship and expressiveness. Beyond the accomplished service and remarkable food, these restaurants possess an ineffable sense of community and place.

More recently, Easton paired the complex torchietti, a pasta made with curvy, ridged twists of dough, with simple, reassuring walnut and spring onion cream sauce.

But for both flavor and price, the pastas are the undeniable scene-stealers."", ""Easton's mastery and affordability have propelled Il Corvo to local cult status. He deserves it. This is the kind of animated, community-minded restaurant I wish for every neighborhood in America. That said, I've visited a great deal of neighborhoods in the past few years, and I've never come across any place quite like it."", ""Il Corvo began in the same way as a number of new independent projects by chefs: as a permanent pop-up. In 2011 Easton was working as executive chef at Seattle's Lecosho, a restaurant where entrees like New York strip with braised kale, fingerling potatoes, and chanterelle-leek ragu goes for $33. Easton longed to spend more time with his young family, and after a trip to Italy he'd begun geeking out on pasta-making. He obsessed over the recipe proportions and started acquiring the antique rollers, spindles and extruders used to shape the dough into endless forms."", 'His friend Brian Garrity owned Procopio Gelateria in Pike Place Market; Easton had actually pulled espresso and scooped frozen treats there in 1999 when he first moved to Seattle. After leaving Lecosho, Easton approached Garrity about renting space in the gelateria for his pasta experiment.', 'From the start, Easton\'s plan was to serve only lunch. ""I was crafting more of a lifestyle than a restaurant,"" he said by phone. ""I don\'t mind getting up early. And crafting pasta is such a pursuit —\x80\x94 I love the artistry and figuring out which forms work symbiotically with the sauce.""', 'Juggling three butane burners, an electric pasta boiler, and the occasional gelato order, Easton ran his pop-up on the thinnest of shoestrings. But his masterful pastas became a sensation with local critics and diners, enabling Il Corvo to open in their current space on a steep hill in the Pioneer Square area in January 2013.', 'The exterior of Il Corvo.', ""These days Easton and his crew crank out 250 to 300 portions of pasta every shift. And they're slowly building what might be the country's most humble restaurant empire. Il Corvo's success enabled Easton and longtime employee Johannes Heitzeberg to open a second restaurant, Pizzeria Gabbiano, in late 2014. The concept specializes in thin, Roman-style focaccia topped with combinations like capicola, caramelized onions, and fennel fronds. Like Il Corvo, Gabbiano is also open solely for weekday lunch, and a meal there is efficient and uplifting: We put it on Eater's inaugural Best New Restaurants list last year."", 'Easton is also gearing up to retail his pastas, since customers at Il Corvo have been asking about buying noodles for years. This summer he plans to open a pasta shop with 10 or 12 daily options and sauces to match. An Italian pasta drying cabinet is currently en route to Seattle.', ""Happily, no empire-building distractions show through at Il Corvo. Easton is still there around 6 a.m. every morning, gauging the weather to determine if the day's customers might prefer warming pasta e fagioli or uplifting tagliatelle with pea shoot and almond pesto. And then he gets to work."", ""Il Corvo is notable first and foremost because the pastas are soul-stirring and eloquently fashioned. But Easton's cooking also keeps returning to me because pasta culture around the country has stretched to polar extremes. In its infinite variations, the dish is rendered as either a quick hunger stopgap prepared without much finesse, or serves as a blank slate for upscale showmanship involving uni and caviar and shaved truffles. Il Corvo returns pasta to its place of essential goodness. The restaurant turns dough into happy-making strands and whimsical shapes. Beautifully pitched sauces balance acid, freshness, and heft."", ""Maintaining pasta's core simplicity while treating every aspect of the dish with respect did more than bring good Italian food to the neighborhood: it created community. A lovingly made pasta lunch is both so obviously satisfying and so uncommon that there's a sense of lightheartedness in the room. I've noticed no one seems overly fidgety or cranky in the line. For pasta this winning at $9 a pop, a little wait feels acceptable. Portions seem spot-on, not heaping but certainly not skimpy. (And hell, if you have a big appetite, get two pastas. The cost would still be less than the pasta dishes in many tonier restaurants.)"", 'The service further fosters this sense of community, both in its warmth and efficiency. A sign near the entrance details the rules of etiquette: ""Order at the counter. Select a seat AFTER YOU\'VE PLACED YOUR ORDER. Bus your own table. Enjoy your lunch."" The brusque wording may have offended some customers early on, but the directives did their job: the place has a rhythm that works. Once you\'ve paid and your lunch is ready, an available seat is never long in coming. Most of the tables are four-tops, though I\'ve noticed groups with empty chairs often invite solo strangers to join them. It\'s a thoroughly democratic shindig, with people of all backgrounds and occupations crammed into the rectangular room.', ""Il Corvo reflects one of the most hopeful facets of our current restaurant culture, where skill, quality and price all meet to serve a city. When friends visiting Seattle ask for restaurant recommendations, I invariably send them the link to Easton's blog, where he dutifully details each day's pastas. That list sells them, and when they go they can't believe the energy, the prices, the deliciousness. Locals and travelers alike tell me they return for lunch over and over. In a city with so many compelling restaurants, I'm tempted to encourage variety. But honestly, when I'm in Seattle, I too join the line for Easton's pastas over and over again.""]"
169,"[""One star for the celebrity chef's sprawling new Chelsea Italian restaurant"", 'The last time Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich opened a New York restaurant outside of a supermarket was eleven years ago, in 2005, long before there was ever a Marea, a Santina, a Great Recession or even an iPhone. Back then, Batali and Bastianich were the top players in Manhattan’s white-hot Italian renaissance, and their newest establishment, Del Posto, would go on to become one of the city’s most heralded culinary establishments.', 'But in the decade that followed, things changed. Batali and Bastianich had brought New York into the era of regional Italian fare, but the evolution kept going: from the haute red saucery of Carbone, to the quirky ""Cheesus Christ"" pizzas of Roberta’s, to the wood-fired lamb steaks of Lilia. The landscape has evolved, which makes the question of La Sirena, the latest Batali/Bastianich endeavor, a fascinating one. Can two of the city’s great Italian restaurateurs return to the forefront and wow us with a Tao-sized Italianate hangout, conveniently located directly above the actual Tao?', 'To be brief: They do not wow us. Del Posto was one of the most important restaurant openings of its era, but La Sirena is just another newcomer, another Italian restaurant that happens to serve a hamburger.', 'But the good news is that it’s a nice enough place to drink a daytime martini and pick at a plate of excellent rigatoni carbonara while watching all the pretty people on an al fresco terrace that alone is more than twice the square footage of most New York restaurants. Who are we to protest the pleasure of that? Tao, after all, isn’t open for brunch.', 'La Sirena is just another newcomer, another Italian restaurant that happens to serve a hamburger.', 'Like its downstairs neighbor, La Sirena is located in the Maritime Hotel. There are plenty of ambitious hotel restaurants in New York, but La Sirena isn’t trying to be one of them. In case there’s any doubt about the gravitational forces exerted by Mario Batali, the lower Chelsea/upper Meatpacking neighborhood, or the Maritime Hotel itself, let me clear things up: At any given night at La Sirena, a restaurant spanning the length of a full city block, with 210 indoor seats and a hundred more outdoors, the whole place is packed. Patrons dress as if they’re going clubbing after they finish their sugar-dusted bomboloni (made by former Le Bernardin pastry chef Michael Laiskonis), clad in leather pants, leather jackets, leather dresses with leather epaulettes, and see-through blouses.', 'This crowd is primed for $23 vodka cocktails, and they’re readily available. A bartender mixes Absolut Elyx (""the world’s first true luxury vodka""), with sloeberry gin, cocchi Americano, and dry cider, and pours it into an ornamental copper pineapple that you can, if you’d like to recreate the experience at home, purchase for $98 on the Elyx website. You pick it up with a firm grip, because the entire concoction feels as if it weighs six pounds, and you sip, via a metal straw, a liquid that evokes the sensation of putting your face over an alcohol-filled humidifier. The drink is a triumph for vodka as a neutral spirit, but a failure as a cocktail that will cost more than most late-night cab rides. I sampled it alongside an inconsistently butchered short rib carpaccio that, depending on the bite, exhibited the texture of perfect raw beef or of dry-aged Saran Wrap.', 'At La Sirena, which boasts a sweepingly curvilinear midcentury aesthetic, the soundtrack runs to the nondescript club bangers you might encounter at spin class, and the menu resembles that of a run-of-the-mill trattoria. Your cavatelli with pork ribs (blubbery and undercooked) or your linguine with clam sauce (microwave-quality) are both served tableside, a dramatic flourish that does nothing to improve the actual dishes themselves; the pastas are simply scooped out of a pan and dropped on a plate. We’re forced to watch as the servers dazzle everyone with their Vegas buffet tong skills.', 'Fried soft shell crabs with ramps serve as a phoned-in curtsey to the season, while a dish of baked clams, generally a way to intensify the mollusks’ tang through heat and butter, acts as a study in how to camouflage bland shellfish under too many bread crumbs. A server sternly warns the table about the intensely briny punch of a bottarga-topped plate of artichoke hearts, but his dehortations are for naught: The dish turns out to be as insipid as banquet-hall green salad.', 'Top: burger and braciole. Bottom: amatriciana ravioli.', 'Fettuccine verde is neither overcooked enough to be mushy nor undercooked to be al dente; it simply a caloric conduit for crumbly sausage bolognese. Better is the amatriciana ravioli, little dumplings of sweet tomato sauce and guanciale — they’re topped with verdant scallions, a nod to the Roman dish’s traditional onions. There’s the creative Batali that we know. The kitchen slathers caserecce pasta (a cousin to fusilli) with a gossamer coating of broccoli rabe pesto, chiles, and sesame, imparting the noodles with an assertively nutty and exhilaratingly bitter finish. And spicy octopus bucatini is an elegant essay in heat, tomato sauce, and soft cephalopod flesh.', 'Desserts, at the hands of pastry chef Laiskonis, are the only real showstoppers here.', 'Mains are about what one might expect from any restaurant anywhere in the city: meatballs over kale, chicken topped with peppers, sea bream with crispy skin. Just be sure to avoid the under-rendered duck breast with a carrot sauce that has all the complexity of Gerber baby food. And the brunch burger is an easy contender for one of the city’s lousiest new dishes. While Shake Shack sells a double patty stack with a gorgeous griddle char for $8.75, La Sirena uses onions, a potato roll, and mozzarella to mask two grey pucks that that have seen less salt than a communion wafer, served with under-crisped fries. Cost: $21.', 'Desserts, at the hands of pastry chef Laiskonis, are the only real showstoppers here, from the soft baba with its gently bitter Campari infusion, to the pignoli tart with its pecan pie-like texture, to the $19 brunch pastry basket with its collection of buttery kouign ammans and cloudlike cheddar biscuits.', 'Bastianich and Batali have always been shrewd with their branding choices. Lupa is widely recognized as one of New York’s finest Roman restaurants. Casa Mono is one of the city’s few Michelin-starred Spanish spots. Otto is a reliable place for inexpensive pastas and pizzas. And then there are the twin jewels of the duo’s New York empire: Babbo and Del Posto. In the timeline of New York restaurants, Babbo is an essential precursor to restaurants like Momofuku and the Spotted Pig, serving up some of the city’s most iconic and creative pastas, at relatively accessible prices, to a soundtrack of Eminem and Led Zeppelin. In his 2004 review of the restaurant, then-New York Times critic Frank Bruni cited Babbo’s choice of music (and the volume at which it was blasted) as a reason for withholding a fourth star from the venue. But the music never changed — and the crowds never subsided. Del Posto, in contrast, does not play Eminem. It boasts a grand piano, a grand marble staircase, and refined presentations available only as set menus.', 'Torta della nonna, salami cart.', 'The ovular blue-and-white pattern of La Sirena’s terrazzo marble floors is repeated on the tableware, part of an overall aesthetic that extends to the outdoor patio and even the iPad wine lists, specially designed to harmonize with the restaurant’s elegant motif. It’s too bad that brief nod to technology doesn’t extend to waiter-free drone ordering: Getting a drink when you’re seated at a table can require as much strategic patience as jockeying for a gin & tonic at McFadden’s during happy hour. Vespers and fennel margaritas (both of which are excellent) never seem to arrive until you’re three-quarters of the way finished with whatever you wanted to nibble on as you sipped them.Service as a whole ranged from passable to terrible during my visits; in this regard, La Sirena serves as an unwitting social experiment in how poorly New York diners will allow themselves to be treated in exchange for a seat at at a decked-out space run by a celebrity chef in a hip part of town. I watched a patron carry three cocktails as he walked from the bar to the lounge, a difficult task because most humans only have two hands; he passed by three waiters, none of whom offered any assistance. I almost walked out one night when, after being seated just after 10 p.m., a server didn’t ask what we wanted to order until nearly 10:30 p.m. On a Saturday at brunch time, I watched a waiter squirt green juice into shot glasses from a drippy squeeze bottle and deliver it as an amuse to every table but mine.', 'Of course, not every restaurant has to be Del Posto or Babbo. But coming from Batali, a restaurant has to be better than this. ', 'The salami cart, which regularly makes the rounds in the bar room to sell parmesan, olives, and cured meats, instantly appeared by my side on the night Joe Bastianich warmly greeted me at the door. I couldn’t tell you whether it’s because he recognized me, or because the staff is more on point when he’s in the house, but I do know that on other evenings, I was entirely invisible to the salami man.', 'I’m a regular at the bar at the majestic Del Posto, where I happily part with $100 for a plate or two of pasta and a few cocktails. And I dined at Babbo recently, and can confirm that nearly twenty years after opening, it’s as relevant as ever. Of course, not every restaurant has to be Del Posto or Babbo.

170,"['Three stars for the Prospect Heights restaurant', 'Consider the carnitas taco. The fresh tortilla underneath is the color of a new pair of blue jeans — and not the stonewashed kind, either. But the focus is a pile of pork tidbits known as carnitas. They’re emphatically not the dense fibrous cubes you usually get, but a soft, plump, moist, beige-colored heap that tumbles off the tortilla and onto the plate, tasting engagingly porky. In the Mexican fashion, the taco is finished with cilantro and sweet white onions, chopped so fine they almost fling off a mist. Three homemade salsas stand at the ready. This carnitas taco ($4) is easily one of the best tacos in New York City.', 'I first encountered those wonderful pork fragments late in 2013 with a phalanx of food writers who regularly shuttled up to the South Bronx to taste Denisse Lina Chavez’s cooking in a tiny bodega called El Atoradero. Later, there would be a small café next door, but at this time, a makeshift cauldron was set up in the middle of the bodega every Saturday. A bevy of neighborhood women — Salvadoran, Dominican, and Mexican — assisted Chavez by cubing the pork, perpetually stirring the pot, and performing such other tasks as hand-forming the picaditas — ridged masa discs tailor-made to hold the soupy carnitas.', 'When the landlord raised the rent on the short-lived café last year, after a bereft interval Chavez took her operation trans-borough. Open for about six months, El Atoradero Brooklyn is located on sloping Washington Avenue in Prospect Heights, on the downhill end of one of the city’s greatest concentrations of new restaurants. At about 6 p.m. the street throngs with strollers, as parents perch at outdoor tables to enjoy an early supper or a few cookies and a cup of coffee with their older children, just sprung from daycare.', ""Above: El Atoradero's sign.

The walls are painted with pineapples in a sort of brilliant DIY wallpaper, and the best table, raised high as if to accommodate basketball players, looks directly into the kitchen through a glass window.', 'What challenges Chavez must have faced as she thought about the promises and perils of the new location in a far more upscale part of town! Price rises, certainly, but would she go the route of chef Cosme Aguilar at Long Island City’s Casa Enrique, who created a bistro-ized menu featuring ceviches, composed salads, and showy regional dishes from his home state of Chiapas? Or would she stick with the same bodega menu from small-town Atlixco, in Puebla, that she had mounted in Mott Haven, keeping the full-meal prices in the teens, rather than offering entrees in the mid-20s, as Aguilar did?', 'She went the cheaper route, and thus the dining genre of El Atoradero nowadays might best be described as Enhanced Taqueria. Grab a couple of tacos and a beer and you won’t break the bank. Order an entrée, and you get a fully loaded plate at a bargain price. Many of the main courses are the same as those presented in the Bronx. There are meatballs stuffed with quail eggs, served in a zingy tomato sauce; a mole poblano more nutty than sweet, poured over cheese enchiladas or a quarter chicken; pork ribs and purslane in a green salsa more tart than hot; and — a weekend favorite back home in Puebla — great gobbets of the funky lamb steamed in banana leaves, called barbacoa. All entrees come with black beans and Mexican rice, with a basket of those enthralling blue tortillas upon request.', 'Above: Pork ribs and nachos. Below: Lamb barbacoa.', 'Alas, there are no picaditas to hold the carnitas the way there were in the Bronx — though we hear they may be made for you if you ask. But in addition to tacos, there are other antojitos that might hold them equally well, including quesadillas, burritos, tortas, and cemitas. You may scratch your head and wonder why a cafe mimicking the menu of a home kitchen in Puebla would offer such Americanized Mexican food as burritos, but this is part of the democratized feel of the place. This is crowd-pleasing Mexican food aimed at everyone. And also a utile place where you’re just as welcome to drop in for a sandwich or plate of nachos as for a full meal.', 'The list of taco fillings is long, comprising 12 choices. In addition to carnitas and barbacoa, best are lengua (stewed veal tongue), placeros de huevo (boiled egg), chicken tinga (shredded chicken in a spicy chipotle sauce), and verdolagas con hongos y nopales (purslane, mushrooms, and cactus). Of the short list of apps, the most interesting is an adapted version of nachos ($15 with meat, $12 vegetarian), featuring perfect blue tortilla chips in a humongous heap, and your choice of toppings from the taco list, which can lead to some pretty wild creations. Ever tried pig-ear nachos? The nachos come with a heap of guac on top, obviating the need to order it separately.', 'As the months have drifted by, a roster of daily specials has appeared, which are highly worth considering if you’re going the full-meal route.

The Mexican classic is ""so rich with Maillard-reaction goodness,"" Stupak writes, ""that a single bite can short-circuit your pleasure center and leave you in a speechless, slack-jawed twilight."" This porcine obsession, combined with the chef\'s birdie flipping iconoclasm, explains why Stupak has placed the humble street food, which rarely costs more than a few dollars, on his 21-course counter menu at Empellon Cocina, where dinner for two often exceeds $500.', 'It\'s a bold move. Even bolder: Stupak\'s version of this meaty treat contains no flesh, just achiote-rubbed pineapple and a few slices of lardo. Inverse al pastor is the name, making it perhaps the first taco to take its cue from the formal language of logic. ""A basic formula for creativity is to change the proportions,"" says the 35-year-old, who speaks in the tone one might expect from a Yale chemistry professor lecturing to a crowd of three hundred. Stupak, in this case, is speaking to four people.', '""Inverse"" al pastor taco with pineapple, cilantro, and lardo', ""He walks over to the rotisserie, palms a tortilla, presses it against the piña, and slices off a few shards of fat and fruit. He drizzles each taco with Christmas-colored salsas and cilantro. He places it in front of you as if it were a warm piece of sushi at Masa. And as you eat, you start to come to terms with the following: That the final savory course of an expensive tasting isn't a cumbersome protein meant to be cut with Laguiole knife but rather a fruit taco whose sauces are meant to dribble down your chin. That this Mexican-inspired affair is the only non-Japanese omakase where the primary utensils are your hands. That pineapple with lardo manages to be a more savory expression of what you've always imagined to al pastor to be. And that Stupak, the guy who hawks nachos on St. Marks Place and guac in the West Village, has earned a spot as one of New York's most exciting tasting menu chefs."", ""When a high-tech chef rides into town to cook for a night or two – be it Grant Achatz, Jordan Kahn, or Albert Adria – Empellon Cocina is frequently where the action takes place, and with good reason: aside from Stupak, there aren't a whole lot of modernist-trained chefs running their own restaurants in the Big Apple."", ""New York is indisputably one of the dining capitals of the world, but it's never really been a global destination for the type of experimental cuisine found in Barcelona (Tickets), Bray (The Fat Duck), or Chicago (Alinea). Our neo-classical city, with teems of bankers itching for protein-heavy client dinners, has a solid track record of sending avant-garde spots to the grave, from Varietal (mushroom desserts), to Corton (sashimi-stuffed cotton candy), to Sam Mason's Tailor (bubble gum cocktails and spherical veal), to WD~50, the Michelin-starred purveyor of pizza pebbles, knotted foie gras, coconut egg whites, and carrot juice yolks that employed Stupak as pastry chef for four years."", ""Perhaps the memories of a recession-era battering (along with rising labor costs) have prompted New York restaurateurs to channel more of their creative juices not into their cuisine but rather into their business models, with chefs toying around with no-tipping policies, lightly-staffed fast casual spots, and tiny stalls in epic food halls. Stupak's kitchen counter, accordingly, is not a separate restaurant, but rather four seats in the back of his East Village Cocina. Every spot is paid for in advance via the Tock ticketing system, at $95 for the 6 p.m. seating, and at $165 for the longer 8 p.m. seating. Translation: If no one shows up, the restaurant still makes money, and if no one books, Stupak still has a larger a la carte venue to run."", ""Empellon is hedging its bets here, and in exchange the guest is rewarded with the city's most intimate tasting experience: Stupak cooks for you, serves you, hands over a shot of leche de tigre right after you sit down. The clean, cold consommé of halibut, lime, tomato, and soy shocks the palate into action. And shortly afterward your tongue is set ablaze by a poblano pepper jelly, a dangerous surprise hiding underneath a tame panna cotta. There's your reimagined, retextured rajas con crema. "", 'Stupak issues a warning when things might get challenging. ""Everyone okay with grasshoppers?"" he asks, brandishing a chapulin-shaped serving piece filled with the namesake insect. They\'re not an uncommon ingredient in New York\'s Mexican restaurants, but at tasting menu venues, bugs are somewhat of a rarity. Stupak crushes them up with a mortar and pestle. ""They taste more like celery salt this way,"" he says, using the smashed remains to garnish a single bite of fried chicken wing. Delicious. But if you don\'t dig it, another course is minutes away, perhaps blood sopes anointed by heady boudin noir; both the corn cake and the sausage crumble in the mouth like a musky, offal-y brownie.', 'Celery root with chile ash mayonnaise and coconut crema; Poached oyster with nixtamalized popcorn kernels', ""The long tasting menu is key to creativity, a notion worth dwelling upon as the three Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park prepares to more or less halve its course count and quicken the pace of dinner. Shorter menus typically breed more conservative preparations – a chef has less room for error because of a higher price per course. Longer menus, by contrast, allow for more risk, as a dish that doesn't work is forgotten nine courses later. Stupak, to his credit, balances this gastronomic philosophy with the more pragmatic reality that people occasionally want more than a single bite of something. So instead of sending out a never-ending supply of wedding buffet-sized hors d'oeuvres, preparations grow and shrink throughout the meal, a little bit of palate teasing here, a hint of hunger sating there. A ten bite plate of celery root sashimi with coconut cream and chile ash mayo – an abstract study in black and white – is followed by a poached oyster topped with nixtamalized popcorn kernels – simple food that just tastes good."", ""Stupak isn't afraid to juxtapose modernity with tradition, refinement with rusticity. He sends out crispy quesadillas with string cheese and pork belly and a near perfect salsa with each ingredient chosen by one of the four guests (an haute stone soup). It all tastes familiar. Here's what's less familiar: Super Bowl party-worthy masa waffles with chicken liver butter, or a tiny mousse-filled puff whose magnified flavors of dairy and corn feel like a gordita-esque hat tip to golgappe, the yogurt-filled Indian street snack. Then there's the classic Oaxacan black mole, which comes not as a chicken smothering sauce but as a star ingredient in its own right, an inky ice cream whose warming spice contradicts its cool temperature. A plate of prune sorbet with agar agar spiraled chocolate ganache appears soon after – followed by orange sorbet in gossamer gellan gum tuiles (edible cones as thin as Saran Wrap) – and you start to wonder whether you're back at WD~50.

""That\'s the genesis and consistent point of inspiration but I want to be free. All chefs and artists I admire are free. Was the cooking at El Bulli really Spanish by the end of it all?"" He is correct. And as New Yorkers increasingly fly to Mexico City to splurge on elegant tasting menus (or spend $125 per person at Cosme in the Flatiron), they\'ll learn to dispense with the rosy eyed myths of authenticity and let Mexican food continue to do what cuisines hailing from countries with Michelin stars are allowed to do: evolve.

Dirty French on Ludlow sells $15 cocktails across from Katz's, a delicatessen where that much will get you a proper sandwich. Sushi Ko on Clinton offers $150 omakases next to discount nail salons and barber shops. WD~50, the tasting menu venue that introduced so many gourmands to experimental cuisine, closed to make way for $3 million condos, but a discount mattress outlet is still going strong across the street."", ""Lowlife, located just a block away from the old WD~50, embodies some of these high-low tensions within the restaurant itself; it's set in a space that at once feels like a chic neighborhood restaurant (see the obligatory wine bar, reclaimed wood tables, white pine walls) and a destination chef's counter spot (ten stools overlook the kitchen, equipped with eye-popping combi-oven and binchotan wonders)."", ""Order the yakitori chicken, one of the city's best new poultry dishes, and you can have a rustic meal for about $60 after beer, tax, and tip.

A solo diner can finish the $20 dish in about a minute."", 'Lowlife\'s butter-poached lobster boasts a higher level of tenderness and maritime tang than this somewhat ubiquitous dish normally does.

Ask your sommelier (usually Mazumdar) about this special.', ""3. At The Modern, Danny Meyer’s two-Michelin-starred fine dining establishment, Champagne starts at $20, service-included (Gremillet). At Lowlife, it runs $25, before tip (Pierre Gimmonet). The better value on Lowlife's sparkling list, by contrast, is the tart, apple-y, Les Perles de Montblanc from Savoie, France ($14). The softness of the bubbles match well with the guinea hen sausage."", '4. Expect four sherries by the glass, your standard selection of palo cortado, manzanilla, oloroso, and most notably a rare single vineyard fino from Valdespino ($10). The three ounce fino packs enough minerality and length to stand up to the black bass with maitake broth.', ""5. For those ordering Lowlife's rib cap steak, Bedrock's 2014 Zinfandel ($17) is a rockin' selection, with dark fruit that shines through amid the beef's fatty bliss, and with a restrained alcohol content for a Zin, at 14.4 percent."", ""Leonard deserves credit for making such haughty creations more accessible. (After all, it doesn't really matter if the longer menu is the better value if you can't afford it.) But a minuscule portion hidden behind a low price can sting just as much as a compelling luxury locked behind an exorbitant omakase. So if Lowlife continues to offer that borscht a la carte, maybe it might work better at $24 at twice the size."", ""Want hearty starters? Try the Hokkaido pumpkin, cooked down to the ethereal texture of soufflé. It acts as a sweet foil to buttery maitakes, oyster-laced salsa, and fish-sauce dressed radicchio. Guinea hen, whipped into a chile-laced weisswurst with its own skin as casing, is the charcuterie that Daniel Boulud wishes he were serving; the fluffy, meringue-like sausage soaks up a sauce of the bird's own drippings."", ""Starches, per the prevailing gastronomic zeitgeist, are rare here. Lamb bolognese ($20) was a filling pasta course earlier in January; too bad it's been removed from the menu. So you end up eating more protein (while trying to fill up on the bread course). And the good news is that Lowlife's pricier mains are more normally portioned."", 'The skin on a soft black bass fillet is crisped up with its scales intact, Guy Savoy-style, creating a three dimensional effect – all the better for soaking up ethereal aligot foam and earthy matsutake broth.

The premises seemed far older, as if it had once been a diner or soda fountain, with composite-stone floors, spaceship light fixtures, and twirling stools along a white-tiled counter. In those days it had a reputation for being the only decent place to eat within walking distance of the Javits Center. Still, despite an eclectic French and Italian menu (with some surprise Swedish twists thrown in around Christmastime), the food was hit or miss, and one was well advised to stick with the steak frites.', 'The last chef of Market Café, Giovanni Morales, decided to try to keep the declining institution alive with a different formula. Morales named the new version Oovah and adopted the concept of a wine bar specializing in 100 percent gluten-free food, with a small-dish format and a Latin theme.', 'Opening New Year’s Eve, 2014, the over-the-top décor had an improvised feel: You stepped through a blue neon frame into the restaurant to find yourself standing between a double row of potted evergreens. Up ahead, grape vines painted a ghoulish white hung in profusion from the ceiling; a scrim at the rear featured a time-lapse skyline of the city that rippled when anyone came in the front door. Spooky! The name ""Oovah"" occasioned some confusion, too: along with the odd lighting and décor — which still featured gleaming white tiles — it suggested an intergalactic fertility clinic.', 'Pollo guisado', 'So, by early summer, the place underwent an identity change. The gluten-free pretense was mostly dropped and the name altered to the cutesier Ooviña. Now publicity material and the spiel of the waiters imply that the food is largely Guatemalan, Morales’ country of origin.', ""Now there's a concept I can get behind: a wine bar with a Guatemalan theme. Unfortunately, while most of the food seems nominally Latin American, few of the dishes are identifiably Guatemalan. And they tend to be the best things on the menu."", 'Pollo guisado ($15), a tart and terrific chicken soup, sports a light tomatillo broth. A wealth of creamy, carby hominy lurks in the depths. Carne guisada ($15) might be its dark-haired fraternal twin, a beef stew with a lacing of cabernet sauvignon, a French flourish that the dish could well do without. The long-stewed tenderness of the beef cubes and the swollen rice at the bottom of the bowl are the real attractions here.', 'On a couple of occasions, the kitchen was out of pork tamales, another Guatemalan classic. Instead, a friend and I opted for arroz con chorizo, here spectacularly turned out with homemade jalapeño sausage and a soupçon of saffron. While one could have hoped for these Guatemalan dishes to be a bit earthier, one supposes that you don’t want the food to be too funky in any place that calls itself a wine bar. Anyway, the most purely Guatemalan dish is classified as a dessert: rellenitos colcocha ($12), fried ripe plantains filled with black-bean puree.

Pick one of its quirkier white, pink, or red varietals and you can’t go wrong. One night it was a glass of Garzon sauvignon blanc from Uruguay ($15), a crisp white with a fruity dryness, a perfect match for a shrimp ajillo that beds the pink crustaceans on a coarse garlic puree; on another occasion a sparkling Gruet Rose from New Mexico ($15) was low-key enough to let the delicacy of grilled baby calamari rings shine.', 'Other wines come from such diverse places as Israel, the Finger Lakes, Spain’s Basque country, Washington State, South Africa, Australia, and Chile. There are few bargains on the list, though at seven ounces per glass (I brought a measuring cup with me one evening), the pours are generous.', 'The balance of the menu is mostly Latin influenced, and the results vary. The cassava gnocchi ($13) in bacon gravy are quite wonderful; it’s a dish sometimes seen in Peruvian bistros. The extensive taco list is mainly forgettable, while the kale salad, while eminently edible, has no connection with anything else on the menu. One suspects it was mandated by the Food Police.

Give me crisp pilsners, salty-sour goses, or low-alcohol IPAs that make me work real hard to achieve inebriation.

Fact is, every drop of alcohol contains calories. Stronger beer? More calories! Weaker beer? Fewer calories!

Born in Germany at a time when all beers were dark by default, the centuries-old lager is an inky looker, initially mistaken for stout’s second cousin. Crack a classic like Köstritzer, though, and you’ll soon note that lightness lurks in the dark. Flavors of chocolate and coffee are offset by a bit of sweetness, the carbonation pleasantly fizzy, the finish clean, dry, and crisp. Better still, a smooth schwarzbier’s ABV often rides in around 5 percent (hello, moderation!), and the beer is friendly with burgers, roasted meats, holiday ham, and other hearty fare.', 'In short, a schwarzbier is my ideal everyday winter drink.', 'Photo via\xa0Facebook/The Brooklyn Brewery.', ""Lagers have long been the stock and trade of New York's\xa0Brooklyn Brewery, which debuted in 1988 with its eponymous Brooklyn Lager, a floral-fragranced amber brew that packed enough rattling bitterness to differentiate it from the country’s predominant, and pretty bland, lagers. In time, the brewery's stable expanded to a German-style pilsner, plus beers like East IPA, Brooklyn Brown, and Black Chocolate Stout, an imperial stout that deserves a pedestal as one of America’s best.

You’ll thank me in 2018.)"", 'The lager drinks incongruously creamy, almost like chocolate babka and a cup of not-too-strong coffee with one sugar.', 'As a Brooklyn dweller, drinking beer from the borough’s preeminent brewer was a rite of passage, right up there with ordering sandwiches through a bodega’s bulletproof window and prying discarded chicken bones from my growling dog.

It reads:"", ""Where do these meals come from? I don't deserve them with my own virtue. Putting down all the desires on my mind. Regarding this medicine to keep our bodies. We get it to complete the task of enlightenment."", 'At a glance, these phrases might come across as SoCal platitudes, postures affected by people who like their food clean and their protein shakes green. Buzzwords that reference mindfulness sell here in Los Angeles: The city has spawned a mini-chain of restaurants called Cafe Gratitude; juice bars refer to consuming their products as ""a ritual."" But the words on Baroo\'s wall come out of a very different tradition.', ""Baroo's chef and co-owner, Kwang Uh, is a native of South Korea; he culled the quote from an essay he wrote while studying at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Italy. The words are his version of a prayer he remembered from Buddhist ceremonial meals in Korea. He liked the intention behind the invocation, the reminder not to cling so tightly to ego, and wanted it to inform the vision for his restaurant. He conceived Baroo as a humble pursuit of these ideals — a small-scale, under-the-radar experiment, where he could hone his very individualistic style of cooking."", 'Noorook', ""The restaurant's short menu and mini-mall location belie the level of Uh's training; he has toured the planet in pursuit of cooking mastery. He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park in 2009, spent time afterward at Daniel in New York and the Nobu outpost in the Bahamas, and staged at restaurants like Noma and Spain's Quique Dacosta. He moved to Los Angeles last year and immediately jumped into running 16-seat Baroo, along with Matthew Kim, a childhood friend. It's just the two of them, cooking and serving lunch five days a week and dinner every night but Monday. They prepare around seven plates, $9 to $15 apiece, mostly grain salads and pastas. From these basic formats, they build symphonic raptures."", ""Take the dish Uh calls noorook. The name is a phonetic spelling for the Korean version of koji, the rice culture inoculated with the mold aspergillus oryzae that acts as a starter for things like miso, sake, and soy sauce. Uh blends the noorook with pureed roasted beets and cream, which he adds to a mix of pleasantly chewy grains —\xa0Job's tears, kamut, and farro — and then surrounds with a dizzying number of other ingredients: seaweed dashi, toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds, macadamia nuts, finger lime segments, and a few wisps of onion pickled with rose."", ""Basically, the dish is a mic drop on the done-to-death beet salad you'll find in nearly every restaurant these days. The koji is earthy sweet — almost mulchy, in the best possible sense. Everything else on the plate orbits around its glossy goodness, pinging sweet, citrusy, floral, and umami tastes that vary with every forkful. I felt not just sated after finishing it, but nourished."", 'As the koji (and those jars in the back) might hint, Uh has a thing for fermentation. Some fermented element makes a star showing on nearly every plate. Fried rice shimmers from the addition of a gentle, dulcet pineapple kimchi. Powdered sauerkraut gives an extra level of zing to a lush oxtail ragout clinging to homemade pasta.

Since opening last August, the restaurant has been labeled an ""avant-garde Korean fermentation health food restaurant,"" ""a taste of the future,"" and the place that is ""taking up the mantle of California cuisine."" I think those descriptions are true. But there\'s also something deeper about the restaurant that struck me personally — something I\'ve never sensed in quite the same way during my 14 years of writing about dining in America. Baroo comes across as an exercise in Buddhist practice.', '""Baroo"" is part of a longer Korean word, phonetically spelled baroo-gong-yang, which refers to the traditional Buddhist temple meals in Korea that includes a host of small vegetarian dishes, many enlivened with kimchi and other fermented foods; ""baroo"" refers specifically to the name of the bowl out of which monks eat their meals.', 'In my twenties, I was a serious student of Zen. I was kicking around the country in the mid-1990s, a little lost but not freaking out too much over it, cooking in restaurants to support myself and in my spare time meditating and teaching myself to write. These dual interests had been kindled when a friend had given me a book, Writing Down The Bones, by writer, teacher, and Zen practitioner Natalie Goldberg.', ""A foundation of Zen is the sesshin, or meditation practice period. It can last a half-day, seven days, or longer. It includes zazen (sitting meditation), kinhin (walking meditation), simple meals, and work practice. If this sounds relaxing, trust me when I say it is not. I sat a seven-day sesshin in Minneapolis once. Each day began before dawn and lasted well into the night. Adhering to the repetition and structure of the practice is one of the hardest things I've ever done. My body ached; my mind revolted a thousand times a day. At the end of the week, I felt like fistfuls of live wires had been pulled out of me and left in the open to sizzle. At the same time I felt exceptionally still and present — more so, honestly, than I've probably been before or since."", 'Gim', ""My second meal at Baroo transported me back to that feeling. I'd shown up for dinner, right as the restaurant opened on a Sunday evening. While Matthew Kim took my order at the counter, I could see Kwang Uh's straight back in the kitchen by the stove. His motions were certain, deliberate. He hustled but he stayed composed. Kim occasionally stepped into the kitchen to help, but Uh did most of the cooking alone. While waiting for my friends to arrive, I stood off to the side and watched him compose his bibim salad, a riff on Korean bibimbap. He covered a mix of quinoa, oats, and bulgur in a dressing of tomato and gochujang (fermented chile paste), drizzled an herb coulis around the plate, and buried the grains in an artful pile of shaved fennel, celery, radish, and other vegetables. And then he went on to the next task."", ""Obviously, that's the job of a cook: repetition, focus, consistency.

That quality of mindful presence comes through so clearly in Uh\'s cooking. In my time, I\'ve dined at a lot of restaurants run by various spiritual organizations, and rarely has the food come across as this alive and this delicious.', 'I asked Uh in an email if he considers himself a Buddhist. ""I might say half joking and half real that a two-staff operation is a great practice in lowering ego and connecting self to the Universe,"" he replied. ""If I have to say my religion, I can say I\'m Buddhist, but really I\'m the sort of person who respects aspects of every valid religion. Most of the Buddhists I know don\'t take Buddhism as religion but rather as a sort of life guide. That\'s why I\'m into it.""', ""Mindfulness doesn't mean perfection is guaranteed. I'd suggest going to Baroo on a weekday if possible, at the beginning or end of a shift, to appreciate the restaurant at its calmest. Uh stays composed in the maelstrom, but at its busiest the one-man kitchen can lag, and the wait times can be frustrating to customers.

Uh and Kim didn't at all anticipate their popularity or impact. It's one thing to craft a very personal expression of food with love and spiritual intention. It's another to churn out plates for hungry customers. For a while Uh seemed determined to keep the operation as only him and Kim. Recently he mentioned that he's likely going to hire at least one additional pair of hands to help out."", ""Despite its quirky nature, Baroo's success is hardly surprising. It speaks to so many of the zeitgeit's favorite culinary topics: vegetable-forward cooking, an interest in Korean flavors, the endless appeal of comfort food, the fascination with fermentation. Uh has managed to combine these things organically, into a holistic, ornate style that's all his own. Los Angeles is fertile ground right now for similarly tiny restaurants run by accomplished chefs who want to cook from the heart without enormous overhead. Jessica Koslow started a national breakfast sensation at Sqirl, whose seating comprised 10 stools around a counter when it opened in 2013. Former Patina chef Charles Olalia now crafts rice bowls inspired by his Filipino heritage at the seven-seat Rice Bar downtown. Miniscule restaurant Dune, in Atwater Village, redefines the modest falafel sandwich with its exquisite, richly textured interpretation."", ""Baroo is the most fascinatingly unconventional of them all. The spiritual inquisitiveness that comes through in Uh's approach differentiates it from restaurants that nail the trends but don't embody his unique search for connection. Baroo is a cutting-edge model for a restaurant — modest and ambitious and punishing, and centered around an ethos rather than a specific cuisine. Certainly its very existence, with the spotlight on fermentation and in the extreme dedication of its owners, is a testament to the art of transformation."", 'Perhaps it’s also untenable. The experiment might end at some point. Uh has hinted that he might close the restaurant after its one-year anniversary this summer and move on to something else. Given his resume, he seems prone to wandering. I’m hoping Baroo’s success might convince Uh to stay put in Los Angeles for a while. But who knows? One of Buddhism’s most famous truisms is that the origin of suffering is attachment. That’s why the subject of food shows up so regularly in Buddhist teachings: Eating is a daily lesson in impermanence.

Johnny Hash became a huge hit, leading SweetWater to uses the pungent resin in Hop Hash double IPA (7.8 percent ABV) and Hash Brown, a.k.a. an India brown ale (6.2 percent ABV). They’re great IPAs, gusting with all the dank glory a drinker desires, but they’re also heavier hitters, not suited for anytime consumption.', 'Hash Session is an engaging new entry in an overcrowded field.', 'As if reading my thoughts, man, SweetWater just released Hash Session, its springtime entry into the mega-crowded session IPA market. To recap: A session IPA delivers a tornado of flavors and aromas, all the orange, pine, and peaches present in a higher-strength package, just at lower concentrations of alcohol. Drain a couple, and you can still recite ABCs back to front.', '""We’ve wanted to brew a session IPA for a long time, and access to hop hash finally allowed us to deliver one in true SweetWater style,"" head brewer Nick Nock said in a release. He built the beer, a bantamweight 4.2 percent, with a bit of wheat and Maris Otter malt, lending a lingering white head and a smooth, substantial mouthfeel, more than expected for a light alcohol load. The session IPA’s a bit chewy, gritty even, a not unpleasant emblem of hop hash. The resin, from Amarillo hops, imparts all the penetrating aromatics for which IPA lovers go ape, a focused charge, floral and orange-y, amplified by dry-hopping with watermelon-like El Dorado and citrusy Ahtanum. The bitterness bums a long ride on your tongue, right through each drying sip. I don’t mind, but I can see how it could be a turnoff.', 'Ripped from its backstory, Hash Session is an engaging new entry in an overcrowded field, even if it’s not quite head and shoulders above its contemporaries. It’s the use of hop hash, turning waste into want, that give Hash Session an edge. It’s novel and delivers on its unique narrative, successful lip service, a rare trick in today’s gimmick-mucked market.']"

In the area known as Thai Town, the restaurants were quite different from the ones here in NY. Sure, New York has Isan places serving the fiery salads of northeastern Thailand, and khao soi cafes from the Chinese-leaning city of Chiang Mai. We have restaurants slinging the curries and basil stir fries of central Thailand, some focusing on Bangkok. And we have places like Pok Pok and Kiin Thai that take a scholarly pan-regional approach. But those Hollywood stars concentrated almost exclusively on noodle soups. My mind was blown.\n  ', 'It’s been possible to find a few dishes on most Thai menus in town typical of those served at places like Hollywood’s Sanamluang, but nothing like its collection of 20 or so noodle entrees. Until 2014, that is, when Pye Boat Noodle appeared in Astoria. The lively place is tricked out like a tropical Quonset hut — all waffled metal, louvered typhoon shutters, and worm-eaten wood. The uniformed waiters are sassy, the service fast, and the food inexpensive.', 'Like the heroine of Brian De Palma’s Carrie, you may encounter pig blood. It’s an important component of boat noodles with pork ($9.95), also known as nam tok. The ""boat"" part refers to sampans that ply the waters of Bangkok’s canals, where the dish was invented in 1942. Like floating McDonaldses, they ladle out fast food, in this case rice noodles in a slightly sweet broth darkly flavored with soy sauce and blood, jumbled with sliced pork, pork meatballs, and crunchy pork rind. Blood makes the soup richer. In Bangkok you’d also get some offal, but who’s complaining?', 'Above: Drunken noodles with beef and papaya salad. Below: Boat noodles with pork. [Photos and lede image:\xa0Tanya Maithai]', 'The menu fills out with other street-style noodles, both brothed and sauced. For lovers of the color pink, there’s yen ta fo noodle ($10.95), seething with shrimp, shrimp balls, fish balls, squid rings, and frilly white fungus in a  too-sweet chicken broth thickened with bean paste — which is where the color comes from. If you prefer dry noodles without soup, then bamee phoo moo dang hang may be your thing. Egg noodles something like curly packaged ramen are tossed with thick slices of pork belly and shreds of crabmeat. Handfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro provide verdency in this dish often peddled in Thailand from carts late at night.', 'A similar noodle joint with the hippie-sounding name of Plant Love House opened on Elmhurst’s Whitney Avenue near the end of 2014. Competing with a half-dozen other Thai cafes in the immediate vicinity with more predictable menus, it never quite developed the following it needed to succeed. So it boldly picked up and moved to Brooklyn, to the Prospect Heights restaurant frontier of Washington Avenue. Cryptically changing its name to Look By Plant Love House, it mounted a similar noodle-focused menu in a deep space with two cramped dining rooms (sit in the front barroom instead), a premises that had failed as several previous establishments, including a clam bar and an Italian restaurant with Israeli flourishes.', 'Nevertheless, the food now is spectacular, perhaps a notch above Pye Boat’s. Boat noodles (guay taio num tok, $11) remain the flagship, here with more piquancy and with blood that seems better integrated into the broth. (There are no tiny clots around the rim, as at Pye Boat). If you’ve previously experienced tom yum as a small bowl of forgettable soup served as an appetizer, you’ll sit up and take notice of Plant Love’s rendition. In a broth propelled by lime juice and fish sauce swim all sorts of proteinaceous ingredients, plus a bonus fried wonton and lots of crushed peanuts. You won’t know where to start. Ask for it ""Thai spicy"" and it will leave you gasping between spoonfuls.', 'Above: Som tum tard and pork blood noodle soup. Below: Khao soy and exterior. [Photos:\xa0Paul Crispin Quitoriano]', 'The menu strays from the true noodle path more often than Pye Boat does, and there are a couple of things so good they shouldn’t be missed. One is khao pad tom yum goong ($12), a umami-exploding fried rice cooked with shrimp paste. It comes cheerfully bannered with cucumbers and cilantro. Spring for the fried egg option (an extra $2), and add runny yolk to the dish’s mellow assets.']"
179,"[""One star for Greenwich Village's new, no-frills meatery"", 'Once upon a time, in a pre-hoverboard world, Americans fell in love with a personal transport device known as the Hummer, a military-inspired, six-thousand-pound behemoth designed to beat up all the other cars in the Nordstrom parking lot. Then gas prices surged, and societal awareness of climate change skyrocketed. All of a sudden, the truck’s 12 miles per gallon seemed like not such great choice for driving your daughter to move-in at Oberlin. So people stopped buying them, and eventually General Motors stopped making them, instead focusing their attention on what buyers seemed to want: lighter, cheaper, more fuel-efficient cars. And the few Hummers that remained on the streets were revered (sort of) or reviled (hello) as classics (or relics). ', 'I recount this tale because if you were to apply to the New York City steakhouse the same consumer logic that precipitated both the rise and the fall of the Hummer, you should theoretically end up with the same result. Theoretically. Lower beef prices in the gilded aughts fueled an Ozerskian breed of conspicuous carnivore, and restaurateurs indulged that desire with plush steakhouses at every turn.', ""But beef prices now, like those of gasoline in 2007, are at an all-time high. And while we may rightly still tip our hats to old-time steak-slingers like Peter Luger and Keens, the truth is that we don't need any more steakhouses in New York. At least, we don't need them in the sense that they currently exist: uniform institutions hawking pricey shellfish platters, á la carte sides, over-chilled Caesar salads, and gargantuan cuts of meat."", 'Quality Eats inside (top) and outside', 'But steakhouses are not Hummers. And instead of closing, or adapting in any real way to our modern, vegetable-centric culinary scene, they somehow keep on opening, increasing their prices and, occasionally, their portion sizes. And why not? The leather booths are still packed. For now.', 'This is what makes Quality Eats, a cramped 70-seat space in Greenwich Village, such a vital (if flawed) addition to New York\'s steakhouse taxonomy. As local meateries push the same strips, ribeyes, and porterhouses —\x80\x94 in sizes where ""for two"" really means ""for four,"" and where a single cote de boeuf can cost as much as, elsewhere, a seven-course tasting menu for two —\x80\x94 Quality Eats stakes its claim on eight-ounce cuts that all clock in under thirty bucks.', ""Consider the restaurant's bavette, or flap steak. It boasts the beefiness of a hanger and packs just a hint more heft than a filet mignon. You may have encountered it at an affordable French bistro, but it's almost never spotted in a steakhouse setting. The importance of this can't be understated: Quality Eats is forcing the modern meat eater outside of her high-flying comfort zone, depriving her of New York strips and Tomahawk chops. And it's making that bump back to cattle class more attractive with a discount, the $19 you'd spend on that bavette would, at Minetta Tavern, barely buy you a beet salad."", ""Quality Eats is run by Michael Stillman, son of Alan Stillman, the man who opened the first TGI Friday's in 1965 and was the force behind the Smith & Wollensky chain. Stillman fils inherited the family propensity for steakhouses, giving the world Quality Italian (a chophouse that reads like a more corporate Carbone) and Quality Meats, the Midtown restaurant that sells 64-ounce cuts and ice cream by the pint, and which loaned its name (while withholding a key consonant — the M is scratched out in the logo, and conspicuously absent above the restaurant's door) to Stillman's latest endeavor."", ""Quality Eats' hanger steak (left) and crab and avocado starter"", ""It's understandable that Stillman's other restaurants, like so many New York steakhouses, exist in the realm of the jaw-droppingly expensive.

But all costs are rising, and they're rising for everyone —\x80\x94 labor, benefits, real estate, ingredients —\x80\x94 and the restaurant industry is adapting. As expense-account tasting-menu spots like Brooklyn Fare and Le Bernardin push their prices further into the stratosphere, a crop of restaurants\x80\x94 like Contra, Semilla, and Estela have sprouted up, all hawking more affordable takes on small plates and set menus."", ""It's smart business. These new-model restaurants are catering to a larger audience. They're not just responding to the most recent downturn; they're preparing for the next one. But, until Quality Eats, there isn't really anyone in New York reimagining the steakhouse in the same way. It's surprising that the genre has shown such intransigence in adapting to the financial straits of aspiring gourmands, in giving anything more than a curtsy toward our (nominally) healthier culinary zeitgeist, or in addressing the disparity between waiter pay and cook pay.

The concept certainly seems to be finding its audience: Try to snag a week-ahead reservation for Quality Eats and you'll get, at best, a 10 p.m. booking.

Lately, changes have been legion at Starr Hill. The brewery freshened its labels and installed new brewmaster Robbie O’Cain, who’s pounding an experimental path paved with flavor.

A pinch of powdered ginger my enliven a roast chicken; cinnamon is used as if it were, quite literally, worth its weight in gold. French and Arab cooking techniques are woven throughout, like colorful threads in a Berber wedding kaftan.', 'Which is why news that Bar Omar was opening in Williamsburg three months ago was so exciting. Not only is it the city\'s only Algerian restaurant that I know of, but it\'s also linked to Chez Omar, a 38-year-old French-Algerian cafe in Paris\'s 3rd arrondissement, which one American tourist referred to as ""culinary heaven."" Near the corner of Grand and Bedford, with front windows flung open to late spring breezes, the deep and snaking interior effectively summons a classic French bistro.', ""A wooden bar clad in brass is flanked with bentwood stools darkly stained, and used bricks dabbed here and there with paint pave the walls. Antique-looking mirrors hang throughout, giving Brooklyn boulevardiers discreet views of other tables. There is an interior room in which a stunning quietness prevails, where you may converse to your heart's content as you sip modestly priced wines. The Provençal rosé from Jas des Vignes ($31), fruity and dry, goes well with the tajines and couscouses that form the heart of the Maghreb menu; for the French flourishes like steak frites and assorted salades, pick the austere and lightly tannic Côtes du Rhône from Les Argentières ($31)."", 'Bar Omar.', 'The menu is perhaps too brief, featuring both Algerian and French classics but containing more than one North African dish worth savoring. Brick au thon ($10) makes a very nice appetizer for two. Sheets of warka pastry, similar to phyllo, come wrapped around tuna. Also cracked in the package is a raw egg. As the dish is cooked briefly on each side, the white coagulates while the yolk remains runny. Cut into the thing and yellow should spurt out, as it did on one occasion at Bar Omar, though not on another due to overcooking. No matter, it was tasty both times, like a Moorish tuna sandwich.', 'The more familiar bastilla, another pastry made from warka, comes layered with chicken and topped with cinnamon and powdered sugar, making for a starter that also shouts, ""dessert!"" In Algeria, the meat would be pigeon (squab), a far darker and richer bird. No North African restaurant in town has had the chutzpah to serve the pastry with its authentic filling, maybe because New Yorkers actively hate pigeons. Aside from three rather mundane salads (including one featuring endive, walnuts, apples, and balsamic vinaigrette), we\'re pretty much at the end of your appetizer choices.', ""Which is fine because the tajines are so damn good. These seem to be finished in the conical clay contraption from which the dish takes its name, which is nothing short of wonderful. Most North African restaurants in town simply dump the finished stew in the tajine as if it were merely a serving vessel. Does the charred clay add to the flavor? Not sure, but it certainly adds to the pleasure of eating. My favorite tajine ($36, for two) features eggs and kefta in what amounts to a Creole sauce, chunky with tomatoes and green peppers.

The nine variations ($18 to $28) simply involve serving meat on the side, the same selection that populates the Meat and Fish section of the menu.

Nor is Tibet located along spice routes, so flavorings are limited to the scallions and cilantro that give the cuisine its vibrancy.', 'But enough of Tibet’s gastronomic limitations. There is plenty of excitement in mung bean starch alone — a clear jelly that comes molded into noodles and cakes. Against this slipperiness chopsticks are all but useless. In the French-sounding laphing ($4), railroad ties of the pale and translucent starch are heaped up and an oily red sauce dribbled over the top. The first nibble is cool on the tongue, but then chile flakes light up your mouth. Next the Sichuan peppercorns kick in, like chewing on an electric wire. These peppercorns are a recent addition to the Tibetan spice shelf, the result of migration over the mountain passes to China in the north.', 'In spicy phing ($5) the starch is cut into transparent and colorless fettucine, then dumped into a broth zapped with garlic and black vinegar, with chopped green onions and cilantro on top. Phing in soup ($6) is the unspicy counterpart. Both can be had in vegetarian and beef-bearing versions, with beef being the universal substitute for yak at every Tibetan restaurant in the U.S.; somehow, the American yak-farming industry never got off the ground. The empty spaces around LaGuardia might be the perfect place for a yak ranch.', 'Laphing mung bean jelly; Below: Tingmo bread and homemade yogurt', 'Unfortunately, the beef used at Cholsum is as tough as a rime-encrusted winter boot, so tender-beef fanciers would do well to avoid those dishes that incorporate big pieces of it, such as beef salad, beef chili, and the so-called ""special rice plate.""

Put one in your pocket for the subway ride home.', 'Beef also appears to semi-spectacular effect in beef with potato ($9), the only occurrence of spuds on the menu. In a rich chile sauce with a few tiny chunks of meat, this stew is as close as Tibetan food comes to Indian.

Robbins tips her hat to the Italian-American tradition of old with what the menu calls ""burratino toast,"" and which turns out to be an exceptional take on garlic bread.

Perhaps you never went in the first place, because you thought a $1,000 dinner date was elitist and foolish. But many of you indulged. Per Se, after all, wasn't a Lamborghini, an out-of-reach-acquisiton that makes the buyer look like a jerk; Per Se was a night out to see Hamilton: a cultural phenomenon that middle-class food-o-philes saved up for. It was a place to understand old French indulgences (foie gras, truffles) and to seek fluency in new American luxuries (sous-vide short ribs, cryovac melons). Then the prices went up and the food went downhill. The New York Times published a devastating pan, and this critic said the tired cuisine was about what one would expect out of a high-end shopping mall. It all raises the question: Where does one now splurge for a crash course in modern fine dining? Simple: You visit the only major Kings County restaurant with a no-jeans policy. You visit Brooklyn Fare."", ""A man in a suit presents an overfilled trout roe tartlet. The shades of orange, brown, and white evoke the sleepy salmon cornets that inaugurate every tasting at Per Se. Then you take a bite. The fish eggs roll around in the mouth like piscine marbles, each edible sphere as firm and distinct as a grain of sushi rice. A layer of trout mousse underneath coats your palate, tempering all the unctuous excess. This is when you realize that chef Cesar Ramirez is subtly telling you that he can do better than Keller. And that you shouldn't settle for a tiny cornet when you can have what this glistening, golden creation really looks like: a proper crown."", 'Kaluga caviar atop a dashi sabayon and trout roe tartlets ', ""That same man in a suit, who stands behind the U-shaped table, bestows another gift: a giant dollop of golden osetra roe atop a warm dashi sabayon, a high-end caviar that typically runs $60 extra at Per Se. At Brooklyn Fare, there's no extra charge; every diner is privy to these buttery, barely briny beads. With a flick of the tongue, they evaporate like a summertime tidal pool."", ""New York's tasting menu venues, predominantly fancy, French-y, Midtown institutions in the early aughts, gave way to stripped-down American counter spots in downtown Manhattan and Brooklyn in the decade that followed, with longer menus and smaller portions catering to our shorter social media attention spans. As rooms shrank, the number of courses seemed to grow, giving risk-taking chefs more room to experiment. This reality, alas, also produced syllable-sized dishes served at such a rapid pace they sometimes felt like real-time slideshows of food, edible press releases designed to be instantly preserved in the electronic amber of Instagram. Eat, snap, forget."", 'Brooklyn Fare, which opened in 2009 next to its namesake market, exemplified many of these trends, both good and bad. Patrons sat on hard metal chairs around a U-shape counter. Ramirez, late of Bouley, pitched up to thirty courses of French-Japanese fare at a breakneck pace. The tone was dinner-party strict. Ramirez would wait until everyone quieted to announce each course. Guests who were twenty minutes late would find themselves seven courses behind. (I once double fisted a few bites to catch up.) No pictures or note-taking were allowed; when I asked about this a few years back, Ramirez just smiled and quipped, ""I just want everyone to leave their guns at the door."" The lack of a liquor license meant diners brought their own wines, chilled their own wines (you had to make cute little snow mountains with crushed ice to chill the bottlenecks), and poured their own wines. And this was all okay, because dinner for two wouldn\'t run more than $500.', 'Inside Brooklyn Fare', ""Then Brooklyn Fare started serving wine. And as the economy rebounded, the cost of dinner inched up further. What was once one of the city's best bargains turned into one of our most expensive establishments. Dinner is now $306 per person, service included, which means a fully-loaded dinner for two, with beverage pairings, can scratch at $1,000. And that's okay, because while Per Se, at $325, has done little to merit its increasingly higher prices over the years, Brooklyn Fare has transformed itself from a lean, underdog chef's counter into one of the city's most comfortable and compelling expressions of haute cuisine."", ""Black leather stools now allow for more comfortable feasting. Zalto stems stand tall in front of every guest. Sommeliers glide to and fro, picking out steely whites to pair with slices of gently charred mackerel. The slower pace and shorter course count (around fifteen plates or so), affords each dish more time for conversation and contemplation. That's hugely important if you believe that Ramirez's cuisine deserves a place in our ongoing culinary conversations, a tough standard to meet for a chef with no cookbook to reinforce our memories of his delicacies, few media appearances to tout his likeness, and a strict photo policy that keep his innovations somewhat under the radar."", 'Wagyu, a majestic bovine breed whose flesh is as marbled as bluefin tuna belly, has developed somewhat of a reputation in New York, where it often precedes the word ""meatball"" or ""slider."" At Brooklyn Fare, Ramirez sets us all straight, serving an insanely expensive A5 Miyazaki over grated daikon and horseradish. The cut is so gorgeously fatty you could practically spread it over toast like marrow. The robust roots underneath, in turn, slice through the Wagyu\'s richness like the tart-spicy condiments on a roast beef sandwich.', 'Above: Hokkaido uni toast with black truffle and a chef slicing Miyazaki Wagyu; Below: Chefs prepare frozen soufflees for dessert and lobster poached in shiso butter with apple', ""Classic indulgences like caviar, truffles, and foie gras have slowly disappeared from tasting menus as our notions of luxury evolve to include more sustainable excesses like house-aged game, repurposed food waste, oily fish, and custom vegetables from bespoke farms. Of the city's long tasting menu venues, only Per Se and Brooklyn Fare consistently act as an immersion class into these high-end commodities of yesteryear. So it's a shame that you when show up for those marquee ingredients at Per Se they can cost up to $300 extra per person."", 'At Brooklyn Fare there are no two-tiered culinary experiences, no supplemental charges. Ramirez tops sweet hokkaido uni with the earthy funk of black truffle in August, or the more ethereal musk of white truffle in December. Each dish is just a bite, yet the flavors linger for minutes. Foie gras is included in the tasting as well, its livery oomph giving weight to a mind bending black truffle and king crab chawanmushi. And then white truffles appear again in a scoop of ice cream infused with the heady tuber, a single scoop that costs an extra $68 at Masa in Manhattan.', 'Chef Cesar Ramirez', 'But while Ramirez lures us in with such goodies, he quietly wows with more subdued surprises: a soft bite of abalone in a sauce of its own liver. He slow cooks a slice of deep sea snapper but leaves the scales intact, letting the marshmallow texture of the flesh contrast with the rough exterior, crisped up like maritime baklava. The chef, always dressed in a white button-down and black-framed glasses, cherishes unexpected crunches. He strolls over as I notice how the skin on a duck breast is a bit more cooked than usual.

Ramirez has, it should be noted, been accused of various things over the years, ranging from racism to making a guest cry (allegations which he's denied). I've visited Brooklyn Fare seven times since it opened (twice these past five months) and I've only encountered a chef so hospitable I once named him my favorite waiter."", ""Give Ramirez credit: he's turned his Tasting Temple by Cesar into something larger, a proper restaurant that's less about the chef and more about the guest, and a venue that still feels as relevant as ever as its strengths switch from the cutting edge (which it still embodies) to the classic (which it's becoming).

The bar and cafe occupied some rather louche real estate, a rickety, walk-up storefront on Houston just west of Bowery. Uruguayan-born chef Ignacio Mattos —\x80\x94 who'd been unceremoniously canned from his previous gig at Isa, one year earlier —\x80\x94 was now visible through Estela's kitchen door, enthusiastically making small, quirky dishes so intense one or two were enough. In fact, friends and I developed the habit of sneaking into the place around six in the evening, just before it got slammed. We'd sit at the bar and knock back a glass of wine and a vinegary mussels escabeche on toast, or a bright red beef tartare crunchy with sunchokes."", ""So, if you're Mattos and partner Thomas Carter, what do you do for an encore three years down the road? The answer is, you let the pendulum swing in a more conservative direction, highlighting bankable rather than groundbreaking. Hence, Cafe Altro Paradiso, which partly functions as a surprisingly conventional Italian restaurant. Seating around 90, the U-shaped, high-ceilinged room sits behind a sliver of park at Spring and 6th Avenue, a non-neighborhood whose main commercial denizens are an outsize Trump hotel condominium and the modernistic new God's Love We Deliver."", ""The room is handsome enough — chestnut-colored wood wainscoting with a creamy shade of white on the walls above, hung with gigantic tilted mirrors that reflect the room to infinity. Black-and-white photos by Leon Levinstein, mainly showing people's backsides, cluster on a wall near the bar, making the place feel lively and coldhearted simultaneously. The room sports industrial light fixtures overhead that, when you've had a few glasses of wine and your head lolls back, make the place seem like a bus depot. As befits a depot, the noise level is deafening."", ""My first meal was not inspiring. A few days after opening, the place was already mobbed, and a companion and I were seated at a bottleneck near the greeter's podium. It was like being in a small boat in rough seas, as we were jostled from every angle. What's more, a pair of short plates proved disappointing, more so since they seemed like Estela rejects: a puny octopus tentacle waving in a stubble of chickpeas and a beef carpaccio laid like a wrinkled hanky across a few slivers of potato chip. Modest in size, both dishes were priced at $18."", ""But on subsequent visits, the better selections fell into place like a well-dealt hand of cards. And, with aid from chef de cuisine Aidan O'Neal, Mattos' genius was once again on display. The best starters cover the plate like an abstract canvas. A fluke crudo ($16) intersperses limpid swatches of raw fish and caper berries, irrigated with pungent olive oil; burrata flattened like a schnitzel plays tag with cured lemon rind and market greens; and a simple pork sausage poises like a blimp fallen from the skies next to a hedge of cooked greens. Never has a homemade link tasted porkier!"", 'Crudo and coppa with anchovy crostini.', 'Other apps are more facile, representing the servings of cold cuts and cheeses that make up much Italian antipasti. This is where restaurateurs rub their hands in glee —\x80\x94 aside from time spent by the slicer and the cost of ingredients, turning out these small plates is pure profit. Nevertheless, the coppa (a neck-meat salumi, $13) is so flavorful and nicely marbled, it shouldn\'t be missed. ""Is this made in-house?"" I asked the waiter one evening, expecting a ""yes"" as I dabbed the grease from my lips. ""No, it comes from Salumeria Biellese in Chelsea,"" was his forthright reply.', ""The menu is divided into three categories: starters, pastas, and mains, so a classic Italian three-course progression seems on the agenda. But the apps outnumber the combined total of noodles and entrees, so you wouldn't be out of line treating Paradiso as a short-dish wine bar, either, in the same vein as Estela. Four or five in number on a series of menus, the pastas ($19 to $27) are small for the price, making sharing difficult. Simply stuffed with scintillating ricotta, the half-moon ravioli are invariably a good choice. One evening they were sauced with verdant nettles, and on another occasion, stuffed instead with prosciutto, they shone in a broth with fresh favas. Garganelli, shaped like the trachea of a small animal, are deliciously tossed with dark-meat chicken and green olives ($22), while, best of all, firmly cooked spaghetti finds its perfect seasonal counterpart in a ramp pesto ($19)."", 'Spaghetti with ramps and ravioli.', ""Third courses are often tasty, but also present little selection. Best was a plate of calf's liver ($26), seared and served Venetian-style with caramelized onions and a tiny schmear of polenta. Worst was a chicken Milanese ($28) breaded with panko that was technically perfect, but practically flavorless. At one time, the menu boasted a roster of main course specials, one for every night of the week, including classics like bollito misto and beefsteak Florentine. No more! — Thus tilting the menu further in a tapas direction. No matter, grazing is the new eating, and Cafe Altro Paradiso is well advised to let you pass the football long or short where dinner is concerned."", ""One further note: Thomas Carter and wine director Megan Mina's wine list is brilliant, mainly Italian, with plenty of unusual red and white varietals, bold red blends, big-name Barolos and Brunellos, and some damn fine bargains in the $35 to $50 range.

We read reviews for vicarious experience: What is it like to snag a seat at a pizzeria that only doles out tickets via email once a month? We read reviews for context on the larger culinary world: Is fine dining broadening its appeal by taking inspiration from street snacks, or simply putting itself further out of touch by charging top dollar for things that used to be cheap?', ""So, a restaurant review isn't just a restaurant review.

David Chang's restaurants get plenty of attention from the press, and there's a reason for that: the 38-year-old is one of the most influential chefs of his generation. He's responsible for transforming the humble Taiwanese steamed bun into an object of universal hipster desire at Noodle Bar, and he's trying to do the same with the spicy fried chicken sandwich at Fuku. He helped popularize, at Ssam Bar, the now-ubiquitous phenomenon of serving upscale share plates in stripped-down environments for a few dollars less than elsewhere."", ""With Nishi, a pasta and raw fish hangout on Eighth Avenue, the Momofuku trajectory gets even more interesting. It's the company's first new, full-service New York restaurant in five years, and it's espousing a style of multi-cultural mashup that's new to the restaurant group. Italian-inspired dishes fortified with Asian ingredients is a model New York has seen before, at venues like All'Onda and Basta Pasta, but Chang is pushing the envelope a bit harder here. His kitchen replaces the anchovy in bagna cauda with fish sauce, for example, and the butter with walnut puree, and the result is pretty rad, the loose, funky crumble of the nuts evoking the coarse texture and umami of parmesan."", ""Nishi is also the first Momofuku restaurant to adopt a no-tipping policy, which means prices are a bit higher to reflect the overhead cost of paying both cooks and servers a higher, more fair wage. If gratuity-free dining works here, it's likely Chang will adopt the policy throughout his empire, which in turn could spill over to other restaurant groups. In short, there is a heck of a lot riding on this place."", ""I visited Nishi five times. My first experience was an impromptu late-night meal after working up an appetite at my gym, a few blocks away. Even at 10:30pm, the place was packed, with a few familiar faces in the house. (Hey there, Kate Krader!) Like any professional follower of restaurants, I'd seen the slideshows of Nishi's interior — there's a whimsical painting of a woman in a bathing suit riding what appears to be a post-nuclear apocalypse monster bicycle — but still, I was surprised by how spare the room felt in person, boasting none of the modest comforts that Chang has been leaning towards lately, at Ko and elsewhere."", ""Blond wood bar stools, like the much-maligned ones at Noodle Bar, have flat seats with no backs or cushioning, and many of them, rather than overlooking the restaurant, give their occupants a direct view of a wall. The bright glare of the kitchen spills out into the dining room, contrasting with the dim light of the front-of-house. This is a barely tolerable scenario even by fast food standards (even McDonald's has seats with backs), and yet Nishi is among the most culinarily ambitious and sophisticated in Chang's empire."", 'Joshua Pinsky, formerly of Ko, is the chef de cuisine. He riffs on cacio e pepe — a Roman dish that combines pasta, pecorino, and pepper — with something he calls ceci e pepe (""chickpeas and pepper""), taking out the traditional cheese and subbing in a proprietary chickpea miso substitute that Chang has dubbed ""hozon."" Texturally, it\'s exactly like the traditional dish, packing a silky, creamy mouthfeel. But the hozon replaces the gorgeously stinky overtones of pecorino with a marked sweetness, one that the warming pepper more or less manages to keep in check. (A little finishing salt, provided upon request, helps even more). It\'s a dessert pretending to be a savory pasta, and it\'s absolutely majestic.', ""It's the type of mind-bending creation that reminds me of some of my international encounters with Italian food, from llama-meat stuffed lasagna in the Bolivian salt flats to pizzas topped with mayonnaise (instead of mozzarella) on the outskirts of Moscow. What makes Nishi so exciting is that Pinsky is forcing New Yorkers to look beyond the framework of regional Roman or Sicilian traditions (or American red sauce affairs), and to meditate upon the fact that Italian food can be just as compelling when it's completely (and sometimes unrecognizably) interpreted through the eyes of another culture or chef. Nishi's food rebels against the shackles of authenticity."", ""But then the check came, and my nascently forming plans to write about the restaurant in the context of the globalized Italian pantry, or maybe Momofuku's evolution as a restaurant group, went flying out the window."", ""I was dining solo, and my meal of three dishes and three drinks ended up costing me $124. Sure, that's perhaps one more cocktail than the average dinner order, and yes, a zero-gratuity check is always going to be higher than one without.

""Actually, we have a few parties coming in,"" she said. ""So we\'ll text you when your seat is ready."" I was sent back outside, into the 17-degree weather.

That's why critics visit more than once, and why we usually wait a while for a restaurant to find its groove.

Among other things, I want to make sure I'm reviewing a venue that's not going to completely change its menu in the weeks that follow my writeup, obviating its usefulness to my readers.

The email went on to mention the restaurant\'s noise levels, the still-in-development bread service, the difficulties of keeping labor costs in check in a no tipping environment, and the slow pace of menu progression. Altogether, it was perhaps one of the most lucid criticisms I\'ve read of any a restaurant, and it was coming from the restaurant itself. It was strikingly, almost confusingly honest.', 'Chang himself backed up the email, telling me over the phone that acoustics ""have to get better""; that the kitchen, due to overtime constraints, is still in ""training mode""; that the dining room is admittedly lacking in traditional comforts; that the restaurant is contemplating adding tea service (even though there\'s not enough room in the front of the house); that the team is working on bread service (which is difficult because there\'s insufficient room to warm loaves in the back of the house); and that the entire kitchen needs an overhaul.', ""I've never before presented restaurants with the opportunity to argue against my review pre-publication.

The question it raises, however, is whether other diners know that Chang knows that Nishi isn\'t up to par, whether they know they\'re paying full price for something a prominent, experienced restaurateur will preemptively acknowledge isn\'t good enough. And there\'s also the question of why Chang, a seasoned businessman, would keep running an establishment that his team admits is the wrong space for that concept, rather than temporarily closing and re-building the restaurant that his talented staff and loyal guests deserve. Chang told me during a phone call he\'ll be able to do a big renovation down the road ""if the restaurant is successful.""', 'He should do that renovation now.', ""Nishi isn't a mom-and-pop joint operating on a shoestring in an inherited space.

But despite the brilliant work of the kitchen and the front-of-house team, Nishi is hobbled by its physical space, its prices, and its incomplete presentation of high-end dining.

190,"['More peppery Chinese food emerges in the East Village', 'The city is undergoing a spiciness explosion. Tick off all the ways you can burn your mouth these days: Mexican, Thai, Indian, Korean, Ethiopian, and, of course, Chinese — of which its most incendiary evocation is Sichuan, right? There’s one type of Chinese cooking that\'s often hotter. Just to the southeast of Sichuan in the province of Hunan is a cuisine considered fierier, though it generally omits the electric excitement of ma la peppercorns. Instead, Hunan deploys a devastating combination of dried red chiles, fresh green chiles, black and white peppercorns, and — somewhat unique to its arsenal — pickled chiles, often used in soupy recipes like ""steamed fish head with chopped chiles.""', 'Ferried to the table in a broad, bone-white bowl, the appearance couldn’t be more striking. Rising in the middle like Moby Dick, pectoral fin pointed skyward in the semblance of a wave, a humongous fish head quavers. A good quantity of saffron-colored fluid sloshes around its perimeter, in which bits of pickled chile dance. Atop the head is a heap of chopped scallions, and the color combo of bright red chiles and dark green onions against the gray fish makes it feel like Christmas in March.', 'The beauty of this dish — found at newcomer Hunan Bistro in the East Village — is that it faithfully reproduces a homely provincial classic, fit for an extended family. The copious sauce constitutes the heart of the meal, containing all the steeped goodness of the skin and bones, making what the French would call a fumet. This magnificent broth can serve to moisten gallons of fleecy white rice, as the assembled diners take turns picking bits of flesh off the head, milky eyeballs first. The $26.95 price tag partly reflects the cultural value of this dish, since an entire fish with lots more flesh with an equal quantity of sauce paradoxically costs $2 less.', 'Steamed fish head', 'Open nearly three months on the same block as the mediocre-but-wildy-popular Philly import Han Dynasty, Hunan Bistro languishes half-full on most evenings. The interior is a comfortable mish-mash, with nautical lamps hanging from the ceiling, prim beige banquettes lining the walls, a private room visible through vertical slats, and a few cartoon figures pasted haphazardly on the dark wood paneling, in a half-hearted attempt to jolly the place up. Which should be totally unnecessary given the excellence of its offerings and uniqueness of Hunan food in the East Village.', 'What is Hunan, anyway? Aside from the mixture of chiles, the cuisine boasts lots of preserved meats and vegetables, a broad array of cooking techniques not involving woks, and a strange propensity for mashing seemingly incongruous things. Thus green pepper with preserved egg ($14.95) arrives in a bowl already half-squished, but with a wooden pestle picturesquely sticking out as an invitation to further maceration. In the bowl are fresh green chiles, eggplant, and a couple of 100-year-old eggs, in which the whites have been transformed into translucent obsidian. The taste is fascinating, but one time the mash-up was hot as hell, another it was bland baby food.', 'For an example of virtuoso pickling, look no further than the first appetizer, ""Hunan pickled cabbage"" ($5.95): pale leaves, whole red chiles, and fronds of cilantro, providing prodigious crunch and a subtle sourness. (The same vegetable appears to great effect in the highly recommended beef with pickled cabbage.) Meats and vegetables preserved by salting and drying also play an important role in the cuisine. Both types of preservation are shown in sautéed preserved pork with dried turnips, a stir fry contrasting — in addition to wrinkled turnips — lots of fresh veggies with funky and leathery slivers of pig.', ""Above: Mao's red braised pork belly; Below: Green pepper preserved egg with eggplant and Hunan pickled cabbage"", 'Sichuan and Cantonese dishes also make their way onto Hunan Bistro’s menu, and in general you should skip those. The Sichuan favorite sometimes known as Chongqing chicken — you know, the one with the tidbits of poultry interspersed with a mind-boggling number of dried chiles — is here rendered without toasting the chiles first, creating a restrained rendition of the recipe. Tea smoked duck is another of the Sichuan fails, dry as a pile of kindling. There are some northern Chinese things on the bill of fare, too, such as lamb with cumin and sweet-and-sour chicken — save those for your next trip to Flushing.', 'Instead go for Mao’s red braised pork belly ($14.95). This provincial classic is not a commentary on the Chairman’s anatomy, but rather a dish that comes from his hometown of Shaoshan, Hunan, and said to be his favorite. It arrives in a ceramic crock having benefitted from a cooking technique in which Shaoxing rice wine and soy sauce impart a distinctive color to the thick sauce, flavored with ginger and star anise, creating a sort of glue that binds the pork belly, chestnuts, cloves of garlic, and other ingredients in a thick goo. Back in China the dish is fed to children to increase brain power; at Hunan Bistro, it’s merely the best thing on the menu.', 'Cost: Dinner for four, featuring dumplings, another app, a communal soup, a fish head, Chairman Mao’s pork belly, and a vegetable, including tax but not tip, $100.', 'Sample dishes: Cold bean curd Hunan style, braised rice noodles, green pepper with preserved egg, Mao’s red braised pork belly, steamed fish head with chopped chiles.', 'What to drink: For now, Hunan Bistro is B.Y.O.B., so truck in those large-format Japanese beers!', 'Bonus tip: Soups such as Chinese yam with pork ribs are thin and watery, but they make excellent palate cleansers during a hopelessly rich meal.

191,"[""Two stars for the Charlie Bird crew's vino-soaked take on the modern New York pizzeria"", ""To a certain degree, the glass makes the wine. When you drink out of a clunky flute, you end up sensing the flaws of cumbersome glassware more than the complexities of good Champagne. But take a high-end stem —\x80\x94 a Zalto, for example. At just over half the weight of an iPhone, you barely notice it in your hand. The lip rests against your mouth with all the heaviness of a doily. And the bowl, which looks thinner than gossamer, boasts sufficient magical aromatic properties to make a bottle of Blue Moon drink like one of the world's most fragrant beers. The extravagant cost of each stem (about $60) keeps glasses of this quality confined, for the most part, to the country's priciest establishments. And yet, when you're led to your table at Pasquale Jones, a damn good Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Nolita, there's a Zalto waiting at each place setting."", ""The kitchen sends out your clam pie, and right away you know that this one makes the famous Franny's version feel like amateur hour. The nickel-sized mollusks float in just enough cream to recall the last few sips of bowl of clam chowder, but not so much as to turn the crust soggy. Wisps of broccoli rabe, doing their best impression of seaweed, are strewn about, providing a gently bitter counterpoint to all the salt and fat. You eat this quickly, then reset the palate with a $28 glass of Bereche bubbly that's so tangy and light in your Zalto that it feels as if you're using a pencil sketch of a glass to drink a cumulus cloud."", ""This restaurant, the brainchild of Robert Bohr, Grant Reynolds, and Ryan Hardy, the guys behind Charlie Bird in the West Village, might be the city's poshest pizzeria. You'll find ramp pies, service-included prices that aren't sky-high, vintage Dom Perignon, custom-built Stefano Ferrara wood ovens, $125 rib steaks cooked by a chef who wears an Apple Watch, and a dining room full of strapless, backless, bare-shouldered patrons who look like glossy cut outs from the pages of Vogue. A bespoke floral arrangement flanks the south side of the dining room, and an artful arrangement of rhododendrons liven up a loo that's decked out with Jo Malone candles, Aesop hand soaps, and fruit-flavored Tootsie Rolls."", ""Some critics might deride all this as yet another sign that even the pizzeria — that humblest of New York institutions — is not immune to the allure of making things a little bit fancier, a smidge pricier, a touch more out-of-touch. And perhaps there's an element of truth to that. But there's also a larger element of democracy at play here at Pasquale Jones, and I'm not even talking about the Tootsie Rolls."", 'The dining room at Pasquale Jones (left); the braised pork shank', ""Canonically, ordering beer or wine with pizza at a slice joint will always involve Miller Lite in a plastic cup or California chardonnay in a screwtop mini-bottle. And it was only the not-too-distant past when imbibing at a nouveau-Neapolitan sit-down spot meant cheap Chianti splashed into a stubby tumbler, or a short-stemmed break-proof glass from the restaurant supply store filled to the top to punish any potential swirlers with a stained shirt. But right now in New York, both pizza and wine have grown up, and at pizzerias like Marta and Roberta's, thin-lipped glassware — not to mention funky biodynamic wines or deep selections of grower Champagne — is more common than not."", ""The importance of these wine lists can't be understated: They expose their restaurant's diners to wines they might not otherwise encounter, the sort of thing you might only otherwise expect to find at Michelin-starred French spots or trendy small plates places with pedigreed chefs. But now, you can get them with pizza. If you're taking the financial leap to sample a skin-contract orange wine for the first time — perhaps a Fontanasanta Manzoni Bianco, a luscious cross between a pinot bianco and a riesling —\x80\x94 do you want it paired with an avant-garde creation with foams and flowers? Or do you want it paired with a pork and onion pie at Pasquale Jones?"", 'I\'ll tell you this: You want it with the pork and onion pie. Chef Hardy does just that for you, piling heady jowl and stinky pecorino over a tomatoey crust for a flatbread take on the classic Roman Amatriciana. But here\'s what\'s even better: Pasquale doubles down on that emerging great-wine-for-everyone ethos with a plan to lure in both the snobs and the amateurs by serving their pizza-friendly vino in some of the world\'s best glasses — but also by making it ultra accessible, with any of the non-sparkling ""seasonal"" wines (of which there are 56, none over $75) available by the half-bottle for half the list price. That\'s a rare and generous policy, one that translates into a path to sampling that Manzoni for as little as $35.', ""The obvious benefit is to the diner's wallet, but there's something more important going on here: Pasquale is lowering the barrier to entry to trying an off-the-beaten track wine not just from a financial perspective but from a consumptive perspective. Just as a chef has more opportunities to try and fail with experimental dishes over a long tasting menu, rather than having to play it safe over a four-course meal (where, due to the limited scope, each course has to knock it out of the park), an aggressive half bottle program encourages diners to take more risks while drinking."", ""This all the more important during a pizza meal, which tends to run shorter than other dinners. A party of two, who'll maybe only typically order a single bottle of Nebbiolo over their 90-minute dinner, can at Pasquale Jones now double their variety and take a chance on two 375ml experiments, opening their palates to wines perhaps too rare or edgy for a restaurant to open up and move by the glass."", ""Maybe I'm diving too far deep into the behavioral microeconomics of pizza pairings. But as much as the sports-jacketed sommeliers at tasting menu venues are changing the way fine-diners drink by expanding wine pairings to include sherries, sakes, beers, cocktails, and mocktails, the waiters in denim shirts at Pasquale are changing the way pizza-eaters drink by using the pies to get us in the door, and exposing us to wines we've never heard of."", ""Pasquale Jones's clam pizza"", ""As dining rooms throughout the city cut back on amenities to keep prices reasonable amid rising labor and real estate costs, Pasquale counts itself among the rare non-exorbitant restaurant to keep your back straight and your posterior padded. It's comfortable — not an adjective one usually associates with pizza parlors."", ""Bar stools and banquettes boast lumbar support. Temperature levels remain bearable, even for those seated in front of the wood-burning ovens. Sound levels are never quite as ear piercing as one might expect at such a hip venue (Charlie Bird's decibel levels were brutal in its early pre-soundproofing days). Those scented candles in the bathroom? They're a reprieve from the woodsmoke gently perfuming the dining room. Hosts check your bags without giving you a ticket; they remember who you are. About a third of the dining room is available for booking via Resy, and if that's how you roll, you'd best log on to the app a good two weeks out, when seats are released. The rest of us will wait about 60-90 minutes as walk-ins."", ""The wait is worth it. Ryan Hardy crafts his pies in the New York Neapolitan style, which means no soupy centers or droopy crusts. Nearly every version is perfect, from the brilliant clam and amatriciana pizzas to the margherita pie, whose tomatoes exude aromas that veer from sweet and easygoing to vegetal and tangy. The spicy salami pizza is the requisite pepperoni riff, with the clutch inclusion of Calabrian chiles. They look like chopped up cherry bombs and impart the pie with the type of deeply funky flavor one might expect if a farmer were to water his vegetables with lamb broth. Match that with a half bottle of Vignai Da Duline Schioppettino, with its reserved dark fruit notes, and you've got yourself a nice segue to the mammoth pork shank for two, a mound of achingly rich, fall-apart swine."", ""The precision of Hardy's non-pizza kitchen doesn't quite approach the wonder of his pizzas, technically or creatively, but the fare is enjoyable enough. The pea salad with ricotta is fresh and bright, steelhead crudo shows off the oils of good trout, a dish of braised leeks with walnuts and parmesan packs about as much flavor as a decent delivery salad. Pastas are distinctly average, from the gritty, overcooked, undersalted Roman gnocchi, to porchetta agnolotti, which takes two powerful flavors — black garlic and braised pork — and somehow makes them almost unnoticeable. Chicken is overcooked, and tilefish is a study in how to drown delicate maritime flesh with too much olive oil. It's as if Hardy's approach to non-pizza cuisine is to create a subdued canvas that won't get in the way of the wine, which universally has far more personality."", ""Pasquale Jones doesn't have a pastry chef and it shows; the single sleepy dessert on offer (which changes regularly) evokes the phoned-in confections that David Chang used to serve at Ssam Bar in the pre-Christina Tosi era. On one of my visits, Hardy warmed up strawberries in the oven and topped them with mascarpone gelato; at a later meal, he served the fruit raw with that same frozen treat and a splash of elderflower syrup. It tastes fine — only a human with an iron heart would turn down a sundae — but it would be nice if a restaurant of this ambition served something that I couldn't put together at home in under a minute."", ""But it's a small complaint. Perhaps forgoing a dedicated sweets chef is a reasonable enough tradeoff for a restaurant that strives to stay affordable while offering so many other luxuries. And despite no-tipping setbacks at other casual restaurants, the team behind the restaurant tells me the hospitality-included policy is working out just fine here.

This $16 bowlful of sunshine features perfectly cooked crustaceans heaped on chunky yellow grits, around which a flavorful reddish-brown broth swishes. So far, it’s a pure evocation of a famous Southern dish. But The Heyward embroiders on the regular recipe by substituting chorizo for bacon, then nonchalantly tossing some shishito peppers on top. Though decidedly non-doctrinaire, this version is one of the finest the city has seen since Edna Lewis left. (Shrimp and grits was a cornerstone of her 1976 landmark, The Taste of Country Cooking.)', 'The Heyward is a year-old Williamsburg bistro in the old Zebulon space. The walls are somber dark green and dark gray. The seats are comfortable and adult-sized; some are even padded. ""Is this place aimed at an older crowd?"" A friend inquired as she scanned the laid-back space, where she saw four divided dining zones, one of which provides stools along a semicircular counter looking into a chef’s work area that is more theater than conventional kitchen. The white-clad cooks therein dabble in the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which is a dangerous enterprise. Many previous New York restaurants have foundered on the rocks of American regional cooking.', ""Above: Butternut squash mac 'n' cheese; Below: Hoppin' John and the French toast sandwich"", 'The restaurant is named after turn-of-the-century Charleston literary figure DuBose Heyward, who wrote the novel upon which Gershwin’s ""Porgy and Bess"" was based. (Less auspiciously, he also penned The Country Bunny and the Good Little Shoes.) In tribute to him, and presumably to Charleston itself, which is currently considered one of the hottest food cities in the country, other South Carolina standards are faithfully reproduced, in recipes developed by original chef Derek Orrell, and partly carried on by his replacement, Kevin Bergh.', 'Hoppin’ John ($16) is a dish that traces its lineage back to West Africa, where renditions using black-eyed peas can still be found in Nigeria, Senegal, and Ghana. At The Heyward, heirloom field peas and Carolina gold rice from Anson Mills are used, the way Sean Brock does it at his celebrated Charleston restaurants. Additionally, a piece of seared and browned pork belly is laid across the top, in a salute to Brooklyn’s favorite part of the pig. A contrasting dish substituting sunnyside-up eggs for pork belly appears on the brunch menu. Both are worth ordering, with the beans displaying assertive savor.', 'Reflecting the seafood-centricity of the Lowcountry, there’s a nice French-leaning oyster service (though a little expensive at $3 per) and a bucket of peel-and-eat shrimp, which taste good but leave your fingers smelling funky. Paradoxically, most of the Lowcountry standards are found in the appetizer and side dish sections of the menu. That’s OK, because it’s easy enough to make a meal out of small plates. In addition to the shrimp and grits and hoppin’ John, one might include the sweet-corn-and-pimento succotash (which is not really succotash, because where are the lima beans?), the fried green tomatoes (they recently disappeared from the menu, but will hopefully reappear once summer returns, or the green-tomato truck rolls in from Florida), and the excellent cornbread, which might be mistaken for fine cake.', 'The kitchen at The Heyward', 'Yes, the Lowcountry stuff rocks, especially a delightful she-crab soup now gone from the menu, wherein the savory pink broth had been amplified with rich roe and ramified with fine shreds of fresh crab, with purple micro-greens scattered on top. What a picture it made in the bowl! But venture afterwards to the entrees and find yourself on less agreeable terrain far from the Carolina seaboard. The thick pork chop on a gravel of heirloom carrots is tasty enough, but the hanger steak ($27) hides its few sliced pieces in too much salad for the price, and the roasted cod entrée is just plain dull. Throw away the fish and eagerly suck down the sauce it comes in, a delicious sweet potato vichyssoise. The yams, at least, would be totally at home in South Carolina.', 'Really, if you’re after something in the belt-busting main course category, you can’t do better than The Heyward’s hamburger ($18), which comes capped with very old cheddar and sided with scraggly fries seasoned with Old Bay, fulfilling the divine imperative that every Brooklyn bistro must provide a burger on its menu. Though I don’t usually bother with brunch (broken Hollandaise provokes my gag reflex more certainly than any other substance), I did have a wonderful dish one Sunday morning at The Heyward. Called the French toast sandwich ($15) and recommended by my editor, it wrapped two thick, egg-drenched brioche slices slathered with fig jam around luxuriantly wadded country ham and moist scrambled eggs.

The chef, who prepares my entire meal with no assistance, fans his charcoal behind the counter, wondering if I\'m going to eat.

But in this more exclusive area, curtained off like a first class airline cabin, I\'m the sole guest. The bill of fare is a $140 tasting of chicken parts, surely the most expensive poultry omakase in New York, if not North America altogether. Chef Atsushi Kono has already fed me whole hearts from six pound birds, slices of loin as medium-rare as Minetta steak, and something called main artery, which looks like what would happen if Steven Seagal plunged his hands into the neck of a live rooster and ripped out its carotid, just because. All of these preparations are delicious. But now Atsushi has upped the ante. He places a skewer in front of me. ""Knee bone,"" he says. Am I really supposed to eat the bone? He smiles. ""You eat the bone.""', ""The skewer contains four ostensibly edible knobs. They have not been braised, liquefied, or pulverized, nor have they been boiled into a clear consommé or a milky tonkotsu. They are simply spheres of bone covered by a gumdrop's worthy of charred meat. Soft on the outside and hard on the inside, they are inverted Tootsie Roll lollipops for carnivores. I do not want to eat them."", 'Chicken livers, main artery, hearts, tenderloins, thigh meat, meatballs, and oysters, presented in a box at the beginning of the $140 omakase meal.', ""Knee gristle, as it's also known, is common enough at New York's cheaper yakitori-yas (grilled chicken joints). But it's somewhat unexpected when offered as part of pricier, multi-course meals like this one. Instead of caviar, we're serving kneecap tonight. Despite the city's ongoing craze for paleo broths and crispysardine skeletons, chicken bones haven't really earned a spot on hip Brooklyn menus alongside tripe, feet, and other in vogue off cuts."", 'I start to gnaw on the ossiferous treat. The bone goes SNAP between my molars, shattering like a under-licked gobstopper. Japanese menus sometimes refer to this delicacy as ""soft"" knee bone, but rest assured, it is not soft. ""We like the crunch,"" the chef tells me. So do I. The bone has no flavor. It is pure texture. It is the adult equivalent of a child eating a plastic Happy Meal toy, minus all the digestive repercussions. It is one of the final frontiers in honoring an animal that unwillingly sacrificed itself for our enjoyment. It is, without question, one of the reasons why Tori Shin remains the city\'s best and most ambitious yakitori joint.', ""Remains is the operative word because Tori Shin has been going at it since 2007, when Atsushi (along with owner  Shu Ikeda) set up shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It was a small poultry blip in a pre-crash New York overrun by pork belly, steakhouses, and pan-Asian stadium spots. I started visiting in 2012, not too long after Michelin awarded it a coveted star, and found that Tori Shin was unquestionably serving some of the city's finest (and most expensive) chicken tastings. Problem was, the cramped room felt as inviting as a dragon roll sushi shack. So in June, Atsushi relocated to West 53rd, transforming the ground floor of an apartment building into the more sedate fine dining establishment that Tori Shin always deserved to be, and giving this casual stretch of Hell's Kitchen, peppered with Korean and Japanese pubs, the high-end spot it has long needed."", 'Here\'s the quick tour: A sake bar up front serves sochu-heavy cocktails under golden lights. A small corridor, which runs parallel to the $140 tasting room, leads to the 15-seat chef\'s counter. This is where you do most of your eating. A rectangle of a window overlooks a ""zen garden"" out back; consider it a verdant counterpoint to the gloriously greasy chicken, served in hues of brown, khaki, ochre, and tar. One exception to that color scheme, however, is the tenderloin, grilled to such a creamy white it could seek camouflage in clam chowder. Take a bite. The interior is as rare as barely-cooked tuna.

The furniture in the darkened dining room was junk shop chic, with low metal chairs, slatted wooden benches, tiny two-top tables, plain black pillars, and a rippled ceiling like a Quonset hut, creating an interior something like a makeshift Protestant church in the Bahamas.', 'Welcome to a new category in the evolution of the Chinese restaurant in America, the Chinese restaurant not predominantly run by people whose ancestors lived in China. Partners here are Josh Grinker and Tracy Jane Young, whose previous efforts include Park Slope’s nominally French Stone Park Café. While the food at Kings County has been described as ""classic Central Chinese cuisine"" (whatever that means), the menu is a canny accumulation of regional recipes that have succeeded in America — mainly from Guangdong, Sichuan, Shanghai, and Northern China — only styled for modern bistro tastes. Its immediate inspirations are Mission Chinese and Red Farm, with some fascinating inventions on the part of the restauranteurs.', 'The exterior and interior of Kings County Imperial', 'Unlike similar enterprises in the past that have failed in their attempts to create credible dumplings, the ones here are solid, as good as what you’d find in Chinatown.

""We make our own soy sauce,"" the waitress proclaimed as she set the bamboo basket down. ""You mean in the kitchen?"" My guest replied. ""No, in a factory in China,"" she clarified. ""They make it for us and ship it in barrels, which we tap with a spigot.""', 'Mock eel', 'A special of pork-stuffed Shangahi soup dumplings was great one evening, with a gravy less greasy and salty than usual, though the skins were not quite as thin as the best examples at Flaming Kitchen and Kung Fu Xiao Long Bao. Still, making them from scratch is a technical triumph, though one wonders why the kitchen didn’t create a luxe version based on crab or — what the hell — lobster. The coarse-textured pork shoulder shumai were also tasty, and vegetarians will relish the bok choy potstickers.', 'A large part of the menu is the currently faddish Sichuan, mis-transliterated ""Szechuan,"" as if this were a Chinese menu of the 70s. Found in every Sichuan restaurant in town, cucumbers in hot chile oil ($8) is a pile of sliced Persian cukes with sesame oil, red chile flakes, and fermented bean paste.

The marriage of East and West is subtle and terrific. There are some misfires, too. Sichuan marinated duck ($13) isn’t the tea-smoked whole specimen you might expect, but a wok-seared breast that rests upon a sprout salad laced with smoldering fresh chiles and sided with the scallion-ginger relish that usually accompanies Cantonese charcuterie.

There’s a long bar in front, at which you can eat in an orange glow as the sun sets on the murals, metal recycling depots, artists’ lofts, and small manufacturing facilities in the immediate area.', 'Sweet corn soup', 'Faro opened with a bang in early May with a dish that set jaded tongues wagging (and lapping) — sweet pea porridge ($11). Hey, isn’t porridge reserved for invalids, children, and Scotsmen? As the dish sailed in, the appearance was striking: a mass of white foamy whey seething atop a fine-textured brown gruel, with a ring of glinting olive oil splashed around the edges. Dipping down into the depths one pulled up bright green peas like some unidentified swamp plant. The porridge was mellow, the peas almost unspeakably sweet, and the whole thing mind-bogglingly good.', 'The six starters swapped around as spring sped into summer. Now the peas are sadly gone, to be replaced in the porridge by curls of summer squash and a fried squash blossom, offering one of summer’s best crunches. A cold soup of creamed red peppers soon became an even better soup of pureed sweet corn, with delicate fronds of fennel and a tracery of herb oil on top. The wood-burning oven often sees service where vegetables are concerned. Delicate charred asparagus debuted in late spring well-buttered and tossed with crabmeat; Faro is certainly not a place that fears dairy.', 'One of the best apps, available throughout, has been fire-roasted beets with pistachio pesto resting on a bed of creamed goat cheese ($13). You may have thought yourself tired of beets, but this dish is further amplified with a boiled egg cut in perfect quarters and thin slices of raw-beet carpaccio. I’d pick this any day of the week over the restaurant’s beef tartare, which, despite its zany pickled mustard seeds and shards of crouton, is a bit dull and dry tasting.', 'On to the eight pastas, which are the heart and soul of Faro. While many of them evoke Italian models, they are unique things onto themselves. The squid ink calamarati ($17) sees the chef playing a little joke. The recipe deploys a pasta shaped like squid rings, and actual squid ink generates its glossy midnight hue. But it uses no actual squid. The ink makes the pasta richer, an effect that’s goosed up by a sauce of curried coconut milk. We are already in nutsy pasta territory here, but a half lobster tail and claw flopped on top makes the dish even more surreal — it’s a pasta Salvatore Dali might have invented.', 'Above: Strip loin; Below: Cavatelli and gnocchi', 'Equally unusual is a generous serving of Roman gnocchi — which turns out to be spongy planks more like polenta — tangled like some ancient ruin with swiss chard. Gnudi are more like pasta than naked ricotta dumplings, as they usually are, and come with wonderful soft green chickpeas the likes of which you’ve probably never seen before. Nevertheless, my favorite pasta strove to be more conventional: a miniature cavatelli mixed with pork ragout in pureed ricotta and parsley, which lent a strange greenness to the dish.', 'With pastas so important, the four secondi ($20 each) seem like an afterthought, a sop to patrons who treat protein as the center of attention. Over the last two months, this section has contained duck breast, octopus, scallops, and monkfish, all fired up in the oven. Best is the so-called Murray Gray strip loin, which doesn’t bother to identify the meat — maybe you’re expected to know. Indeed, flip the menu over and read, ""At Faro we are proud to serve meat from Tim Haw’s farm, Autumns Harvest. Their pastured, heritage breed animals go beyond organic and are also certified animal welfare approved.""', 'As it turns out Murray Grey is a cattle breed developed to be drought resistant in New South Wales, Australia, in 1905. The sliced steak at Faro is garnet red, slightly smoky, and tender without being fatty. Really, it’s one of the best steaks in Brooklyn, and it’s nice to consider that you’ll still be able to get it even if New York turns dry like California.

Gear Regulators, the company’s comically oversize answer to Reebok Pumps. It was the early ’90s, and inflatable high-tops were wildly, if mystifyingly popular. Press the tongue’s basketball-shape inflator and the sneaker snugly cinched your ankle, a gimmick masquerading as technological advancement.', 'Naturally, impressionable me needed a pair, hopefully to inflate my social standing in junior high school. The scarcity of Reebok Pumps, and the budget-breaking price tag, led me to L.A. Gear knockoffs, the ones with the teal shoelaces. Instead of following the herds, the Regulators helped me pound my own idiosyncratic path—even if I was occasionally mocked, causing me the kind of blushing shame that, as an adult, I realize is best remedied by an IPA.', '... the beer is a swirl of pineapples, peaches, berries and pine resin, like a fruit smoothie blended in the forest. ', 'The beer style’s bitter charge to the top of the drinking charts has been powered by the new-breed hops of the Pacific Northwest, where the lion’s share of the American crop is cultivated. From orange-like Amarillo to resinous Simcoe and mango-scented Citra, the region’s agricultural bounty is flaunted in every sip. Be it clean and lemony or pungent and pot-like, these modern flavors have struck a live wire with global drinkers. To meet consumer demand brewers are clamoring for ever-larger allotments of hops, but the bitter reality is there’s simply not enough supply.', 'To source a steady stock of aromatically intriguing hops, brewers have begun tapping into Germany’s agricultural pipeline, utilizing brand-new cultivars such as the honeydew-like Huell Melon and tangerine-tinged Mandarina Bavaria. Moreover, brewers are increasingly making use of hops from the Southern Hemisphere, where the growing season is a mirror image. In the Northern Hemisphere, hops are harvested in August and September; beneath the Equator, February typically marks the first plucking.', 'Photo courtesy of Oskar Blues.', 'Lately, New Zealand has been lauded for hops like Nelson Sauvin, a spot-on mimic of Sauvignon Blanc; gloriously grapefruit-focused Riwaka; and lemon-limey Motueka. Australia, increasingly, offers a bounty of vibrantly novel hops, with Galaxy’s profile of peaches and passion fruit proving quite appealing. These Aussie varieties caught the attention of Colorado’s Oskar Blues (the company operates a second brewery in North Carolina), which was finding American hops tough to come by—a pointed challenge, especially when you’re looking to roll out a new IPA.', 'Oskar Blues has always done things differently. The brewery was the first to embrace canned craft beer, cladding its sticky, ""voluminously hopped"" Dale’s Pale Ale in aluminum back in 2002. Since then, the brewery’s product line has become a shrine to hops, including Deviant Dale’s double IPA, imperial-strength and this year’s Pinner, a dank little session IPA. (To be fair, Oskar Blues’ stylistic aptitude also extends to pilsners, Scotch ales and imperial stouts.) But an everyday, regular-strength IPA was nowhere to be found, much like the requisite mountains of American hops.', 'Oskar Blues IPA is an exotic twist on what has become an expected flavor template.', 'Enter Australia. Last year, Oskar Blues took a deep research dive into Down Under hops, discovering flowers with lively, beguiling and altogether original flavors and aromas. Noted standouts included earthy, tropical Vic Secret; grassy, piney Topaz; spicy, anise-scented Ella; and Enigma, a chameleonic Tasmanian variety that might remind folks of raspberry, melon or maybe white wine. Better still, securing the proper poundage proved no problem. Armed with that Australian hop quartet, it was time to brew a new kind of IPA.', 'Packaged in attractive blue cans (those mountains are Colorado’s Longs Peak and Mount Meeker) and released nationwide this month, the plainly named IPA hits you at 6.43 percent ABV, or a splash lighter than the 6.5 percent Dale’s Pale Ale. I’ve always felt that Dale’s (named after founded Dale Katechis) was more aligned with IPAs than pale ales, but hey, I already told you that I wore L.A. Gear Regulators. I am so not the style police.', 'Cascaded into a glass, the IPA is a golden belle with a creamy head that never quite gets the hint to leave. On the aromatic front, the beer is a swirl of pineapples, peaches, berries and pine resin, like a fruit smoothie blended in the forest. The IPA is medium-bodied and lightly sweet, a mix of biscuits and tropical fruit, melons and grapefruit. The low-bore bitterness keeps the IPA crush-worthy, with few speed bumps to prevent repeat consumption.']"
200,"['As rents multiply in the most desirable dining areas — including the East Village, Williamsburg, Crown Heights, NoMad, and the Lower East Side — new restaurants are popping up in unexpected locales. The latest area to attract ambitious restaurateurs is upper Broadway north of 145th Street, west of Sugar Hill, in a neighborhood sandwiched between Hamilton Heights and Washington Heights that as yet has no catchy name. Partly partaking of the Parisian boulevard glamor of the Upper West Side, it still remains a bustling Dominican neighborhood, characterized by dollar discount stores and restaurants deliciously specializing in roast pernil. But gradually, upper Broadway is becoming speckled with coffee bars, gastropubs, and ambitious new restaurants.', ""A prime example is Bono Trattoria (no relation to the Irish rock star). It was started by a pair of Italians, one from Sicily (Graziella LoBrutto), the other from Umbria (Luca Valeriania). Located in a wide and deep corner space, it previously housed a liquor store with Plexiglas barriers and a fine selection of half-pint pocket flasks. Now, the front and side walls have been flung open to late-summer breezes, the ceiling paved with nostalgic stamped tin, and a wood-burning beehive oven installed mid-restaurant. The whitewashed walls are lined with Italian movie stills, and the place seats around 60 at raised tables, conventional two-tops, and at a bar opposite the oven — creating a bottleneck that is the restaurant's chief design flaw."", 'Pie in the oven at Bono', 'The menu offers some of the finest pizzas north of 125th in the currently popular Naples style. The margherita glistens with a plainish tomato sauce and a creamy mozzarella. At $10, the pie is cheaper than similar renditions downtown and in Brooklyn, and every bit as good. (In Greenwich Village, Keste charges $16. Lower rents in disparate locations mean cheaper prices.) Another favorite is fichi ($12), flooded with salty gorgonzola and dotted with pancetta and quartered fresh figs that provide a touch of sweetness and spill their seeds onto the white cheese blanket. Damn, these pizzas are good! Seven more are available.', 'Even better than the pizza is a sideline called focaccia ripiena (""stuffed bread""), which is like a cross between a calzone and a bar-style quesadilla. The best jams sweet pork sausage and spinach between its puffy and yeasty layers. It\'s priced at only $8 for four sizeable wedges served in a basket, making a perfect starter. This stuffed pizza is reminiscent of roadside stands in the Umbrian countryside selling flatbread sandwiches called torta al testo. In fact, many dishes on Bono\'s menu are attributable to the Italian regions the owners came from.', 'Inspired by the same region, strozzapreti alla Norcina ($13) is named after the remote village of Norcia in Umbria\'s far southeastern corner, 42 kilometers over winding mountain roads from Spoleto. The village is known as the hog-butchering capital of Italy, and wonderful salamis, sausages, and cured hams are created there. It is also an area where black summer truffles and porcini mushrooms are found in abundance. All these go together to make Bono\'s strozzapreti — twisted double-hanks of noodle whose name translates to ""priest stranglers,"" illustrating the humor often found in Italian food. The al dente pasta is tossed in a truffle cream sauce with crumbled sweet sausage and porcinis, altogether one of the best dishes I\'ve eaten all summer.', 'Above: Charred octopus and strozzapreti alla Norcina pasta; Below: The fichi pie', 'The other co-owner is undoubtedly responsible for the menu\'s Sicilian flourishes, including the single wood-oven-charred octopus tentacle that constitutes the most commendable app. Other dishes we might associate with the southern reaches of Italy include eggplant parmigiana; a Sicilian pizza with eggplant, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella; and fettuccine alla boscaiola (""hunter\'s fettuccine""), a very rich pasta with onions, asparagus, and pancetta in a sauce thickened with eggs. But whatever region is evoked, Bono tends to get the dishes right.', ""There are a couple of exceptions, of course. Rather than offering a conventional Caprese salad — one of the world's most perfect preparations — Bono gums things up by adding pesto and grilled peaches to the usual ripe tomatoes, mozzarella, and leaf basil. And there's nothing seemingly Italian about the roasted beet salad with herbed goat cheese, which has become so commonplace on bistro menus it only serves to provoke a yawn. The ribeye steak and roast half chicken were substandard, too: the former because it was overdone and not that great a piece of meat to begin with, the latter because it had a reheated mushiness on the day I tried it. Perhaps the menu attempts too much."", 'Still, Bono is overall a very good restaurant, especially if you stick with the apps, pizzas, and pastas. Which is actually good advice where nearly every Italian restaurant is concerned. Almost invariably, higher-priced secondi are for suckers.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including app, pasta, and pizza, with two glasses of wine, $60 with tax but not tip.', 'Sample dishes: Grilled octopus, salumi e formaggi (cured meat and cheese platter), margherita and fichi pizzas, strozzapreti alla Norcina', ""What to drink: Two bottles stand out on the wine list, both for quirky and charming flavor and bargain prices: a Barone Fini Pinot Grigio from the Alto Adige ($32 per bottle), a crisp and unusual expression of the grape, and Dama Marammiero Montepulciano D'Abbruzo ($35 per bottle), nice saturated red to go with your rich pasta."", 'Bonus tip: This is a great place to use simply as a pizzeria, drinking beer and downing slices.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, including app, pasta, and pizza, with two glasses of wine, $60 with tax but not tip.', 'Sample dishes: Grilled octopus, salumi e formaggi (cured meat and cheese platter), margherita and fichi pizzas, strozzapreti alla Norcina', ""What to drink: Two bottles stand out on the wine list, both for quirky and charming flavor and bargain prices: a Barone Fini Pinot Grigio from the Alto Adige ($32 per bottle), a crisp and unusual expression of the grape, and Dama Marammiero Montepulciano D'Abbruzo ($35 per bottle), nice saturated red to go with your rich pasta.""]"

Already one of most scrutinized fine dining destinations in Manhattan and the world, EMP has received even more than its usual amount of press in 2015. Both a four-star New York Times review in March and a nasty takedown in the September issue of Harper’s  mention the pig sac. Chef Daniel Humm, who co-owns the restaurant with front-of-house maestro Will Guidara, had been riffing on poularde en vessie (a French technique in which chicken is steamed in a ballooned bladder) but swapping in vegetables for the poultry: truffled celery root in the winter, asparagus when spring came around. I was at the restaurant in late summer and trying to imagine which seasonal produce might most benefit from a shvitz in a veiny orb. Pattypan squash, maybe?', 'Instead, as the tenth course, a far less dramatic pork presentation arrived: grilled jowl covered with ribbons of watermelon radish and tiny onion flowers. The dish drew its electricity from the sauce, a stock of pork belly and knuckles and chicken wings depth-charged with white soy and ginger juice.', 'I didn’t miss the bladdery theatrics. The $225-per-person meal had already segued through some gentle stagecraft that thankfully never distracted from the actual pleasure of the food. A shallow bowl held what appeared to be a slice of plum tomato. Only it was more of a rumination on tomato: a pure-of-flavor tomato mousse covered with a basil scented tomato puree shaped to resemble a cross-section of the fruit, with tomato seeds, croutons, and pickled shallots scattered on top. Right after it, a tin appeared. The geometric patterns on its lid echoed the dining room’s stately Art Deco decor. It contained poached quail egg, bacon gelee, bits of ham, and corn puree resembling hollandaise; all together, they evoked eggs Benedict. A side of miniature English muffins drove home the theme. A generous spoonful of caviar sent it heavenward.', 'Eggs Benedict in a tin with caviar', 'The Benedict winked at New York’s rabid brunching habits, one of the many cultural allusions Eleven Madison Park has conjured since 2012. That’s the year when the restaurant switched its lengthy tasting menu format to one that included high-concept conceits and nods to the city’s most iconic dishes. Sliced sturgeon emerged from a cloud of smoke released from under a glass cloche. The cheese course was an imagined Central Park picnic, basket included. There were tableside card tricks and history lectures delivered by the servers.', 'Their driving goal: To make every diner blissfully happy, usually through fun, but sometimes through quiet menu and service choices', 'Business did not drop off, but the new direction was met with derision about the shtick and the spiels, and most of the overt dramaturgy is now gone or heavily subdued. The impetus behind the showmanship made sense, though. Humm and Guidara, both still under 40, sought to reinvent high-end dining. Their driving goal: To make every diner blissfully happy, usually through fun, but sometimes through quiet menu and service choices. They’d both worked at the restaurant since 2006. Five years later, they bought the place from their boss, Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group opened it in 1998. With EMP under their charge, they envisioned it as a guidepost for the future of lavish hospitality: warmer, wittier, exacting, but without the guests noticing any of the backstage sleight of hand.', 'And they wanted their restaurant to communicate the essence of New York. Look at their peers around the globe. The restaurants awarded three Michelin stars (like EMP) and also perched at the top of lists like the World’s 50 Best Restaurants (EMP is currently ranked number five) all express an exaggerated sense of place, their home-base cultures amplified to luxury extremes. Noma has its lichen fixation. The kitchen at Spain’s El Cellar de Can Roca has plated creations to resemble the Catalan landscape. Lima’s starry Central invokes Peru’s terrain in similar ways. Massimo Bottura of Emilia-Romagna’s Osteria Francescana may pull a modernist stunt or two, but local ingredients like Parmigiano-Reggiano and prosciutto still moor his cooking.', 'Squid poached with peppers and artichoke and tuna (skewered on a tuna bone) with cucumber gelee; spice-coated duck with lavender (photo: Nick Solares)', 'What most defines New York City food culture? It isn’t stirring topography or regional specialties with roots in the Middle Ages. It’s the assimilated immigrant foods, most recognizably the Ashkenazi Jewish deli classics and Italian-American comforts. It makes sense, for the global audience Humm and Guidara seek, that black-and-white cookies re-imagined with cheddar and apple may start a meal, or that variations on pastrami or tomato-basil salad or cheesecake occasionally show up in the repertoire. Perhaps the restaurant’s most identifiable New York trait is its willingness to adapt in order to stay on top.', 'Right now the partners seem to have arrived at a middle-path approach to the restaurant’s direction: reverential toward its city’s culture without being heavy-handed, effervescent in service but sidestepping flamboyance. The most interactive course was a seafood boil of lobster, shrimp, clams, and sausage simmered with potatoes, green beans, and corn. The staff spread the boil across butcher paper on the table and sprinkled over lemon juice and a fennel-paprika spice mix. It struck me as a savory counterpoint to the splatter-art dessert of sauces and brittles and crumbles at Alinea.', 'Most dishes veered toward more elegant forms, like a foie gras terrine crowned with a gingered, glossy peach dome. That fruit and spice combination was echoed in a mid-meal jaunt to the kitchen (a customary intermezzo for guests), where a pastry chef made us snow cones using an antique ice-shaving machine and flavored them with peach syrup, ginger, and bright lemon thyme.', 'Peach, ginger, and lemon thyme snow cones', 'With snow cones, with savvy beverage pairings, with unremitting enthusiasm, the staff made every attempt to ceaselessly delight. Google ""Eleven Madison Park"" enough and all sorts of stories show up about the lengths to which staffers have gone to surprise and enchant: They’ve retrieved Shake Shack burgers for picky eaters, they’ve imprinted family business logos onto beer coasters, they’ve matched up servers and customers who hail from the same home state. The restaurant actually employs people with the title ""Dreamweaver,"" whose job is to suss out exactly such  opportunities for magic.', 'All they needed to do to thrill me was present the tea menu assembled by team member Chris Day. His list lays out 50 choices. If you’re looking for a lovely cup of Earl Grey or chamomile after dinner, it’s there. But for obsessives like me, Day or one of his crew of five will wheel up a trolley and prepare, say, a 1960s vintage pu-erh or a rare oolong Gong Fu style — steeping an abundance of loose leaves in quick succession and serving the brews in small cups. I sighed over a high-elevation Taiwanese oolong, the flavors shifting from vegetal to tropical and the viscosity becoming ever creamier. My editor, with whom I’ve shared many meals, laughed at my joy and commented that she’d never seen me so happy. It was just the kind of remark that Humm and Guidara aim for every day.']"

But a young chef will have a heck of a time enjoying Grant Achatz's modernist cookery without visiting Alinea and plucking down $700 on a dinner date. And while none of this is to discount the importance of empiricism outside of cuisine (better to step inside Philip Johnson's glass house than view it from your buddy’s Facebook feed), with food you actually have to be there. You can’t eat via the Internet. Further limiting is the fact that the gastronomic game is a zero sum; your enjoyment of lemongrass-flavored ants at Noma (where von Hauske worked) will detract from someone else’s because the chefs there can only forage for so many insects, and because the restaurant only has so many seats."", 'Contra’s guest chef dinners are a way to make an elitist playing field just a hint more democratic', ""Perhaps these realities don’t register to full-time Instagrammers who crisscross the globe and eat still-beating reindeer heart every September at Fäviken, but for a knowledge-hungry cook earning $29K a year, a freelance food writer who doesn’t want to ask for a media rate, or an everyday eater who wants to expand her horizons, Contra’s guest chef dinners (and everyday dinners) are an essential alternative, a way to make an elitist playing field just a hint more democratic, a sign that it doesn't have to be tasting menus for the well-heeled and a la carte for everyone else.

Gorgeous."", 'Scallop with celeriac and pear and blackberry parfait', ""Sometimes Contra's food is visually precise. Slivers of white squid with black ink puree and yuzukosho greens would fit right in at the two Michelin-starred Aquavit. A scallop cut into the shape of a candy bar is an arresting rectangular alternative to the mollusk's circular comfort zone; even better is the accompanying scallop froth and coral shavings, which impart the entire preparation with a powerful oceanic musk. And then there's a single slice of tomato, edible still life in a tart bath of leche de tigre."", ""Sometimes the chefs are more relaxed in their platings. A collection of cherry tomatoes is haphazardly placed, though the concentrated tomato compote beneath is not. It sucker punches the palate with its agrodolce oomph. Mangalitsa pork is less about wowing the eyes as the palate; the meat's natural earthiness is revved up by shavings of piney matsutake. And von Hauske's brilliantly straightforward desserts, from almond ice cream topped with macaron crumble to a juxtaposition of passionfruit semifreddo and chocolate sorbet, would feel just welcome at an ambitious kitchen as at a ballpark."", 'A few minutes into a meal at Contra, I watch Stone do something rare for a chef: He leaves the restaurant mid-service — through the main entrance, no less. Later on in the evening, von Hauske scampers off too. And so does the beverage director. Do not be alarmed.

The kitchen takes raw yellowfin belly, cuts it with Korean chili flakes, tops it with sesame, scallions, and tomatoes, and then places the whole shebang over grilled bread. It's a spicy tuna roll, the bane of sushi purists, transformed into toast, the oft-mocked lifestyle choice of people who brunch in 2015. If the concept reeks of Dada-esque self-awareness, the execution is pure deliciousness: crystal clear notes of fish oil and spice, begging for a funky glass of sparkling rosé.

205,"['Nowadays, if you went looking for a Haitian restaurant you’d probably try Flatbush, Canarsie, or Marine Park. But in the 1960s, the area around 57th Street on Manhattan’s West Side was a Haitian stronghold. The area was called Bois Verna, after a neighborhood in Port-Au-Prince known for its ancient latticed houses. New York’s Bois Verna once boasted bookstores, churches, cafes, and bodegas called petit magasins. One of the only institutions remaining is Le Soleil (""The Sun""), a restaurant founded in the early 70s by Rolande Bisserth, cook and owner, on a busy stretch of 10th Avenue just north of 57th, where cabbies and limo drivers often double-parked to hurry in for carry-out.', 'In 2011, a new landlord and rent increase forced the long-running institution to close. But this is the rare restaurant real estate story that has a happy ending, because in 2013, Bisserth triumphantly reopened Le Soleil across the street and down the hill, still on 10th Avenue but now technically in Hell’s Kitchen rather than the Upper West Side. The new premises is far more handsome and well-appointed than the previous one, with peach-colored walls above brown wainscoting, with the same collection of colorful tropical landscapes lining the walls, mainly in the celebrated Haitian Primitive style.', 'The menu at the new place remains pretty much the same as the old one. Divided into two parts, the first lists a core of dishes always available, including the greatest hits of Haitian cuisine; the second offers three to five specials per day that run to Sunday’s beef tongue, Thursday’s guinea hen, and Saturday’s pizzle — bull penis. Approach at your own risk. Not all the specials are available on the days promised, but on any given day you’re likely to find a choice of 10 or so main courses from both parts of the menu, all displaying the same winning mix of French and African elements that characterizes Haitian fare.', 'Each of these set meals starts with a simple salad of tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers served with French dressing — you know, the orange, gloppy salad condiment that comes in a bottle. There’s nothing really French about it; how the dressing got to Haiti decades ago and was accepted as Gallic is anybody’s guess. Nevertheless, unless you secretly have a bottle of the stuff stashed in your refrigerator, eating a salad slobbered with it is at least an interesting novelty.', 'Above: Accra fritters; Below: Legumes with beans and rice and beans', 'As an aside, there’s only one appetizer: accra ($1 each). These elongated fritters are made with mashed malanga (aka cocoyam, yautia, or dasheen), a gnarled tuber of the elephant ear plant often seen in Latin groceries. Mixing malanga with black-eyed peas and scallions, these crisp brown fritters develop a creamy gray interior and taste twice as good if you spoon on the hot sauce called piklis, which sits in a jar on the table. Formulated with vinegar, chopped cabbage, and scotch bonnet peppers, it packs a prodigious wallop.', 'The national dish of Haiti is lambi, but many Haitian restaurants in Brooklyn no longer serve it due to spiraling costs. Here it remains king among entrees, though at $20 it’s also the priciest. Known in English as conch, and Italian as scungilli, lambi is the horny creature pulled out of the pink-lipped shell that you hold up to your ear to hear the ocean. The thing takes a lot of tenderizing to be palatable, and Haitian cooks are experts at it. At Le Soleil the shellfish is fricasseed in a vinegary pink solution as beautiful as the shell. It’s probably unlike anything you’ve tasted before and a big raw onion ring rides on top.', 'Other notable entrees include griot ($12), a confit of fatty pork chunks achieved by marinating the meat in sour orange and shallots, boiling them in the marinade until it evaporates, then frying the pork chunks until dark-colored and delicious. The same very French treatment is afforded goat (cabrit), beef (tasso de boeuf), and turkey (tasso dinde) with similar results. Pork is still the best, with turkey second. Love goat? On Wednesday and Sunday, it’s available in an orangish brown gravy (cabrit en sauce, $14).', 'If you’re really famished, go with the red snapper. Like the lambi, it will set you back $20 for a large specimen. The fish is fried head-on and whole, then strewn with onions. For lovers of plain seafood, it’s spectacularly fresh. On the other hand, vegetable adorers will select a dish with the generic-sounding name of legumes ($12). It turns out to be the most African dish of all: a glorious moosh of leafy vegetables stewed with a few carrots and beans, flavored with chunks of beef. Pour on the piklis.', 'Entrees come with rice and peas and a whole boiled plantain at lunch. At dinner you get fried plantains instead of boiled, and djon-djon rice colored an alarming shade of black, not in the Italian manner with squid ink but by boiling the grain with tiny, spindly black mushrooms native to Haiti called djon-djon. These impart color and subtle flavor, but the mushrooms themselves are removed after cooking because they’re too damn tough to eat. The djon-djon rice also contains lima beans.', 'Ultimately, the prime allure of Le Soleil may not be its French or West African elements, but the sheer size and generosity of its app and entrees, and the warmth of the welcome. If you’re a meat and potatoes person who likes plain fare expertly cooked, give the restaurant a try. There’s no way you’ll go away hungry, or much poorer.', 'Cost: Dinner for two, featuring salads and two main courses, $40, including tax but not tip.

A medium-bodied French or Italian red goes nicely with most of the entrées, though maybe bring a rose, festive fizzy white, or riesling for the lambi or red snapper. Lager or pilsner are great, beer-wise.', 'Bonus tip: Though every main comes with an introductory salad and copious sides, you may want to appetize by getting a couple of accra fritters (be forewarned they really fill you up), or by splitting an entrée as a starter.

206,"['Discovering some outstanding biryani on Kissena Boulevard.', 'Hyderabad is the capital of South India’s Andhra Pradesh region. Only twenty years ago this hilly city of seven million on the Musi River was in a state of decline, but recently it has undergone an economic uptick that has transformed the city into a tech powerhouse and kingpin of the call-center industry. (Yes, many of those annoying phone solicitations you get around dinnertime come from Hyderabad.) For a South Indian metropolis, it has an unusual history. Hyderabad’s culinary roots go back to the Muslim Mughal emperors of the North, who conquered Hyderabad in 1724. They brought with them some of their most delectable recipes, including biryani, a lamb-dotted rice casserole inspired by Middle Eastern pilaf — an unusual signature dish for a southern city.', 'You can get indifferent biryani in any of New York’s old-fashioned Punjabi restaurants, usually a greasy mountain of rice shot with tough morsels of meat and more raisins than you can shake a stick at. Often, it’s been desiccating on a steam table for days. Instead, whiz over to Hyderabadi Biryani & Chat, a sole Indian establishment among the Northern Chinese cafes and pizzerias of Kissena Boulevard. The restaurant occupies a boxy room with eight tables in the front and a steam table at the far end — the tubs are filled with things that actually improve with age, like palak paneer and goat masala. The room’s main decoration is a wall-size mural with color photos of the menu, which would make ordering easy if there weren’t so many difficult choices to make at this astonishingly good restaurant.', 'Bullet naan and gobi Manchurian', 'The biryani is some of the best in town, available in eight varieties. Rather than sitting on the steam table and drying out, it is assembled to order with freshly cooked morsels of meat and vegetables. Two of the choices are vegetarian, one also vegan. The rice is kept exceedingly fluffy, delicately flavored with ginger, garlic, and cardamom. The shards of meat, poultry, or seafood are tender, pleasantly fatty, and cut in pieces smaller than usual, the better to hide among the tan, yellow, and orange grains of rice. Deeply brown caramelized onions and bright green chopped cilantro and scallions are heaped on top; a lime wedge is provided on the side to further irrigate and sour the rice. By all means, squeeze it!', 'Maybe not surprisingly if you’re fond of the can-chewing quadruped, goat is a better call than lamb, and cheaper, too ($10.99 vs. $11.99). It’s more pungent and even slightly funky, very flavor-forward. The funniest looking is the egg biryani ($7.99), a vegetarian tour-de-force crowned with ivory ovoid humps of boiled egg. Crush them up roughly and mix them in with the rice before attacking. The most unusual is ""chilli chicken biryani,"" which features boneless poultry fragments colored an alarming shade of red. The chicken comes from Indian-Chinese cuisine (which probably originated in Calcutta’s Chinatown in the 1940s), and this biryani constitutes a fascinating culinary mash-up that you won’t find elsewhere.', 'Goat biryani', 'While the gigantic menu of Hyderabadi Biryani includes dishes from several regions of India, it spotlights several fascinating recipes from Southern Indian states. Best perhaps is Kerala pepper chicken ($9.99) from the southernmost tip of the South Asian landmass, where fish, coconut milk, and banana leaves figure into the everyday fare. This dish, however, deposits chicken in a bright tomato sauce tinged yellow with turmeric and flavored with aniseed and curry leaf, among many other spices. The main flavoring, though, which makes you sweat from the heat as you gobble the curry, is cracked black peppercorns. Using peppercorns rather than chiles indicates that this recipe probably originated before the 16th century, when the Portuguese introduced chiles to India. Not only is Kerala pepper chicken hot and historical, it’s also supremely delicious.', 'Other chicken recipes from Southern India include coconut chicken and chicken Hyderabadi (a variation on Chettinad chicken, invented by an ancient tribe called the Chettinars who, according to legend, migrated from India to Southeast Asia). Another Northern Indian flourish to Hyderabad cuisine is the passion for the yeast-risen flatbreads cooked in the tandoor oven called naans. The café offers seven; most compelling is the wonderful bullet naan ($1.99), which arrives glistening with oil and paved with minced jalapeños. They make the bread glow green and burn the heck out of your mouth. Named after a town on the Afghan-Pakistan frontier, Peshwari naan comes studded with dried fruit and nuts — you could almost eat it as dessert. Another potential dessert choice is the yogurt-based beverage rose lassi ($2.99), tinted pink with real rosewater. Some will love it.

The floors are carpeted, the throw pillows are plentiful, and the linens are more comfortable than the sheets you sleep in. It's not a foodie restaurant, it's just a restaurant. I don't say that as an insult – the Michelin star is merited – I say that as a reminder that this isn't a place where chefs double as waiters, where lilliputian proteins hide under canopies of Belgian endive, or where postprandial dollar pizza is a requirement for filling up.

Kreuther, by contrast, feels poised for longevity.

So how can such an ideal site be blighted? SenYa lies directly across the avenue from Sushi Dojo, which caused a furor two years ago when it opened, not only due to its piscine innovations and uni obsessions, but also as a result of its chief itamae's ethnicity.

Mostly eschewing clams and other shellfish, SenYa's omakase favors fin fish, which are often local and off the beaten path as far as the usual sushi selection goes. Served on two sequential pieces of slate, the sushi comes out pre-seasoned, so that no soy sauce, wasabi, or even ginger are really required.

Adornments are minimal, but include folksy woven baskets, spiky uni shells stuck on gray walls, and triangular arrays of tiny brass temple bells that seem on the verge of ringing. ""This is decorated as sparsely as a sushi bar in Tokyo, only it\'s bigger,"" said a friend who is an old Japan hand one evening. Two chefs pose behind the sushi bar, but omakases are not the only things to expect from them. (Be forewarned that service can be a bit fumbling at SenYa.)', 'Another highlight of the menu is the pressed sushi called hako (""box"") sushi, a variety made popular in Osaka that predates Tokyo-style nigiri sushi, and was once regarded as a form of preservation. The vinegared rice is pushed into a box called a battera (originally a Dutch word), with the fish carefully planked on top like wooden floorboards. Sometimes gelatin is added to help the sushi set. The lid is put in place and pressure applied. After it achieves firmness, the solid block is removed and cut like a cake into bite-size pieces. This sushi doesn\'t strive for the lightness of nigiri sushi, but flaunts its rich density. Of the three types offered, best is orange sea trout ($18), with skin that glistens a rainbow of colors. Covered with a haystack of fried burdock shreds, the conger eel (anago) is also worth trying.', '[Clockwise from the top: eel, sushi set, snow crab chawanmushi.]', '', ""There's a 13-piece plus maki roll sushi-sashimi assortment for $32, which is a spectacular deal, and also oddball sushi combinations and daily sushi specials, such as an opportunity to order five-piece sets of some of the rarer fish at prices ranging from $24 to $32. Some of the fish are imported from Tokyo, such as red-spotted masu salmon and kinmedai — golden eye sea bream. Sushi aficionados will find no lack of peculiarities and seasonal specials.

Usually these apps and mains are of an entirely predictable sort, featuring mundane choices like beef teriyaki, soba in soups, and Japanese-style fried chicken. Once again, SenYa reaches further into its grab bag of regional specialties to come up with some exemplary short dishes served warm. There's a smoked red snapper head ($8) — crunchy skin intact, served with grated daikon and a lemon wedge — that repays lots of thoughtful picking; and rock shrimp tempura ($12) which comes in a thin mustard-mayo glaze, but remains miraculously crunchy and sweet.

209,"[""A small, uncomfortable pizza place in the East Village is turning out the city's most delicious and exciting pies."", 'For many of us who grew up in the tri-state area, eating pizza was not something that happened in what could be considered a ""restaurant,"" and there was no talk of mozzarella di bufala or San Marzano tomatoes. Meals were paid for in cash. The guy at the register always had a Keith Hernandez mustache. And faded pictures of celebrities hung on the walls. The modern consumer of Neapolitan pies, of course, expects more in 2015, though it\'s unlikely anyone expects precisely how much more is in store at Bruno Pizza in the East Village. Bookshelves hold copies of the world\'s most serious culinary tomes: Modernist Cuisine. Manresa. Alinea. Tattooed cooks, working underneath lighting bright enough for a double kidney transplant, perform elective surgery on a plate of okra until it looks like a Cy Twombly composition. And bar diners listen, for five minutes at a time, to the Maserati hum of the Pacojet, a $5,000 blender in which all frozen treats are spun.', '[The pepperoni pizza with ranch dressing.]', 'Bruno is not an old-school pizza place. In fact it has more tricked out tools than some tasting menu venues. Too bad the dopest toy of all is out of sight and downstairs, a Meadows Mills stone burr. The machine grinds wheat berries from a collective farm near Ithaca into fresh flour, which is then used to make the restaurant\'s nouveau-Neapolitan pies. ""I think there is a lot of flavor potential in fresh flour that gets lost in typical AP flour or ‘00’ flour (the gold standard pizza flour) after it has been processed, bleached, bromated, and after it has sat in a warehouse, a boat, or a store shelf for a while,"" co-owner Demian Repucci writes in an email. This extravagance, along with the wood burning oven, was paid for the 2015 way: through a $30,000 Kickstarter campaign.', ""Repucci, along with chefs Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, with their nutritional yeast and bee pollen garnishes, really, really, really want you to know they're doing something more exquisite than the other pizza guys. And who can blame them? Pizza, like barbecue, is a white hot foodstuff whose evolution is limited by our own nostalgia, by our allegiance to how we ate it growing up, and by how little we spent on it. Pizza does not yet have its Alex Stupak, a universally recognized subverter, or its Thomas Keller, someone willing to push the refinement factor into the stratosphere."", ""Slojkowski and Gulino, who previously ran the set menu Box Kite on St. Marks, are willing to push the pizza envelope a little harder (haute ranch dressing makes an appearance) and place their pies amid a menu of composed dishes that could alone merit a crowd of destination diners. This is why Bruno, despite its flaws, is the most compelling and creative expression of a pizzeria since Roberta's opened in 2008."", ""Here's how to make the most of your experience here:"", '[Local squid with hatch chiles and charred onion; corkscrew pasta with smoked bone marrow, clams, collards.]', 'Going pizza-only is temping, but that would be a mistake at Bruno where the small plates, which look like curated forest canopies or tidal pools, wouldn\'t feel out of place at Aquavit or a fancy Danish flower shop. Squid, fortified with an aromatic dose of ""ocean-herbal"" sauce, finds its natural shellfish sugars amped up with slices of smoked and charred onion. Then the hatch chiles hit you. Time for a beer. Fairytale eggplant, roasted to the texture of slow-cooked bananas, derives its sweetness from cashew butter, its verdant bitterness from roasted shishitos. If the chefs put it all on bread, they\'d have an A-grade PB&J. And then there\'s compressed watermelon with lardo, roasted okra, pickled okra, and poblano emulsion, a sweet-sour-spicy-fatty affair that\'s straight up Paul Liebrandt — which is to say an outstanding combination of ingredients that no inside-the-box chef would think to put together.', ""David Chang, an original gangster in serving high-end (yet affordable) food in cramped, noisy spaces, would be proud of the Bruno boys. Surely no other U.S. restaurant utilizes a more painful counter stool. Designed by Repucci himself, they lack both lumbar and pediatric support. Your feet dangle and knock up against the poorly-spaced bar wall, and I'll bet Air Turkmenistan has more legroom than this. The lighting is cafeteria bright, meaning the environs are more conducive to food photos, less so to first dates, or lingering."", 'You don\'t tip at Bruno, where servers are paid an hourly wage. Such policies are increasingly common at tasting menu spots like Atera and Brooklyn Fare, but still rare at the casual, a la carte level. Amanda Cohen\'s affordable Dirt Candy is an exception in that regard, and Repucci\'s conversations with Cohen informed his decision to do away with gratuities at Bruno. ""We both agreed that tipping is racist, sexist, etc., and doing away with it seemed the best way to simplify things and potentially pay cooks a little more for all their hard work,"" Repucci says. The fairest way to eliminate tipping is by raising prices, a practice that lets diners know how much they\'ll spend without having to do any mental math. ""But then our prices would be 20 percent higher than everyone else’s."" Indeed, a service-included policy would push Bruno\'s margherita pie from $15 to $18. So instead, the restaurant levies a 20 percent administrative fee, which more or less functions as a mandatory tip. Will Bruno eventually go full-on service-included? ""I think eventually, as more restaurants move to no tipping, the consumer’s pricing perception will change and restaurants will be able to just have higher menu prices,"" Repucci says. Right on.', '[The margherita pie.]', ""The margherita pie, with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, is too often like a Beatles cover band – overly faithful to the original. Bruno tweaks things just a bit. Rounds of Caputo Brothers mozzarella sport a welcome, almost toothsome chew. This isn't milky mush; this is cheese, dammit. Then there's the fruit. The chefs use a blend of fermented and canned tomatoes, with the vine itself steeped into the juice, creating a marked pucker and a distinct vegetal perfume that's aggressively headier than standard pies. A whisper of garlic, a hint of dried clay pepper, and a wallop of basil stimulate and sharpen the palate, cleansing it for more pizza eating. This all lies on top of a gently sweet whole wheat crust the thickness of two credit cards, with just a hint of droopiness and – as is increasingly common in New York – no Neapolitan-style soupiness. It's as close to margherita perfection as I've encountered in over a decade."", 'If it\'s in season, try the country and peach pie, a clever sweet-savory combination that function as a Southern take on a pineapple-spiked ""Hawaiian"" pie. Or do the salad pie, which employs bottarga-topped, dressing-slicked greens as a samurai sword to cut the sugars of roasted cherry tomatoes and the fat of milky ricotta. Lamb pie, covered in coppa, is a clean expression of farmland funk. Pepperoni pie, in turn, introduces a wild card into the mix: ranch dressing, a high-end take on the fringe movement that involves Americans dunking their hot pizza in cool, spiced buttermilk. At Bruno, the effort is more subtle: the ranch is an elegant finishing touch, something to gently reduce the tang of the tomato, with a clean dill-infusion playing foil the porky sausage.', '[Rose geranium gelato.]', ""There's currently just a single offering on the sweets menu: Rose geranium gelato over blueberries and honey. You can skip all the condiments: you're here for the magic of the Pacojet, a Swiss piece of machinery that uses blades spinning at 2,000 RPM to break up any ice crystals in your custard.

210,"[""Amid our verdant culinary era where steaks are often made out of cauliflower, where veggie burgers are increasingly the burgers of choice, and where bacon isn't so much a porky slab as a tiny lardon at the bottom of a soup bowl, it’s sometimes hard not to look back upon the artery-clogged aughts with nostalgia. Those were the heady days when chefs of all stripes popularized techniques that made unhealthy foods unhealthier. Crif Dogs championed the deep-fried frankfurter. Per Se, using an old Alain Ducasse hack, folded whipped cream into its cheese-y risottos. Resto won accolades by smearing grilled cheese sandwiches with bechamel, swine belly, and aioli, while DB Bistro skyrocketed to stardom by stuffing its burger with foie gras. Sure, many of those dishes are still popular; it’s just that they're no longer at the heart of our leaner, quinoa-spiked zeitgeist. But rest assured, there are rebels hovering at the fringes, waiting to push the envelope in a meatier, fattier direction. Among the members of that clever minority is Oiji in the East Village, a beefy little Korean restaurant dishing out rice and potato chips that taste like they were larded up by a Michelin-starred amusement park chef."", 'Let’s start with the what Oiji\'s menu calls ""buttered rice,"" an understatement that evokes a Rockwell-esque image of dairy fat melting over simple white grains. As if! The kitchen takes cooked rice and fully soaks it in warm butter. Then, during service, the starch is toasted with beef braising liquid and a richer French butter. The flavor is startling; it recalls a cleaner version of the delicious yellow goo with which you douse your movie theater popcorn. On top of the firm grains lie a poached egg and a few slices of braised beef shank, packing a concentrated, bovine punch. It\'s all a gourmet version of the classic jang-jo-rim, a dish more commonly found in Korean school lunchboxes than a high-end restaurant. Order it.', 'Above: Honey butter chips and beef tartare; Below: Butter rice with beef shank and poached egg', 'The homemade potato chips, dead ringers for the kettle-cooked variety, are doused in uber-fatty French butter as well, and laced with a touch of honey and cayenne. It\'s a sweet, salty, crunchy side dish that essentially functions as the restaurant’s only dessert. Think of the candy-like crisps as a lighter, more uncomplicated answer to baklava, with the tuber acting as a fine stand-in for phyllo. A rep tells me that Oiji ""can hardly keep up with demand"" for the confection, which is based off of a mass-produced snack that spawned a Cronut-like craze in Korea this year. A small bag of those in-demand chips will cost $9 on eBay. At Oiji, they\'re $5.', 'Those two knockouts should give New York hope about the state of affordable, risk-taking, neighborhood restaurants.', ""Those two knockouts, part of a concise, meat-heavy, vegetable-lite menu, served at a reasonable cost (only two dishes rise above $18), in a tiny space (the dining area is smaller than the washrooms at big box Asian fusion joints) should give New York hope about the state of affordable, risk-taking, neighborhood restaurants. Chefs Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, who trained at Gramercy Tavern and Bouley, respectively, have challenged themselves to refine the comfort food of their native Seoul and beyond. In doing so, they've made Oiji one of the most exhilarating openings of 2015, not to mention one of the city's finest modern Korean restaurants."", 'Bimibap, the traditional meat and vegetable hotpot, is deconstructed into a rainbow of fillings — sweet beef, egg white, yolk, shiitake mushrooms, and carrots — all meant for stuffing into red and green rice blini.

Take a bite of the avant-garde taco and it seems to disappear on the palate.', 'Chil-Jeol-Pan (rice crepes with assorted condiments)', 'Such dishes are a reminder of how far Korean cuisine has come in Manhattan over the past decade, adapting to local palates and expanding past the DIY grilled meat, dumpling, and karaoke parlors of Midtown or St. Marks. David Chang’s Momofuku empire, while largely a collection eclectic American restaurants, deserves credit in this regard, for introducing a certain class of food-crazed Westerners to the joys of eating lettuce-wrapped pork, and for proving that large-format Korean fried chicken can merit luxury status with a $135 price tag. Then there’s Hooni Kim’s Danji and Hanjan, two trendsetters whose non-GMO meats command sizable crowds and higher prices than the cheaper commodity fare one finds in certain K-town restaurants. And the fact that the two-Michelin-starred Jungsik is still open proves that at least some folks are willing to spend $180 on Korean tasting menus. So while New York has maintained a somewhat complicated relationship with high-end Chinese or Mexican fare in recent years, the city has generally accepted ambitious, creative Korean cuisine with slightly more open arms.', 'At Oiji, ""we\'re taking dishes that our moms would cook for us at home, but elevating them to a higher level,"" the chefs tell me via email. Indeed, the seafood soup with crackling rice and mussels looks as rustic as anything in a neighborhood pub.

It's policy that goes against the reservations-light ethos of the casual gastronomic world, where good establishments more sensibly allocate seats to accommodate both plan-ahead diners and impromptu eaters in an effort to make their restaurants more easily accessible to all."", 'The good news is that waits for bar stools are short in these dog days of summer – all the more reason to indulge in a cool beef tartare, dotted in the traditional Korean style with sweet Asian pears, or a bowl of firm buckwheat noodles, sitting in a tangy, garlicky pool of pickled ramp juice and soy sauce. Move onto katsu-like fried chicken, with an ethereal crunch and neutral flavor, or pine smoked mackerel for an oily ode to the forest.', ""The East Village restaurant is a fine example of how smart culinary institutions are beginning to take their cocktail lists more seriously.

A tannic and fragrant potable that pairs well with the pine-smoked mackerel.', ""4. Hwayo Negroni: A traditional mix of sweet vermouth and Campari, but with shochu as the base spirit, instead of gin.

Allow me to explain.', ""Fish 'n' chips"", ""The preparation is traditional: white, beer-battered Icelandic cod with verdant peas and golden fries, the classic English tricolore that, to the chagrin of no one, evokes the Irish flag more than it does the Union Jack. The execution is stunning. The closest earthly equivalent would be a twice-fried Korean chicken wing, which is another way of saying this is no delicate tempura; the hefty, salty, golden crust takes on the puffy, three dimensional texture of a chicharron. It eats like a lobster, a treasure meant to be cracked open. Inside lies sweet flesh, the natural piscine sugars amped up by a mount of mushed and minted peas. It costs $21 and it's only available at lunch. Sure, there are healthier ways of eating fish, but that's not really what The Clocktower is about. And that brings us to point number two."", ""In a city that's justifiably become laser focused on a healthier and more casual style of epicurean enlightenment, where everyone (myself included) is addicted to shared plates, bar dining, moderate portion sizes, and vegetables seasoned with lilliputian bits of meat, Atherton provides the polar opposite. The Clocktower's idea of small plates appears to be a bunch of appetizers and its approach to vegetarian fare seems to be a trio of salads. Also: no dining is permitted at the bar. The restaurant's only true pasta dish this July is a wintry macaroni and cheese, a bevy of al dente rigatoni in a pool of cheddar and parmesan sauce, with bits of ox cheek for oomph and chanterelles for aroma.

Such classicism, giant portions, and an apparent aversion to seasonality confirms that The Clocktower belongs to a small collection of restaurants, like the red sauce-inclined Carbone or the souffle-laced Cherche Midi, that find their inspiration not from predicting the lean future of food but rather by tipping a hat to its indulgent past.

212,"[""Portland, Maine's restaurants are even better in the fall"", ""\n  The most compelling time to dine at Fore Street — long the grand dame of Portland, Maine’s ever-more-dynamic dining scene — is in the fall. I first ate at Fore Street last August and thoroughly appreciated my dinner, though I’ll confess that I didn’t quite grasp its legendary status. I remember salads electric with summer freshness and local seafood and meats brightened by the sunny hues of tomatoes, corn, stone fruits, and singular Maine blueberries. Every bite earnestly conveyed New England's high-season bounty. But in the same way that dining downstairs at Berkeley’s Chez Panisse can be simple to the point of dullness, the fish entrees and desserts in particular at Fore Street came off a little dozy. \n  "", 'I returned to Fore Street last month, and this time my appreciation deepened to adoration. Every aspect of the food and atmosphere resonated with the precise moment in the calendar. Walking in, the signature scents of spit-roasting chicken and steaks sputtering over the grill tempted profoundly. The dining room — a collage of timeworn, mismatched bricks and woods in a former warehouse — felt like shelter designed to ward off the spiraling temperatures. ', 'October’s gingered carrot purees, sweet potato and sage gratin, and savory apple griddlecakes matched the grilled and roasted meats and seafood with more elemental oomph. Even a chilled seafood plate seemed designed to thaw moods and bodies with its uplifting flavors: It included plump smoked mussels and the last of the season’s lobster (poached and served with garlic aioli) fished from Casco Bay viewed out the restaurant’s windows. A hunk of pork loin cut as thick as filet mignon satisfied with the complexity of a great steak, its charred and peppery edges giving way to gutsy meat. The twang of garlicky red cabbage sauerkraut beneath the pork made for an ideal autumnal grace note.', 'The interior at Fore Street; Pork with red cabbage sauerkraut and mussels in garlic almond butter', ""Finding Fore Street to be at its most spiritually attuned was just one of the deep pleasures of visiting Portland in the fall. As seasons go, it is nearly impossible to compete with Maine’s summer: the mild temperatures, the diverse topography at its greenest, the jutting coastline dotted with lobster shacks that go dormant as the foliage begins preening. The dropping thermometer and lack of crustacean temptations along the shoreline meant that it was easier to hunker down in Portland, especially before the snow moves in to bury its picturesque roadways. With the exception of Fore Street (where one should book two months in advance to avoid agonizing waits for a place at the bar or in the dining room's unreserved section), reservations are easier to snag most places this time of year."", 'Given its favor as a vacation destination, it’s widely known that the town has an astounding breadth of quality restaurants. And the options only keep growing broader and better. It is Maine’s largest city, though the population of the town proper only numbers around 67,000. In my 16 months of near-constant travel for Eater, I’ve yet to encounter a U.S. metropolis of its modest size where I eat more superbly.', ' In my 16 months of near-constant travel for Eater, I’ve yet to encounter a small U.S. metropolis where I eat more superbly.', 'Sam Hayward energized Portland dining when he and his partners opened Fore Street in 1996. He is among the pioneering chefs who began forging close ties with local farmers, fishermen, and other producers. Rob Evans, who had cooked at The French Laundry and Virginia’s equally luxe Inn at Little Washington, furthered the town’s burgeoning reputation when he took over laidback Hugo’s (perched on a prominent corner two blocks from Fore Street) in 1999 and gave it a high-end makeover. Evans differentiated himself from Hayward’s rustic straightforwardness with sous-vide playfulness and Maine ingredients sometimes accented with European or Asian flavors. Generations of Portland cooks trained in these two kitchens.', 'Almost two decades later, it is Portland’s array of cuisines from around the globe that astounds. It speaks to the sophisticated palates of food-savvy residents and visitors alike that so many of them serve such remarkably accomplished cooking. At Japanese restaurant Miyake, customers graze on small plates like tai snapper braised in dashi, sake, and ginger, or they settle in for a $70 omakase of sushi, sashimi, and dishes such as grilled uni or seared duck breast that would easily cost three figures in a larger city. At upscale-ish Greek stalwart Emilitsa, even a crowd-pleaser like chicken souvlaki is finely tuned: The rice pilaf underneath tingles with just the right amount of lemon juice. I’m still hoping that the Sicilian street snacks and billowy flatbreads like the\xa0ones served at Slab (which opened last year) catch on as national trends. I’m sorry I missed the sambusas and stewed cassava leaves at Chez Okapi, a Congolese restaurant that opened the week I was in town.', 'Rijsttafel (rice table), including halibut steamed in banana leaf at Tempo Dulu', 'But I did make it to Tempo Dulu, a white-tablecloth restaurant serving Southeast Asian tasting menus that launched in June in the newly renovated Danforth Inn, a mansion built in 1823. Dutch owners Raymond Brunyanszki and Oscar Verest went all in on the decor: edgy contemporary art, plush banquettes, extravagant flower arrangements. There are three options for dinner: a three-course menu for $67, a five-course meditation on lobster for $98, or (the one that most intrigued me) an $87 variation on Indonesian rijsttafel, the ""rice table"" tradition that developed during the 300 years that the Dutch ruled over Indonesia. Rijsttafel lives on most prominently these days as a specialty of Amsterdam\'s restaurant scene.', ""Few rijsttafel restaurants exist in the U.S., and Tempo Dulu's giddy abundance worked in the posh surroundings."", ""At Tempo Dulu, the meal began with green papaya soup and lobster spring rolls. Then the straight-backed servers marched out the main event: a spread of nearly a dozen dishes arranged in small bowls, including plenty of rice and the fiery condiment called sambal. Halibut steamed to suppleness in a banana leaf was the centerpiece. Chicken satay had a caramelized crispness that lifted the dish from its usual blandness. Only coconut-sluiced beef rendang disappointed; an overdose of lemongrass obliterated every other flavor. Few rijsttafel restaurants exist in the U.S., and the sense of giddy abundance worked in the posh surroundings. And at this time of year, the food's tropical sultriness whisks away the palate to warmer climes. If the splurge for dinner doesn’t appeal, at least swing by the bar to ogle the furnishings (especially the chandelier covered in what appears to be moss) and to savor the cocktails (tiki-esque but light on cloying sweetness) by Trevin Hutchins, one of the city’s most lauded bartenders."", 'The current richness of Portland’s culinary landscape — the cherished Maine ingredients mingled with the international reach of its dining options — manifests most rewardingly in the three restaurants owned by Arlin Smith, Mike Wiley, and Andrew Taylor. In 2012 the trio purchased Hugo’s from Rob Evans. They had been overseeing the restaurant as Evans began concentrating on Duckfat, a runaway success specializing in Belgian fries and sandwiches that Evans opened in 2005 with his wife, Nancy Pugh. The same year that Smith, Wiley, and Taylor bought Hugo’s they also took over the space next door to Hugo’s to create Eventide Oyster Co., a bar that muddles foods from Maine and ""from away"" in dazzling mash-ups: Pemaquid oysters glossed with kimchee or pickled ginger ices, a classic New England clam bake alongside green curry lobster stew, peekytoe crab rolls next to fried chicken buns topped with pickled watermelon.', 'And this past April, on the other side of Eventide, the three of them launched The Honey Paw, a casual hangout serving homemade pan-Asian noodles and other globetrotting comforts. The back of the block-long building they’ve effectively taken over now stretches into one extended mega-kitchen.', ""Smoked lamb khao soi at The Honey Paw and Tuna tataki with compressed cucumber noodles at Hugo's; Clam bake at Eventide"", 'Among the group’s trinity of restaurants, Eventide\xa0remains my favorite. I continue to marvel over how the menu nails an irresistible balance of tradition and innovation. (Crowds still occasionally spill out the door in the fall; go early or late.) That said, I enjoyed the other two restaurants mightily on this trip. The Honey Paw struck me as a restaurant that will be deeply useful to its community, a place to stop in solo for a lunchtime lobster tartine (beautiful with its blanket of radishes and hijiki seaweed and celery leaves) or for sharing bowls of Thai khao soi (potent with smoked lamb, coconut curry broth, fermented greens, and fried noodles) when winter descends. The lists of craft beer and unusual wines come off as skillfully calibrated as the food.', 'The group’s restaurants capture Portland’s specific strengths — a mingling of cherished Maine ingredients with international influences.', 'Smith, Wiley, and Taylor renovated Hugo’s but have otherwise maintained the levels of relentless creativity that Evans initiated. Categories of dishes focusing on meats, seafood, and vegetables define the menu, with diners encouraged to mix and match from each section to create two-, three-, or five-course meals. Choosing a volley of contrasting proteins paid off: fluke cured in umeboshi (pickled plum-like Japanese fruits) with translucent apple slices and crackly rice puffs segued to a hearty salad of duck tenderloin, gizzards, and liver punchy with mustard vinaigrette and then to gently smoked cod over potato puree and a clever, pleasantly rough sambal made from tomato skins. Taken together, the group’s restaurants capture Portland’s specific strengths — a mingling of cherished Maine ingredients with a port city’s receptivity toward international influences.', 'Breakout hit Central Provisions, which reaped heaps of national acclaim after opening in February 2014, also revels in a melting-pot approach to its food. The attention has made a seat at the restaurant (which doesn’t take reservations) nearly as hard to claim as at Fore Street. A friend and I arrived at 6 p.m. to be told the small dining room had just filled and the wait could easily stretch to over an hour.', 'We returned for lunch next day instead. The noontime offerings were a truncated version of chef Christopher Gould’s evening menu but still provided a gratifying tour of his signatures (with a table available immediately). We eased in with the bread and butter, a deceptively banal name for a dish that includes a white beer sabayon whizzed through an aerosol dispenser into the shape of a giant, tremulous egg yolk set over hazelnut butter. Spicy beef salad jolted with Sriracha; roasted bone marrow with horseradish delivered fatty, pungent happiness. The Bluefin tuna crudo, presented as tidily stacked dominoes with radish and mustard and sesame seeds, reminded me that I’d seen the fish at a surprising number of restaurants in Portland. I’ve certainly noticed its presence dwindling across the country in light of overfishing and its endangered status. But the restaurant receives the fish from the city’s Browne Trading Company, one of America’s most respected seafood purveyors. It sells fish caught wild from the Gulf of Maine, in limited catches and in season from June to October. At lunch that day Gould also had a plucky open-face tuna melt on the menu, a smart way to use the leftover fish.', ""Central Provision's tuna melt and exterior; dining room and Palais Royale burger at Palace Diner"", 'The tuna melt at Palace Diner is something else altogether. Between two toasted bread slices rests an inch-plus of iceberg lettuce that acts almost literally as box springs for a mat of not-too-creamy tuna salad. To savor it means leaving behind Portland’s cobblestone streets for a 20-mile drive south to the town of Biddeford. Last month the trees along I-95 practically lit the highway in their blaze of yellows and crimsons. By now their branches will be stark. Biddeford still merits the short jaunt, for both Palace Diner and for Rabelais, a national treasure of a cookbook store that specializes in out-of-print and rare tomes, some of which are hundreds of years old. Owners Don and Samantha Lindgren frequently travel at this time of year, so call ahead to make an appointment, even simply to browse or buy the latest Ottolenghi cookbook. ', 'Aim for mid-morning and visit Rabelais before or after Palace Diner, which is open only for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast, make it the deluxe sandwich, a beguiling combination of egg, bacon, cheddar, and jalapeño on English muffin that chefs and co-owners Chad Conley and Gregory Mitchell somehow elevate beyond the sum of its parts. Around 12 o’clock, order the tuna melt or the Palais Royale, a double cheeseburger stacked with patties griddled until the edges crisp.

213,"['In the 50s and 60s when Mumbai was still Bombay, teahouses were a large part of daily life. These shops, which numbered in the hundreds, were often run by Iranis, a group that had emigrated from Persia in the late 19th century. By the mid-20th century, the teahouses already had a worn colonial air, furnished with bent-cane chairs, high ceilings, giant blemished mirrors, and lazy ceiling fans, something like New York’s older French bistros. A place for friends to meet in advance of a movie or after a shopping spree, Irani cafes furnished Bombayites with a quick cup of chai and a plate of English biscuits long before the era of fast food. They also offered larger meals that constituted a mash up of Indian, Persian, English, and Portuguese influences.', 'Riding a wave of nostalgia, Irani cafes have recently re-emerged as a fad in other Indian cities like Delhi and Hyderabad, while a handful of much older establishments remain in Mumbai. Now, miraculously, one has appeared in Jersey City. It occupies the former Paratha Junction space on bustling Newark Avenue, the most important Indian shopping street in the metropolitan area. The color scheme is black and red; ladder-back chairs surround lacquered tables, and squarish sconces march along walls covered with cartoons and drawings. A window at shoulder height looks into a kitchen a half-floor higher, approached via a stunted stairway. Nevertheless, the place doesn’t go very far in evoking the décor of an Irani café back in India.', 'The place is run by a gentleman with the canine nickname of Fido; wearing a fez, he smiles down at you from the outside awning and will occasionally pop into the dining room in person to see how you’re enjoying your cup of chai. That Indian milk tea comes in four varieties. Irani chai ($3) is the signature, made with sweetened condensed milk and heavily scented with cardamom. It’s irresistible, if you like your tea thick and sugary. In the early 20th century, this version was reputedly sometimes doctored with opium, made possible by Persia’s primacy in the poppy trade. Fido’s Irani chai, alas, doesn’t contain any drugs.', 'Above: Chicken Parsi berry pulao, Irani chai; Below: Chicken salli', 'Cutting chai is brewed with green tea, so strong it’s administered by the half cup. Regular chai is gingery, and comes with the sugar on the side. Made with the dried herb, mint chai also arrives unsweetened and has a slightly bitter aftertaste. To go with your chai, English-style biscuits made in India are available. Order Krackjack ($1.50) and receive, not boxed caramel corn with roasted peanuts, but a queue of cookies wrapped in gold foil, salty and sweet simultaneously. Other packaged cookies include Parle G (aimed at kids), buttery and grooved Good Day, and Chocolate Bourbon. (""My grandmother used to eat those,"" an Indian friend noted enthusiastically.)', 'Other Irani-style snacks might startle you. Brun maska ($1.50) is a round French roll with a perfect crust that arrives so drenched in melted butter it dribbles onto the plate. Bun masaka is more like a hamburger bun. The word ""masaka"" doesn’t refer directly to butter, though. It means something more like ""buttered up,"" meaning that the sheer quantity of butter is supposed to flatter you. Brun omlette sides the French roll with a nice plate of veggie-dotted scrambled eggs, with raw onions and a couple of lime wedges on the side. It makes a splendid brunch if you happen to be in the neighborhood.', 'European-style bread is central to the cuisine of the Irani teashop.', 'Yes, European-style bread is central to the cuisine of the Irani teashop. Foremost among these is pav, an adaptation ""pao,"" the Portuguese word for bread. Here it designates a squarish domed roll that\'s something like a Parker House. It has made its way into a legion of Indian snacks. Vada pav ($5) is a baseball-size potato fritter mounted on the tiny roll and looking like an elephant sitting on a bicycle. The same roll also accompanies curries in lieu of rice, including the vegetarian daal fry pav (a flavorful lentil stew), and salli boti pav (a chicken curry topped with crisp potato shreds). How you eat these things is up to you, but making curry sliders is not the worst approach.', 'The vegetarian Atom bomb pizza', 'Mutton dhansak is a curry characteristic of the Parsis — another Persian group that arrived in India several centuries earlier than the Iranis. Mixing lentils and meat in a dark gravy flavored with mint, yogurt, mixed pickle, and chiles, this curry develops a powerful and fruity pungency. It is served pav-style at Fidos. The most Persian dish of all is a pilaf: poultry concealed in a glossy mountain of rice topped with slivered almonds and dried berries (chicken pulao, $10). If there’s a ""don’t miss"" dish on the menu, this is it.', 'The bill of fare offers two further specialties not normally part of the Irani café canon. Fido seeks to introduce kathi rolls to the New York area; he’s about 10 years too late. Nevertheless, the paneer tikka (roasted fresh cheese) and sukha gosht (dry lamb curry) are particularly worthwhile.

The prospective guests are milling about, smoking, complaining. ""We were told we\'d be next,"" someone shouts. The chef, who\'s doubling as the de facto bouncer, apologizes, and hands out cards for discounted drinks at Maiden Lane, a hip bar nearby that specializes in hand-canned sardines. ""Do you want to come in and eat or are you still upset?"" the chef asks an unhappy bloke whose table is finally ready. Inside, a projector shows Bollywood movies; staffers sing happy birthday; patrons queue up for the solo restroom; aromas of cumin waft through the air; Fanta-colored cauliflower leaves the kitchen; and waiters, within a minute of your being seated, tell you to help yourself to the beer fridge, a suggestion that\'s more apt for a frat party than the very good restaurant that Babu Ji is.

Another night, as I\'m walking a (floral, citrusy) Tank Farmhouse back to the table, a manager shucks off the cap with his thumb ring. Such impromptu bottle service is Babu Ji\'s contribution to the New York hospitality canon. Waiters open brewskis with the same diligence that a fine dining captain might pull out your chair or re-fold your napkin.

Right on.', ""There is no lack of good South Asian food in the greater New York City area – from Midtown's Pakistani cabbie buffets, with their polychromatic daals and meats in crimson oil, to Curry Hill's Southern Indian spots, with their shiny, gossamer dosas, to Jersey's City's Gujarati hangouts, bastions of vegetarian bliss, to Flatiron's Michelin-starred Junoon, with its crystal clear spices (and high prices). But Babu Ji, perhaps more than any of its peers, deserves credit for making a lot of us excited about Indian food for the first time since Floyd Cardoz opened Tabla with Danny Meyer in 1998."", ""Owners Jennifer Singh, and her chef-husband, Jessi, who ran a trio of Indian spots in South Australia before moving to Alphabet City, don't bend the rules as hard as Cardoz; there's no bacon naan or duck samosas.

But until that happens, I'll argue that an excellent fine-dining institution (which this mostly is) in an unexpected location can serve as a boon to the community. "", ""Thing is, it's not quite clear whether O Ya, with its set-menus and stratospheric prices, is actually making itself accessible enough to welcome (or warrant) a steady stream of regulars (or special occasional diners) from anywhere.

Smart diners will ask for seats at that counter and avoid the tables. Sushi, after all, is a performance art, and because each morsel is so small and ephemeral, much of the enjoyment comes from the build-up, from watching a chef slice the cool fish, anneal it, in an almost magical slight of hand, to a mound of warm vinegared rice, and place it in front of the guest. Good raw fish joints are compact enough to allow such spectating and interaction, while at larger ones, the chef will often reposition himself in front of the intended recipients."", ""That visual luxury, alas, isn't guaranteed at O Ya. Those sitting at the north side of the counter often won't see anything until a slice of hamachi with banana pepper mousse appears on a plate delivered by the server. It will still be delicious, with the pepper cutting through the fattiness of the rich fish. But it's sushi that's missing half its narrative, an admittedly nitpicky issue that nonetheless feels amplified at these prices. So the key is to request a seat at the south side of the bar, closer to where the action takes place."", ""New restaurants typically price themselves a few dollars less than their more experienced peers, as an enticement to hesitant diners and as a general act of deference as they work any kinks of their system. Then there's O Ya, which, when it opened in June, instantly become New York's third most expensive sushi spot after Masa and Kurumazushi.

And while that's less than what you'll spend in Boston, where the longer menu is $285, O Ya is still markedly spendier than in vogue sushi spots like Nakazawa ($150) or Shuko ($135-$175).

Such creative, seasonal preparations, finished with a tweezer application of thai basil or shiso, and flanked by rice whose marked softness never veers into mushiness, all evoke the more creative approach to sushi long espoused by Gari, Seki, and Nobu, as opposed to the more traditional and minimally-adorned fish purveyed by Ichimura or Masa.', 'O Ya\'s finest nigiri might be its garlic chive blossom omelet, which boasts an unusual whisper of beefiness.

Very clever.', 'The nice thing about dining at Shuko, just south of Union Square, is that both of its menus are compelling in their own right, a kaiseki experience that follows a series of small plates and hot dishes with an array of sushi, and a more affordable tasting for those who want an even longer parade of sashimi and nigiri and nothing else.

Where things go wrong is that $185 variant, the one that more entry-level eaters might opt for, is too quick, too abbreviated, with just nine or so pieces of sushi and a flurry of sashimi served so rapidly I could see the chef waiting to serve me the next one as I finished the previous course. There were no shaved foie gras spoons or shots of tomato shiso kombu water, two of the longer menu\'s more whimsical intermezzos, nor was there a proper mignardises service, a highlight of the $245 offering.

Shellfish stands out among the starters, with familiar pleasures like a Maine lobster cocktail, formed into a tower and surrounded by strange moats of mashed avocado that taste better than they look, and grilled shrimp over creamed corn and beurre blanc. There are 20 caviar variations (whitefish roe for $25 per ounce all the way up to $190 Osetra) and a charming, throwback Caesar salad prepared tableside. Seven cuts of steak dry-age in-house and ordering each involves a thorough discussion: How thick would you like your steak? To what degree of doneness, and how heavy on the charred crust? (A chart lays out all the options and corresponding cooking times.) Another relic from restaurant culture of yore: French onion soup (not worth filling up on), a basic salad, a baked potato, onion rings, and a daily changing selection of vegetables all come with the entree. But plenty of upgrade side dishes — creamed spinach with leeks, potatoes fried or mashed, truffle-laced creamed corn — tempt with their more refined preparations.', 'Bern’s was a whole-evening experience. At the center of it all, the steaks delivered.', 'All the ordering may sound tedious, but an elegant, ceremonious rhythm governs the dining rooms. At the center of it all, the steaks delivered. A Delmonico (aka ribeye) afforded the classic marbled pleasure, but I slightly preferred the porterhouse, which includes both filet and New York strip sections. The aging sharpened the meat’s individual qualities; the filet was taut rather than flabby and the strip, while not quite reaching blue-cheese funkiness, expressed fathoms of mineral tang. ', 'Dessert brought the themes of the evening full circle. We paid our bill (which includes a 12 percent service charge; that can slip by after several glasses of Burgundy) and then joined other guests for a tour of the kitchen and, more memorably, the tight, packed wine cellar, where we glimpsed bottles of Port and Madeira from the 1800s. Then it was up a flight of stairs for the finale: sweets in the Harry Waugh Dessert Room, named for Bern Laxer’s friend who was previously the director of Chateau Latour. The whole floor comprises 48 booths made of redwood wine casks; each table has a retro sound system you can tune to a variety of musical styles, including, naturally, a live pianist taking requests by phones attached to the stereo.

221,"[""Two extremes emerge at Jonathan Waxman's NYC holdings."", 'Following the departure of Jeremiah Tower in 1978, Jonathan Waxman went to work at Alice Waters’ Chez Panisse. It was already America’s most influential restaurant, the one where contemporary ideas about fresh, local, and farm-driven were first hatched. Waxman exited Berkeley and went downstate in 1979 to help found Michael’s in Santa Monica, one of L.A.’s most revered restaurants of the era. If you want to know what those early days were like, read Ruth Reichl’s Comfort Me with Apples, in which Waxman figures prominently. But these were mere prelude to what was to follow — his departure for New York in 1984, taking the seeds of the cuisine he helped create with him, and planting them in the rich soil of the restaurant scene here during one of its most opulent periods.', 'Founded in 1984, Jams was an instant hit, capturing not only the essence of California cuisine, but its insouciance, as well. The centerpiece was a grilled chicken-and-fries entrée that shocked everyone with its price tag of $23, but additionally causing a sensation were red snapper ceviche, crab cakes with corn-and-tomato salsa, and, especially, tiny pancakes served with smoked salmon, crème fraiche, and yellow whitefish caviar. New York had never seen a restaurant quite like Jams, causing Bryan Miller to coo in the Times, ""Of all of the trends that have sprouted in New York City in recent years, however fleeting, one that has thrown strong roots and become part of the landscape is so-called California cuisine.""', 'On this wave of approbation, Waxman opened two more restaurants in New York and another Jams in London. Then came the stock market crash of 1987, and suddenly high-rollers with expense account money drifted away, and Waxman’s empire was wiped out in the blink of an eye. The peripatetic chef returned to L.A. for a while, then reappeared in New York, where he worked behind the scenes on several restaurants without much visibility. At times he seemed only partly engaged in his restaurant career, staying out of the spotlight for years at a time.', 'Finally, his fans cheering on the sidelines, he dove into the pool again, opening Washington Square Park in 2002 on Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Of it, Bobby Flay — a Waxman protégé — enthused in a New York Times interview, ""When I walked into the restaurant the other night, it seemed like it was Jams in the year 2002, elegant but casual. He has his open kitchen again. He always had all-star teams working for him, fabulous cooks."" The next year Waxman opened Barbuto (""beard"" in Italian) on the ground floor of Industria Superstudio, a complex of photo studios aimed at the fashion industry, on the southern edge of what would become known as MePa.', 'Washington Square Park is now long closed, but Barbuto persists. And just this year Waxman opened a new Jams, just off the lobby of 1 Hotel Central Park. Now, with two restaurants in New York at the same time, it’s beginning to seem like 1984 all over again. I decided to visit both to see what an older, mellower Jonathan Waxman (he’s now 65) was up to at this moment in time.', '[The dining room at Barbuto]', 'When I visited Barbuto with Ruth Reichl, Jonathan Gold, and a table of Gourmet writers and editors a year after its opening, it was one of the city’s glitziest scenes, a sort of Studio 54 meets Balthazar, made infinitely more exciting by the surrounding neighborhood’s darkness and the faint odor of tallow. Not only did models mince down the adjacent ramp from the overhead studios, they were seated among us in skimpy dresses, their lips glinting with lip gloss. Nowadays the crowd is older and stodgier, many of them condo dwellers and townhouse owners from the surrounding hood, but the restaurant is still thronged at all hours, and reservations must be made weeks in advance.', 'Served with an Italian salsa verde redolent of anchovies and capers, the half chicken is every bit as good as it ever was, perhaps better.

Served with an Italian salsa verde redolent of anchovies and capers, the half chicken is every bit as good as it ever was, perhaps better.

It’s a big bird.', 'My second favorite thing came as a surprise. A kale salad ($12) featured the intransigent leafy vegetable chopped so fine that it slid down the gullet smoothly, its slightly bitter edge concealed by plenty of salty pecorino and saltier anchovies, with a squirt of sweet honey. Notably ungreasy stuffed clams, with some golden raisins in addition to the usual bread crumbs and pancetta, and fried calamari with a minimum of breading, were other standouts.', ""[Top: chicken with salsa verde.

Waxman’s bucatini all’ amatriciana ($21) is one of the best versions ever tasted, each perforated strand carefully coated with a bright sauce made with fresh Jersey beefsteak tomatoes, a sprinkle of grated pecorino on top nailing the flavor. This is Italian cooking with a California twist, a cuisine that L.A. chefs like Nancy Silverton, Wolfgang Puck, and Mark Peel (one of Waxman’s associates at Michael’s) have been exploring for decades, and one to which Waxman has added impressive innovations of his own.', 'Yes, over the years Barbuto has only gotten better, with a practiced crew in both the front and back of the house who have learned every trick to what makes a restaurant great. And the recent sale of Industria Studios, leaving the fate of Barbuto up the in air, means making what may be a last visit only more imperative. One caveat: the noise level, with tinkling glasses and voices dialed up to a shout, can be almost unbearable, but the food is worth every decibel.', '[The dining room at Jams.]', 'Is it possible to successfully duplicate a great restaurant from the past? Apparently not as far as appearance goes. While the original Jams was situated on two floors of an elegant Upper East Side townhouse, the current version is a drafty U-shaped space within sight of the registration desk of a Midtown hotel. Jams is now classified as an amenity, like a lobby with wifi or a spa in the basement. The high-ceilinged room is attractively lined with wood and hung with Edison light bulbs, and the chairs that surround a multiplicity of square tables have a groovy 60s feel to them. Shelves of alcohol bottles are positioned above a long, long bar, solving someone’s storage problem. An open kitchen lurks in the deepest recesses of the restaurant.', 'But the biggest challenge facing the recreation of a hit restaurant from the 80s is us. Our tastes have collectively changed since then, principally through the incorporation of culinary principles espoused by Waxman and his California pals 30 years ago, now incorporated into every menu in town and become keystones of the foodie philosophy. Soon after Jams 2.0 opened, I sat there with a bunch of colleagues from Eater (including three critics, who managed to remain anonymous) and pondered this truth, as we ate our way around the menu. We paid special attention to the handful of dishes that had been transferred nearly intact from the original menu at Jams.', 'The blinis and smoked salmon ($25) were there with bells on, three pancakes that might have come from I-Hop topped with a curl of smoked salmon and little heap of caviar, flooded with corn sauce. The app was still tasty, but over the decades had lost its ability to thrill — such a once-shocking juxtaposition of ingredients has now become commonplace. It set us wondering if the smoked salmon used at the original Jams might have been sourced at Russ & Daughters or Barney Greengrass.', 'The worst dish of 11 sampled was a bone-in pork chop cooked like wiener schnitzel, overcooked, really, into an almost-burned toughness. ', 'Our meal dragged on for nearly three hours that evening, as a result of both wavering service and confusion in the kitchen — into which we could see with perhaps too much clarity. More than once we endured a 30-minute interval with no food brought out at all. The dishes readily divided themselves into good and awful. An ample bacon cheeseburger ($21), named after the restaurant and listed as a bar snack, was fat and juicy and required frequent visits to the cloth napkin, while an oblong pesto-and-goat cheese mini-pizza tasted more Greek than Italian; it was delicious, though, with its smoky crust. Squid ink rigatoni with crabmeat was too al dente, the underdressed noodles black and glistening with not enough crustacean. The worst dish of 11 sampled was a bone-in pork chop cooked like wiener schnitzel, overcooked, really, into an almost-burned toughness. The top was heaped with random wet ingredients that only served to make the crumb coating mushy. Sadly, it had once been a good cut of meat.', 'Hoping that the inept cooking, at least, was the result of opening-month jitters that would be remedied as they place settled into a groove, a friend who’d been there on the first go-round and I revisited seven weeks later, sneaking in at 5:30 and sitting in the barroom just off the hotel lobby, since reservations had become nearly impossible to obtain. The service was superb but the food even worse than before.', '[Top: pork belly tacos. Bottom: pork chop (left) and squid ink rigatoni (right).]', 'Though ordered medium rare, the hamburger we’d once loved was now cooked almost to a cinder. The butternut squash chowder came freighted with potatoes, forcing us to poke around in the small bowl hoping to find cubes of squash. The calamari arrived on a piece of burned toast; the cephalopod might have been rubber bands. The tiny pork belly tacos ($19), though, were thoroughly delicious — accompanied by one teacup of smashed avocado and another of pico di gallo made with perfect ripe tomatoes. The biggest disappointment was an entrée called mezze ($23), which connotes a set of Greek or Middle Eastern starters that often include baba ganoush, hummus, and tabbouleh. In this case it was a grilled slice of eggplant, half a grilled summer squash, a lackluster grain salad, and little else.']"

Back in 1992, it concocted the head-spinningly potent, barrel-aged Triple Bock, followed a decade later by the port-like Utopias.

Dry, earthy, grassy and complex, saisons were grade-A refreshments, Gatorade that gave the workday a little glow.', 'Since its inception, the farmstead style has become a blank movie screen, accepting of brewers’ endlessly unique projections. Some saisons are floral featherweights, others strong and spiced with peppercorns, guava or even chocolate. You can funk a saison up with wild yeast, or make it smell like a field of spring flowers. There’s no right. There’s no wrong. But there’s only one Saison Dupont Vieille Provision.', 'The hazy golden saison is highly complex, snappy and effervescent, citrusy and spicy, with echoes of bubble gum and a trumpet blast of bitterness enduring long after your last sip. ', 'Since 1844, a little farmstead-brewery in Tourpes, Belgium, has been making beers of the most wonderful sort. Today, Brasserie Dupont (it commenced brewing on the farm in 1950) marries peerless craftsmanship with stylistic dexterity. Its family of beers veers from woodruff-laced Posca Rustica to fruity and roasty Monk’s Stout, low-alcohol Avril table beer, and strong and golden Moinette Blond—the brewery’s top-performer in Belgium. Across the Atlantic, Dupont is celebrated for saisons, including the organic, herbal Forêt and Avec les Bons Vœux, a zesty, lemony and wonderfully warming Christmas brew.', 'However, I’m here to discuss Saison Dupont. The corked-and-caged farmhouse ale is fashioned with the brewery’s whistle-clean filtered well water and, most crucially, a hearty yeast strain that’s legendary in brewing circles. The microbes are madly ravenous, devouring most every sugar morsel so that the beer, despite its 6.5 percent ABV, is drier than California tinder. The hazy golden saison is highly complex, snappy and effervescent, citrusy and spicy, with echoes of bubble gum and a trumpet blast of bitterness enduring long after your last sip. In short, it’s the ideal desert island beer.', 'That’s easy to forget. With tens of thousands of beers clogging the marketplace, even legends are often overlooked for flashy new things. However, Brasserie Dupont has provided a compelling reason for a revisit, recently releasing the limited-edition Saison Dupont Cuvée Dry Hopping. For each version (this is the third), master brewer Olivier Dedeycker aromatically gooses the saison with a unique\xa0hop, this season being England’s Minstrel.', 'Gone is that spicy, herbal note, replaced by ripe berries and orange peel. The tweak is a total treat, building upon the saison’s structure and supplying a fresh, exhilarating edge. Cuvée Dry Hopping is a classic song, remixed into a new hit.']"

During high school and college, canned beer wasn’t cool: It was a means to a slurring end.', 'Better beer was in brown bottles, the glass encasing pale ales, stouts and other pleasures outside my price range. After exiting that four-year blur with a bachelor’s degree in magazine journalism (bless you, Southeastern Ohio college), I also graduated to finer beer, bottled beer, the first stumbling steps as a writer with an intoxicating career.', 'As I fell down the fermentation wormhole, covering craft from every angle, I noticed that brewers were increasingly engaging in a kind of lowbrow cultural appropriation, cladding full-flavored ales in aluminum. There’s a litany of earth-first, business-savvy reasons why, but here’s the\xa0tl;dr: cans block light and oxygen, ensuring beer stays fresher, longer. Oskar Blues, with Dale’s Pale Ale, was a trailblazing metal head,  in time followed by new-breed breweries such as Chicago’s Half Acre, along with OGs including Sierra Nevada, Sam Adams and New Belgium. (According to industry chronicler\xa0CraftCans.com, 500-plus breweries now can beer.)', ""With mass acceptance for canned beer, served at high-end restaurants like New York City's\xa0Lupulo and Virgin Airlines alike, you might think that every brewery would climb\xa0aboard the aluminum bandwagon. They are. They aren’t. Canning equipment can be pricey, like Lamborghini expensive, especially when pumping out mass volumes. Moreover, for entrenched brewers busting at the capacity seams, it’s often physically impossible to shoehorn in a canning line. Way I see it, brewers face two options: First, they can enlist a mobile canner, who totes equipment to the facility. Second, they can build a new brewery and install a spanking-new canning line. Pennsylvania’s\xa0Victory Brewing opted for door number two."", 'Courtesy of Victory Brewing.', 'Contemporary American hops, name-checking Citra, Chinook and Simcoe, supply rousing aromas of Pacific Northwest pine trees, tropical fruit and lemons.', 'Back in 1996, elementary school buddies Ron Barchet and Bill Covaleski rebooted a Pepperidge Farm factory as a brewery, specializing in fresh, carefully constructed versions of European styles, done with American verve. That meant a hella refreshing Munich-style helles lager, Oktoberfest-appropriate Festbier and Prima Pils, an aromatically goosed, gorgeously bitter pilsner that’s one of my desert-island drinks. Victory also does well by the Belgians, with the Golden Monkey tripel and saison-inspired Helios Farmhouse Ale, and IPAs. I’m looking at you, HopDevil.', 'When I first drank the amber-toned IPA, sometime in the early ’00s, it was a depth charge to my taste buds—earthy and spicy, piney and caramel-sticky, full-bodied and old-man bitter. The beer tasted rousingly innovative. Until the rest of the brewing world caught up. Today, nearly every brewery aiming to stay fiscally afloat makes an IPA. Taste profiles have shifted toward citrus and melons, papayas and lychees, with immoderate bitterness fading from favor.', 'More to the point of my narrative: IPAs are now commonly found in cans, especially cultish quaffs like Other Half’s All Green Everything, the Alchemist’s Heady Topper and Pipeworks’ Ninja vs. Unicorn—yes, you want to\xa0see the can art. Cans are cool. And with its newly opened second brewery, in Parkesburg, Pennsylvania, Victory installed an Italian-built canning line capable of spinning out 150 cans a minute.', 'Into aluminum went Summer Love, Victory’s lemon-smacked blonde ale, then the earthy, citrusy Headwaters Pale Ale. This fall, Victory decided to can an IPA, settling not on HopDevil but a new creation, one aligned for modern times. Anointed Vital, and only available in cans, the IPA deviates from the HopDevil script. Whereas its predecessor is ruddy and berserk with bitterness, Vital slithers out (yup, I spill my canned beer into glassware) a see-through gold, filtration at its finest. Contemporary American hops, name-checking Citra, Chinook and Simcoe, supply rousing aromas of Pacific Northwest pine trees, tropical fruit and lemons. The flavors ride a similar road, but I’m most struck by the bitterness: clean and steady, humming along but never overwhelming, persistent after the dry finish.']"
226,"['Paul Fehribach had me at circa — as in ""Old Virginia fried steak, circa 1824."" The Southern menu at Big Jones, Fehribach’s restaurant in Chicago, includes a few modern standards like pimento cheese and shrimp and grits but also many rarities inspired directly from period cookbooks and texts. The ""steak"" (technically veal from pastured calves) was based on a recipe plucked from Mary Randolph’s The Virginia Housewife, published in 1824. Pounded and breaded, it splayed across the plate resembling a three-dimensional map of a small country with ragged borders. Hills of creamed barley and lakes of sherry-scented onion gravy dotted its knobbly topography. Scattered tufts of shredded scallions deflected some of the richness. Really, though, richness was the point.', 'The whole thing came off like country-fried steak’s genteel grandpappy, exactly as Fehribach intended. He’d been frustrated by his initial attempts at bending today’s country-fried steak to his will: He wanted an elegant sirloin cooked to hot pink; his customers clamored for the thin, crisped, cooked-to-hell hubcap popular across the Cotton Belt. The delicate cutlets detailed in Randolph’s book became a happy compromise, satisfying Fehribach’s proclivities as both a chef and historian.', 'Other Big Jones standouts (""Savannah Fish Fry, circa 1910,"" ""Potted Guinea Hen, circa 1840,"" ""Chicken and Dumplings, circa 1920"") come with similar back stories. It was Fehribach’s historical approach to the cooking that persuaded me to break a pattern: As a Southerner, I’ve rarely dined in Southern restaurants outside the region. I’ve sidestepped celebrated places like Boston’s Hungry Mother, where Virginia native Barry Maiden serves deviled crab and angel food cake with peach-bourbon caramel, or LA’s Hart and the Hunter, which reportedly turn out biscuits light enough to levitate. My thinking went: Why devote stomach space to foods I can find back home? If I resided in Milan, would I travel to New York to eat osso buco and saffron risotto?', 'Virginia fried steak with creamed barley and sherry-laced onion gravy', ""But at Big Jones, I found immortal Southern dishes rarely prepared these days in my own region’s ambitious restaurants. In the South, including in its dining culture, a tension has long existed between romanticizing the past and forging the future. The region's thinking chefs grapple with the contradictions meaningfully. Through our thick and often ugly history, our cooks of many races produced America’s most distinctive cuisine. The first successful English settlement established itself in what became Jamestown, Virginia in 1604; we have the country’s longest chronicled culinary legacies. And the kitchens of yore produced place-specific creations that are wholly delectable and adaptable: the Colonial cornmeal souffle of sorts called spoonbread, for example. Or the bacony fish muddle known as pine bark stew. Or the myriad coastal rice dishes. Or trifles boozy with fortified wines for dessert. (And that’s only a starting rundown.) It’s a home-cooking lineage worthy of reclamation and celebration in our restaurants."", ""Beyond New Orleans, where centuries of Creole and Cajun cultures continually influence the food, only a couple of high-profile chefs in the South notably enlace the past and the present in their cooking. At Charleston's Hominy Grill, Robert Stehling prides himself on Lowcountry throwbacks like shrimp bog (a jambalaya-like mix of rice, sausage, seafood, and vegetables) but also throws in zingers like pimento cheese layered with fried onions on a pretzel roll. Sean Brock famously became an heirloom seed preservationist as his career evolved. At his Husk restaurants, old and new ideas intermingle effortlessly: Rice griddle cakes might begin a meal featuring ham braised in Cheerwine soda or pork loin embellished with ramp sauerkraut."", 'Couldn’t a few more chefs draw more closely on the South’s vast and wondrous culinary repertoire?', 'In Atlanta, where I live, the most accomplished Southern-leaning chefs lean toward looking forward. They may collect antique cookbooks and rotate a classic coastal dish or two through their menus, but their visions of Southern food are modern. Stephen Satterfield at Miller Union, for example, combines braised rabbit with sugar snap peas and oyster mushrooms; a dash of rhubarb chutney on the side adds an extra, heady dash of springtime. At Restaurant Eugene, Linton Hopkins introduces foie gras to creamed hominy and fermented collard greens. These plates may not have colloquial names like ""hoppin’ John"" and ""reezy peezy,"" but they certainly taste of the South.', 'These chefs sing contemporary hymns to the region, and that’s commendable. It speaks to the creative liberation that restaurant kitchens have experienced in the last few decades. Southern foods, like cooking traditions all over the world, continually progress. And yet. Couldn’t a few more chefs (particularly outside of Louisiana) draw more closely on the South’s vast and wondrous culinary repertoire? Could the ""receipts"" detailed in those old tomes appeal to today’s educated palates? Could they be presented in ways that didn’t evoke a Colonial Williamsburg reenactment?', 'Fried chicken with sweet potato hash and greens', 'Sitting at a table in the front window of Big Jones, breaking off pieces of cakey Sally Lunn bread and swiping them through the sherry-laced gravy, I saw that perhaps an outsider with some distance and impassioned interest might more easily curate the South’s culinary legacy. Fehribach grew up around the wooded terrain of Jasper, Indiana, less than 75 miles from Louisville. His family served fried chicken at gatherings; biscuits and homemade jams were typical at meals. Fehribach was an early history buff. As an adult cook, a trip to New Orleans sparked his curiosity about Southern food. Subsequent research showed him that the vegetable-dependent cooking of the Appalachian highlands didn’t overly differ from the foods of his childhood.', 'In The Big Jones Cookbook, engrossing and just-published, Fehribach writes:', 'Of course, Chicago served as a beacon city during the Great Migration of African-Americans away from the South last century. Until recently, though, when modernized Southern cooking became a national darling, much of food traditions brought by those generations of newcomers remained isolated to soul food cafeterias on Chicago’s South Side. Part of the motivation behind Fehribach’s researched approach is to acknowledge the many diverse hands that have made Southern food the glory that it is.', 'All this can be a lot to bring to the dinner table. Time for a drink, maybe? How about a licorice-tinged Sazerac, or perhaps some ""Milk Punch circa 1721,"" woozy-sweet with Cognac, rum, whey, lemon, and sugar and finished with grated nutmeg? Such cocktails make a gracious start to a meal in Big Jones’s long, narrow dining room, lined with handsome woods and old-timey wallpaper with white and lime-green swirls. Order coush coush, spheres of fried cornbread glazed with honey and served with vinegary pepper sauce, to stave off hunger while looking over the rest of the options.', 'In an age of charcuterie ubiquity, Fehribach’s efforts with Louisiana standards like slow-smoked andouille and silky tasso ham nonetheless stood out. Extra props to the rustic, cobbled texture of his potted guinea hen, nicely offset by a swipe of quince ketchup. The andouille showed up beside chicken in a gumbo whose roux was so chocolate-brown and smoky that even a Cajun chef like Donald Link would likely nod with approval. Fehribach’s long-simmering fascination with New Orleans surfaced again at dessert time with an admirable rendition of calas, Creole sourdough rice fritters once sold by vendors on the streets around the French Quarter.', 'Above: Boucherie board (including andouille sausage, tasso ham, and potted guinea hen); Below: Collard green sandwich on corn pone with cheddar and calas (rice fritters) with ice cream', 'To be clear, not every aspect of Fehribach’s menu glares into the murky past. A Lowcountry soft-shell crab special came with a risotto-like perlau dyed emerald from ramp greens and a mound of Sea Island red peas (a South Carolina legume lately popular again with Southern chefs) with a pat of butter atop melting slowly and sweetly. The novel-seeming collard sandwich, glossed with melty cheddar and homemade mayo between layers of moist slabs of cornbread, takes its cues from a concoction favored by the Lumbee Indians in North Carolina.', 'Fehribach credits reading The Taste of Country Cooking — written by Southern doyenne Edna Lewis — with deepening his approach to the food at Big Jones. Lewis served as muse for the restaurant’s clamored-after fried chicken. It bubbles in a combination of lard, ham drippings, and clarified butter. A similar mixture gives the famous fried chicken at Watershed in Atlanta its distinctive porky savor; Lewis developed the recipe with her protégé Scott Peacock, who was the chef at Watershed for a decade. Fehribach’s take tastes entirely different from theirs (he throws cornmeal into the coating, for starters), but it’s a delicious testament to how cooks can riff on similar recipes to make something uniquely their own.', 'The cooking at brunch — Edna Lewis’s popovers, an unblemished Creole omelet with crawfish and cream cheese, comforting spoonbread cooked in bacon fat per an old recipe from Charleston — left me equally contented. Having scanned the menu online, I knew before arriving that I’d be ordering ""Eugene’s breakfast in Mobile, circa 1930."" Fehribach conceived the sustaining heap of fried catfish, brown rice, black beans, plantains, and green tomato relish as an homage to raconteur and Alabama native Eugene Walter, who wrote American Cooking: Southern Style for the Time-Life Foods of the World series. Walter, who died in 1998, was also a culinary historian who penned the joys of bourbon cocktails 20 years before the recent revival and studied 19th-century recipes full of spices like fenugreek that arrived via Mobile’s lively port trade. If Walter had known of Fehribach\'s endeavors and tasted his context-rich cooking, I\'ve no doubt he would have embraced him as a rightfully adopted son of the South.', 'Cost: Southern breads $5-$6, snacks and appetizers $7-$11, sandwiches $12-$15, entrees $14-$25, desserts $9-10.', ""Sample dishes: Popular favorites like fried chicken and pimento cheese are indeed wonderful, but be sure to look beyond the familiar to try Paul Fehribach's renditions of historic Southern recipes.

Seekers relish the image of the charming find in a tiny town where obscure magicians conjure unimaginably delicious food at stoves steps away from a secret garden.

I’ve instead found polite souls serving earnest food that’s a boon to an underserved area and usually hews to culinary trends about 10 years past their height in the nearest metropolis.', 'Knife & Fork, despite its banal name, is the rare exception — an actual destination-worthy restaurant. It resides in the small town of Spruce Pine about an hour northeast from Asheville in the thick of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Spruce Pine’s population is below 2,500.

It was a Wednesday in early May; the spare dining room (sage and green walls, chairs with wicker backs around simple wooden tables) was nearly empty. Most of the diners had instead gathered around smoky gray picnic tables on the restaurant’s garden patio.', 'Nate Allen, the restaurant’s owner and head chef, was pulling service duty that night as well. Allen cooked for 10 years in Los Angeles at restaurants like A.O.C. and as a private chef for Hollywood stars whose identities he won’t confirm (his rumored clients included Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire). In 2009 he and his then-wife Wendy relocated from California to be closer to her family in western North Carolina, where Allen also has relatives. As a cook, Allen had been yearning for a climate more closely tied to actual shifting seasons. Selling alcohol in restaurants had just become legal in Spruce Pine that year.

But over time his cuisine has evolved into a more modern and personal expression: He might fold in global nuances, but the ingredients largely hail from the region, most strikingly in the form of wild fauna that liberally peppers his dishes. The staff could easily present field guides along with the menus.

He enthused about how the sturdy, sharp green known as stonecrop holds up to heat as a finishing touch to rabbit loin with black radish and ramps. He rhapsodized over the slight nuttiness of an herb called Solomon’s plume served alongside zippy sochan, another springtime green, to accompany our grilled pork chop. Often the leafy additions are as much for the eye as for the palate: A slice of washed wind tomme from Vermont (Allen allows himself shipments of cheese from Murray’s in New York) came camouflaged among tender spruce tips, lemony sumac, and wood violets.

228,"[""When seeking culinary inspiration back in the mid-aughts, I'd often ride the polished escalators up to the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center and peruse the daily menus at Per Se, ogling dishes that lucky guests would enjoy in the cushy, coddled, quiet dining room. The preparation that fascinated me most of all was a 48-hour brisket; I’d heard Thomas Keller was doing cool things with sous-vide cookery, creating the possibility of magical medium-rare braises, imparting fascinating color and textural contrasts to cuts that should've come out uniformly brown. How did the meat taste? Couldn’t tell you. The $210, service-included price (before supplements), was too high for this young writer. So it wasn't until a few years later that I got my fix, not at Per Se but at David Chang’s $85 Momofuku Ko, where a high-tech water bath treatment left my short ribs gorgeously pink. There were no supplements at Ko. There was also no coddling. The setting was a cramped East Village counter. The first course was a pork rind. And the entertainment was listening to chefs drop f-bombs as they sent the last course – McDonald’s-style apple pies – into the deep fryer. It was all very punk rock."", ""The setting was all enough to let you know you weren't meditating in the prayer room at Masa. Ko, which Chang opened in his old Noodle Bar space in 2008, was an unambiguous birdie flip to the expense account pomp of haute gastronomy.

So last November, Chang moved his flagship tasting spot to a 23-seat counter space just off The Bowery, a neighborhood that, in its present incarnation, is the precise opposite of punk rock; Ko’s neighbors are an art gallery and an apartment complex where studios start at $3,600/month.

229,"['What would the founding fathers have made of bacon cotton candy? That kind of question hovered like a smokehouse haze over the sumptuous dining room of McCrady’s circa 2006, when Sean Brock took over as the restaurant’s executive chef. He brought modernist gadgets and obsessions, his calling cards from that era of his career, to a building with over two centuries of history in Charleston. Edward McCrady completed the construction of his tavern in 1778; George Washington reportedly drank his fill of ale in its second-floor banquet room. The structure, with its entrance just steps down a cobblestone alley off of East Bay Street, fell into disuse over the years and languished until a restoration in the 1980s.', 'Before new owners took over McCrady’s in 2006 and hired Brock, who’d graduated from Johnson & Wales University in Charleston seven years earlier, the restaurant served amiable New American cuisine: pork chops with sweet potato puree and buttermilk onion rings, scallops with asparagus and hedgehog mushrooms, lemon poppy seed cake. Then Brock arrived and made some history of his own.', 'I remember my first meal there in 2007 as much for the people watching as for the food. Oh, the saucer eyes and fluttering brows among the Southern gentility when servers placed bowls of deconstructed she-crab soup on our linen-covered tables. We peered at a clump of crabmeat surrounded by gelatinized squares of roux and sherry. The server poured hot water over the ingredients and they alchemically converged into the familiar Lowcountry comfort. I can’t recall at that first meal if Brock spun cotton candy flavored with bacon or soy sauce or boiled peanuts, but they were all part of his repertoire then.', 'McCrady’s gave Brock the freedom of expression to become the food-world figure he is today.', 'The molecular wizardry subdued (though the hydrocolloids never completely disappeared) as Brock’s interests turned to farming and seed preservation and the New Nordic reverence for foraging and minimalism. McCrady’s gave Brock the freedom of expression to become the food-world figure he is today. When Brock’s Husk opened in 2010 and became an instant and enduring phenomenon, McCrady’s careened into a grand dame status — the mothership dedicated to Brock’s fine dining vision, the home base of glittery dinners for events like the Charleston Wine & Food Festival. It remains an admired restaurant, though it’s receded a bit from the national conversation.', 'Beef tartare with onion rings', 'So it gratified to return recently and find the kitchen producing shrewd dishes like pork crusted with four types of peppercorns (including Sichuan, for a flickering burn), overset with almonds made fluffy from grating and powdering them, and finished with crackly slivers of salsify jutting atop like sculpted serpents on a statue of Medusa. Lemon thyme leaves gave springtime zing to the earthbound flavors. The food still has an element of showmanship; the choreography now shows more restraint.', 'The food still has an element of showmanship; the choreography now shows more restraint.', 'Daniel Heinze is the restaurant’s current chef de cuisine, and he knows the Brock aesthetic exhaustively. He read about the transformation at McCrady’s last decade and moved in 2007 from his native Florida to Charleston. He’s been employed at the restaurant since, working his way up from line cook. For a couple of years, he traveled with Brock, cooking alongside him at scores of guest-chef dinners, and he took the reigns of McCrady’s kitchen last spring. The two communicate constantly but the menu ultimately belongs to Heinze.', 'At first he set meals as a four-course prix fixe but last month, in an effort to be more broadly appealing, the restaurant switched to a dual approach: An a la carte menu includes 14 or so dishes — some smaller and some larger, blurring the lines between appetizer and entrée — but now there’s also a $115 tasting menu comprised of three snacks and seven courses. I like the idea of ordering, say, a ham plate with red corn crackers and a salad of sweet potatoes and smoked trout in the bar area, ensconced at a two-top in an alcove lined with stained glass and an archway of ageless brick.', 'Peppercorn-crusted pork with powdered almonds and salsify; Mint powder-dusted angel food cake with sassafras ice cream and blueberry sorbet', 'I wanted the full measure of the kitchen’s abilities, though, so I went for the tasting menu. It delivered. Several dishes referenced popular trends but Heinze diverted them into fresh territory. House-made raw milk yogurt, blood orange vinaigrette, lime, and slivers of begonia leaves brought vitality to the tired beet salad genre. In a playful beef tartare, the pounce of anchovy and the crunch of croutons referenced Caesar salad; the dish came topped with pickled onion rings (sprinkled with chive and tarragon powder) for an additional wink at chophouse standards. And Heinze can certainly dream up his own masterstrokes. Wanting to work with lamb neck but finding the cut lackluster, he decided to cure the meat into a variation on pastrami. He paired it with red cabbage for the Eastern European nod and then dressed it with kumquat and marjoram for acid and herbal blasts.', 'McCrady’s doesn’t employ a pastry chef, but Heinze and his crew tackle desserts with unusual acumen. They had three, each better than the other: a strawberry granita flavored with pistachio and yuzu, a silky sliver of chocolate pudding glossed with banana caramel and covered with a rye crisp, and a gorgeous rectangle of angel food cake dusted with mint powder and flanked by sassafras ice cream (think root beer) and blueberry sorbet. It was mighty refreshing to find a savory chef approach sweets with some imagination and care, and one of many reminders that evening of why this timeless restaurant should stay very much on the Charleston radar.', 'Cost: A la carte dishes $10-$28; chef’s tasting menu (three snacks, seven courses), $115 per person.

230,"['For years one of my favorite restaurants in Chinatown was Full House. It occupied the ground floor of a new elevator building on the Bowery just north of Hester Street. The name seemed to be a winking reference to the underground card games operating in the immediate vicinity from which disappointed gamblers would emerge at all hours, hats pulled down over their eyes. There was a downstairs to the restaurant outfitted with flat-screen TVs, booths edged in blue neon, and a disco soundtrack aimed at the Chinese club kids who frequented the place. Upstairs was a loft intended for their parents, crowded with round tables draped with white tablecloths, and decorated with waving babies and winking dragons. The specialty of the house was Shanghai cuisine, and the soup dumplings — each surmounted by a tiny wad of crabmeat —were some of the best in town.', 'Then the restaurant underwent an abrupt identity change. Last autumn a new sign appeared that shouted Flaming Kitchen, a name that has engendered endless jokes among gay friends. The décor remained largely the same, but instead of music videos the screens now display news programming in Mandarin and, somewhat absurdly, American bowling tournaments. And instead of Shanghai, the menu concentrates on ""Szechuan Cuisine and Hot Pots."" Yet when you flip it open, much of the Shanghai food remains, along with Sichuan cold dishes and hot pots, all-day dim sum, and Cantonese and Chinese-American stir fries, plus a smattering of northern Chinese, Taiwanese, and plain American fare, like french fries and chicken wings, all washed down with fruit shakes and bubble tea. Will this strange mix become the standard Chinese menu of the future?', 'Will this strange mix become the standard Chinese menu of the future?', ""And how to approach such a complicated and confusing document?

In the section titled Cold Dishes, the ox tongue and tripe with chili sauce ($8.95) constitutes a sort of gateway drug to Sichuan cuisine, slicked with red oil and flecked with a modest quantity of peppercorns. The bumpy stomach tripe is mild enough that it might make an organ eater out of you. Better yet are the diced rabbit with peanuts (watch out for bones!) and the beef tendon — not the usual wobbly wads of connective tissue, but firmer flesh sliced thin for easy chewability."", 'Pickled vegetables and crispy tea smoked duck', 'All cold dishes don\'t prove to be spicy.

The hot pots among the Chef\'s Specials are your best chance to blow the top of your head off with the incendiary combo of chile oil, dried chiles, and Sichuan peppercorns. The cheapest, which easily feeds four as an entrée, if you order enough rice, is ""house special ma-la-tang"" ($18.95). From it you might dredge up nearly any protein found in Chinatown markets. Braised whole fish in spicy chili broth and pepper corn ($24.95) is far more predictable, featuring a whole sea bass.

Blindfolded, you might mistake it for Texas barbecue, though what part of the steer or sow would remain a mystery. You could really stay within the Chef\'s Special section for your entire meal, especially since it contains desirable standards from Shanghai (braised pork elbow), Taiwan (basil chicken), Xinjiang (grilled lamb chop with cumin), and Dongbei (pork with preserved cabbage).

Eat it with the country’s famous red rice ($1.99), nutty tasting and here mixed with basmati, or with tingmo ($1.50), a delightful steamed bread tied in a big knot like a weight lifter’s shoulder.

The bark, when distilled into a medicinal decoction, is purported to fight chronic dysentery, male infertility, gonorrhea, and flatulence. But most prized of all are the tree’s purple, oblong leaves. They harken the arrival of spring in China in the same way that ramps do for certain segments of the American population.

But the good news is that Fung Tu has since evolved into one of the city’s most compelling destinations for Chinese-American cooking, boasting cleaner flavors and spicier food than in its early days.

This is why Wu douses crispy chicken wings in a housemade yellow sauce that evokes the sinus-clearing sting of Chinese mustard packets (the ones that seem to invade everyone\'s office drawers post-delivery). He stuffs fatty pork belly into an egg roll but keeps the richness in check via something unexpected: the salty bitterness of olives. He takes a fluff-tacular bowl of brisket fried rice and finishes it with pomegranate seeds, adding a juicy, Sephardic counterpoint to the heady meat. And he pays homage to the classic softness of dan dan noodles with a German twist; he douses spaetzle in a bitter and fragrant Sichuan pork sauce. If the texture recalls Chef Boyardee a bit too much, just think of it as a spicy porridge and deal with it.', 'Sometimes, the Chinese associations are more freewheeling. Hence, a Mission Cantina-esque masa scallion pancake with smoked chicken (skip it), a fusion-y, five-spice seasoned Calabrian spreadable sausage (essentially a ""meat dip"" for shrimp chips), or excellent fried clam bellies dusted with tomato powder and black beans.

Such levels of pain are more appropriate for MCF, not for a venue like Fung Tu trying to do something more refined.', 'Wok-fried rice noodles, which practically scream with notes of toasted buckwheat, cool things down a bit. Wu adds kielbasa for extra oomph, making it all taste like a humble Eastern European take on Chinese fare. Wu justifies the pairing by talking about how Polish-Ukranian sausages are making their way into Northern China, but the better reasoning is that it just tastes good.

Traipse in the front door and the first thing you see isn’t a stage with a woman in sequins belting out a song and pounding the Casio, but a red banner with a picture of Vladimir Lenin looking his fiercest. Further inside, the effect is multiplied by hammer-and-sickle motifs and posters featuring communist slogans. Are the patrons committed Marxists, ready to grab a brick and leap onto the barricades at the slightest provocation? No, for the impassive customers, who sit around the long tables alternately drinking fruit compote and vodka, this is clearly an exercise in nostalgia, tongue planted firmly in cheek.', 'Once the place was called Russian Style Ravioli, and it specialized in pelmeni (dumplings shaped like bulging navels) and vareniki (half-moon pierogi) stuffed with such plebian ingredients as mushrooms, potatoes, veal, cottage cheese, cherries, and cabbage. At Stolovaya both types of dumplings are still featured on the menu, 25 to a platter heaped with caramelized onions, for the unbelievable price of $4.95. The cabbage vareniki were a particular favorite one evening, the shredded vegetable slightly sweet and well on the way to becoming sauerkraut. Indeed, lots of things are mildly fermented at Stolovaya, including an omnibus pickle platter wherein half the selections are fruits. If you’ve never tasted pickled watermelon or pickled purple grapes, don’t miss the chance.', 'Stolovaya is not a restaurant exactly, but something more like a military mess hall — what the French called a bouillon in the early 20th century. It caters mainly to working men who are either unmarried or intent on getting away from their wives with a tableful of comrades. The food is plain and copious and so low-priced that three friends and I recently ate a ginormous meal of 12 dishes along with flagons of French beer, and the tab came to $103. Did I mention that the bill included tax and tip?', 'Siberian pelmeni and an assortment of pickles', 'So, what’s good here besides pelmeni and vareniki? The herring app ($5.95) is a formidable-size fish, the lovely firm flesh cut into swatches and served with boiled potatoes. The french fries are some of the best in Brooklyn, made from cheap potatoes that stay soft and creamy inside with the skin partly intact, fried until they become as tan as Brighton Beach sunbathers at summer’s end. A big table-size serving is $4.95 (or $6.95 heaped with mushrooms), but since every dinner comes with a choice of fries, rice, or mashed potatoes, hold off ordering them until you’ve seen the entrees and decide you must have more.', 'Here are the best full-plate meals: Uzbek-style kebabs ($7.90 to $9.90) come two to a portion, featuring 10 hunks of chicken, pork, beef, lamb, or Chilean sea bass — which you should skip since the species in often unsustainably caught, or perhaps because its real name is Patagonian toothfish. The lamb ribs are gloriously fatty and fully absorb smoke from the charcoal over which they’ve been cooked. Chicken tabaka is a Georgian classic (referring to the former Soviet republic), a full bird flattened under a brick, cooked to a sienna shade, then paved with crushed garlic. You’ve never had better fried chicken, but sawing it with the dull knife provided may prove a challenge.', 'Above: Chicken tabaka; Below: smoked herring and stuffed cabbage rolls', 'Anything called ""cutlet"" is great, including ""country style pork cutlets"" ($6.95) and the more elitist pork chop ($9.95), which is really just a pair of cutlets glued together by some culinary legerdemain, then battered and fried. For the heartiest appetites, beef stroganoff comes in a hollowed-out loaf of bread, meat plus mushrooms in a gravy thickly laced with sour cream. If you exercise the french fry option as far as starch goes on this entree, dipping them in the gravy is among dining’s greatest delights. There are seafood entrees, too, including whole fish skillet-sauteed — at $10 to $15, quite a deal. Other entrees reflect the czarist obsession with French food, including a not-very-good version of chicken kiev, and a much better ""rabbit in white sauce,"" which sounds like something from Alice in Wonderland. In fact, the single best dish on the menu is French: holodets, a perfect bone-broth aspic dotted with morsels of chicken, making a sort of savory super-Jell-O.', 'At this point a caveat must be issued. Stolovaya (which means ""cafeteria"" or ""canteen"" in Russian) doesn’t give a damn about vegetables or your reverent attitude towards them. While the entrees with their attendant starches are voluminous, the vegetable component is invariably just shredded cabbage and a hillock of baby peas poured cold from a giant can.

236,"['Fifteen years ago the Fujianese swept into Chinatown and totally transformed the neighborhood. Old-guard Cantonese places disappeared in droves — especially the ducks-in-the window type of teahouse, an institution that had defined Chinatown for over a century. In its place appeared two new restaurant varieties, the first featuring hand-pulled noodles and dumplings, the second specializing in the regional cuisine of Fujian. Both types soon crowded East Broadway, with Eldridge Street another hotspot. While regional Fujianese menus often included a smattering of familiar Cantonese dishes, the balance was at once fascinating and partly inscrutable to outsiders, centered on tiny peanut dumplings in sweet soups, dishes tinted bright red with rice-wine lees, and seafood of such diversity that newbie diners were sent scurrying for their zoological reference works.', 'Well, the great Fujianese age may be gradually coming to a close, as evidenced by the reappearance of Cantonese teashops along East Broadway, most with a Hong Kong bent that re-prioritizes the old bill of fare. In the shadow of the Manhattan Bridge amidst queues of cheap Chinatown buses, the newest is King’s Kitchen. Yes, ducks are swinging again in its windows, along with steamed chickens, roast baby pigs, and giant yellow cuttlefish, which may alarm some customers. Watch your fingers! The interior is lined with gleaming tiles, white on top, black on the bottom. This waterproof wall treatment, which makes the place look a little like a medical laboratory, allows the proprietors to literally hose the place down at the end of the day — a spectacle worth witnessing.', 'Eel rice casseroled in a crock', 'This window display of Chinese charcuterie is served in the conventional style over a mountain of perfect white rice, priced from $4.75 (duck, soy sauce chicken, roast pork) to $7.95 (cuttlefish), or in combinations of two or three. The huge platters come sprinkled with sweet, soy-laced meat juices, but you should request the green scallion relish known as goeng jung; it doubles the pleasure of the preserved meats with its salty and gingery pungency. Go early in the day if you crave charcuterie, since it often runs out by early evening.', 'But there is also now a more Hong Kong-style alternative to these over-rice Cantonese barbecued meats called bo zai fan, designated on the menu as Rice Casseroles ($6.50 to $9.50). Cooked rice is shoveled into a porous clay crock that has been soaked in water, one or more ingredients are placed on top, and the lid firmly affixed. Then the whole thing is flung on a flaming brazier for 15 minutes or so, which sends steam swirling inside the crock and distributes the flavor of the added ingredients throughout the rice with great subtlety. Added ingredients can include frog, Japanese-style eel, and pork knuckle (these are highly recommended), in addition to quail, beef navel, salted chicken, and spare ribs with black bean sauce. The stickiest features swatches of braised beef and a runny egg.', 'Sure you can have them stuffed with beef navel or dried shrimp, but why not go wild and have the rice noodle wrapped around, say, a cruller and fish paste? ', 'Other big feeds at budget prices (this is Cheap Eats Week, after all!) include the rice porridge known as congee (try the stomach-soothing sliced-fish version), the usual assortment of wonton and noodle soups (which you should skip as being fundamentally boring), and a catalog of noodle stir-fries, the best being beef chow fun (get the kind with the gravy) and soy sauce fried noodle — a rudimentary vegetarian conglomeration that’s a Hong Kong favorite. Some of the best dishes at King’s Kitchen are the soul of simplicity.', 'Frog congee and soy sauce fried noodles', 'But keep in mind this sort of urbane, shopper-friendly institution, with its odd British flourishes, is also a perfect place for snacking. So why not pull up to a summery glass of milk-based bubble tea or a fruit smoothie in a tulip glass, as if you were in a 50s soda fountain, only in China, and grab a few short dishes? Towering above the rest are the super-wonderful Steamed Rice Rolls, which arrive looking like a pair of maki rolls using noodle material rather than seaweed. Sure you can have them stuffed with beef navel (chewy brisket), bitter melon, shrimp, or dried shrimp — the latter for extra crunch. But why not go wild and have the rice noodle wrapped around, say, a cruller and fish paste? Or around a row of Japanese pork-and-shrimp shumai? Both show the fertile imaginations of Hong Kong chefs.', 'Then there are Thai style fried wontons, chicken wings stewed in a crock that arrives bubbling like a volcano, and plain plates of steamed bok choy or iceberg lettuce.

Formed using two stiff rounds of fried plantain in lieu of bread, it arrives layered with fixin’s like roast pork, fried cheese, shredded beef, and ketchup. When Charrua debuted a few months later just down the block, it also focused on a sandwich — the Uruguayan chivito — and a sandwich battle soon commenced. Mounted on a shiny brioche bun, the chivito bulges with ham, egg, steak, bacon, olives, mozzarella, pickled peppers, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, and mayo, every bit as lush as a New Orleans muffaletta. This version, one of five at Charrua, is called la canadiense ($16 dinner, $13 lunch), which means ""the Canadian."" Maybe the idea is that only a lumberjack could finish it. The chivito comes with a giant heap of fries so good you may demolish them before you pick up the sandwich.', 'The chivito bulges with ham, egg, steak, bacon, olives, mozzarella, pickled peppers, lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, and mayo.', 'The chivito', 'While Patacon Pisao feels like a fast food spot, Charrua is a full-blown bistro with big picture windows facing the Essex Market; banquettes on two sides are scattered with colorful throw pillows, and the walls are decorated with antique potato mashers and photographs of Old Montevideo — a city that’s like a smaller and wealthier version of Buenos Aires. Apart from the chivito and a chickpea flatbread called faina, there’s not much difference between Uruguayan and Argentinean food.', 'Though the Uruguayan national menu is rather limited, mainly confined to steaks, pizzas, pastas, and empanadas as a result of the Spanish and Italian heritage of its citizens, this limitation perfectly suits the purposes of a Lower East Side bistro. Most of the fare will seem instantly familiar, and there appear to be no frivolous inventions among the selections. Be prepared to sit down and have a delicious and relatively inexpensive winter meal, with no challenging organ meats, squishy sea urchins, or spicy sauces.', 'Fried to perfection, served in pairs, and poked with a toothpick that hoists green cocktail olives like a battle flag, the empanadas ($8) at Charrua are among the best in town. Your choices run to tuna, ground beef and egg, and best of all, corn kernels shot with pimento, making the filling sweet and salty and tasting like a summer day. As with nearly everything else on the menu, the empanadas come with a salad dressed a little too heavily with vinaigrette. Ask for no dressing, and use instead some of the excellent olive oil that comes with the table bread, rife with such tart, house-pickled vegetables as mushrooms, carrots, and onions that delicately flavor the oil.', 'Above: Empanadas, Below: Chipirones a la plancha and the dining room', 'The croquettes — either mushroom or ham and cheese, accompanied by a Russian-dressing dip — are good, though not of the empanada’s caliber. The appetizer portion of the menu also offers a three-cheese fondue, meatballs in tomato sauce, and a daily soup, but go instead for chipirones a la plancha ($12), small squid in a dark and salty braise. Also worthwhile is the split and grilled chorizo, which might remind you of smoked Polish sausage. If it’s lunchtime, you can have the chorizo as a choripan — the national sandwich of Argentina furnished with fries and dressed with chimichurri. Never has one block of the city seen so many South American sandwiches.', 'Tagged with little bits of skin and the glinting like polished bronze, the same fries also accompany the churrasco ($23), a skirt steak long enough that it doesn’t quite fit on the dinner plate. The kitchen will grill it any way you want, but the meat is good enough you might want it rare. It arrives sliced with the usual salad of baby lettuces. On the same sort of platter but at a considerably cheaper price, the milanesa ($16) is also terrific, a lightly breaded beef or chicken schnitzel of considerable size. Striving to fulfill its pro-forma bistro duties, Charrua dabbles in big salads. The one featuring beets and blue cheese you’ve seen dozens of times before; suffice to say the most interesting thing on the plate are the swatches of poached and lightly pickled white onion.', 'A couple of pastas are also available. Best is the superlative spaghetti a la Caruso ($14), a dish invented in the 1950s in a Montevideo restaurant to commemorate visits to the city by tenor Enrico Caruso 40 years earlier. Don’t ask why it took them so long. The al dente strands are tossed with mushrooms and ham, mellowed by cream, and sharpened with onions, and the pasta manages to seem more South American than Italian. The ample raviolis ($17) come with a choice of fillings (spinach or cheese) and sauces (tomato or pesto), but somehow the plate doesn’t quite amount to a full dinner. But an order of empanadas followed by those same raviolis might just do the trick.', 'Cost: A chivito-and-fries lunch with a beverage and tax, but not tip, will run around $20; dinner including an app plus pasta or meat course with a beverage and tax will be $30 to $35.', 'What to drink: The restaurant is B.Y.O.B., and beer or wine is the beverage of choice.

Same goes for the Korean pork ribs, which are smoked and fried, and which don’t exhibit the wimpy, fall-off-the-bone tenderness as Hometown’s mediocre spare ribs; instead, they boast a firmer, meatier chomp. The musk of the Heritage swine is powerful, but tempered by a salty-sweet sugar glaze.

Try getting to Staten Island that fast."", ""Thing is, the hip kids have never really flocked to Jersey City with the same gusto that's propelled them toward Williamsburg, Bushwick, Greenpoint, or other too-cool-for-school neighborhoods.

In the early days, Kevin, the chef, sent out maple syrup-spiked pastrami (better than Katz\'s), grilled cod collar (nicely fatty), and best of all, raw hamachi with trout roe and jalapeno — a dish imbued with so much oil and heat it tasted like what would happen if a Michelin-starred chef took over Guy Fieri’s test kitchen. The menu, of course, was always a la carte; a meal for two — two appetizers, a shared pasta, two larger plates and dessert — would run about $125 after tax and tip (but before wine).', ""Then Thirty Acres switched to a tasting menu-only way of life in February. Cost: $75 for ten courses, which means a Friday night date would run no less than $190. Add on full wine pairings at $55 each and you're at $330. That’s a heck of a hike, though you quickly forget about prices when the grilled poussin with spicy lobster sauce arrives. The combination is so startling that David Chang could serve it at Momofuku Ko and watch a flurry of think pieces roll in on the blogosphere.

As such, dinner at Thirty Acres might begin a series of bites: a salty squid ink rice ball, a demitasse of sea bean and kohlrabi soup, and a grilled duck heart coated in such a drippy coat of blood orange that appears as if it were freshly ripped out of a live bird, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom-style.

The modern set menu venue is populated by cooks whose names you might not recognize; they didn't rise to chef de cuisine at Per Se or Cafe Boulud before striking out on their own.

The first time I tried it, the creation was unambiguously delicious and straightforward enough to serve at a football party. Then on visit number two, I noticed the exterior had a gentle citrus tang and a subtle jerky-like chew, with buckwheat groats evoking the earthy kasha dinners I enjoyed as a 20-year-old living in Russia. And during my final meal, I detected yet another layer of flavor, this one the flatulent funk of cabbage, like a dry-aged piece of beef disguised as a vegetable (the chef tells me he brushes the leaves with duck fat, which hikes the up the flavor to NC-17 levels).

Take the shallot tart, a mess of sweet roots atop a pastry crust, with a hint of black truffle, a dab of mornay, and an almost invisible slice of lardo. The result is a shockingly delicious, solid-state French onion soup. Or consider the koji-marinated beet tartare, where little dots of foie gras aioli are interspersed throughout, acting as carnivorous capers to these vegetables posing as beef, and adding a whisper of lusciousness to these low-fat environs.', 'All the action takes place at an 18-seat, U-shaped, ash-wood counter, in a room little bigger than a studio apartment. Think of it this way: Semilla is what Brooklyn Fare would look like if it were folded upon itself like a piece of origami. The space feels taller than it is wide, which perhaps explains all the vertically stored dry goods; you might see chef fetch them by standing atop their workspace like culinary trapeze artists.', 'The chef prefers to find his luxury in more ephemeral and pedestrian indulgences', 'Lucky diners, sitting adjacent the kitchen pass, can watch as Ramirez-Ruiz shaves black truffles over a bowl of scrambled eggs and Carolina rice — the lone supplement on the menu ($35) and sadly one that won’t be available now that the season is over.

The delicate leaves are so packed with sugar it almost tastes as if you’re eating a cotton candy salad finished with melted peanut brittle (but with balance).

243,"['\n  What defines a ""modern"" IPA? \n  ', 'As a drinking parent with a toddler problem, I carefully monitor my alcohol intake. Sensible imbibing is a fine precept for everyone, but it’s especially true for folks who make their bucks from booze. Back in my twenties, when the thought of fathering a child was as foreign as affordable health insurance, it was perfectly acceptable to bar-hop away my nights and days, smashed and stumbling, salty and slit-eyed. As long as I woke up and clacked out stories, I could put the ""fun"" in functional drunk.', 'My twenties were a judgment-free decade. My thirties welcomed new responses to wanton debauchery. Instead of high-fives, Monday morning hangovers were met with eyebrows arched high. Falling down and slurring words was bad form, the sign of an amateur, not a professional. Moderation became my middle name.', ' The importance of restraint was underscored one day in November 2013 when, at midnight’s stroke, my daughter, Violet, squirmed into the world. To celebrate I sipped Sierra Nevada’s citrusy, piney and decently potent Celebration Ale, chased by multiple rounds. Drinking was easy. The hard part was changing a diaper after sipping the better part of a six-pack.  The messy fumbling was my first introduction to this unwavering formula: strong beers + parenting = disaster. I didn’t want to be a cliché, dropping double IPAs and then my daughter. The opposite extreme, teetotaling, was totally unappealing. After all, drinking was key to properly doing my job. As a solution, I developed a boozy system of checks and balances. After Violet went to bed, I could sample heavy-hitting imperial stouts, double IPAs and other eyesight-blurrers. During the daylight hours—and while on dad duty—I’d sip the likes of lower-strength lagers, witbiers and session IPAs.', 'Like most every craft beer consumer, I love a good IPA, the bitter symbol of modern American brewing. Socked with aromas of lemons and oranges, mangoes and papayas, medical-grade marijuana and pine trees, IPAs are delivery vehicles for full-throttle aroma and flavor. Also: alcohol. Many IPAs top 6, 7 or 8 percent ABV, meaning two or three pints would make me a baby-dropping butter fingers.', 'Happily, the last few years have seen brewers give IPAs an alcoholic haircut, dropping the ABV while keeping flavor and aroma cranked high. Session IPAs—as in, you can sip several in a drinking session—have become a screaming phenomenon. Ever since Founders debuted its massively successful All Day IPA in 2010 (it went year-round in 2012), breweries have rushed to roll out lower-alcohol IPAs. Lagunitas DayTime. Left Hand Introvert. Stone Go To. Drake’s Alpha Session. Flying Dog Easy IPA. The list stretches into hop-scented infinity.', 'Happily, the last few years have seen brewers give IPAs an alcoholic haircut, dropping the ABV while keeping flavor and aroma cranked high.', 'Before session IPAs became all the craze, there was 21st Amendment’s Bitter American. The San Francisco brewery was born in 2000, when writer Nico Freccia and paralegal-turned-brewer Shaun O’Sullivan opened a brewpub right by the Giants\' new baseball stadium. The proximity to 81 annual home games helped the brewpub survive in the lean early years—thanks, dotcom crash!—and it’s since grown into one of the country’s 50 biggest craft breweries.  The company’s canned beer line-up (all featuring quirky, graphic-intensive artwork) includes the summery Hell or High Watermelon wheat beer; spiced Fireside Chat strong ale; roasty and lightly resinous Back in Black IPA; and until recently, Bitter American. First released in early 2007 at the brewpub, the golden ""extra pale ale"" was an easy-sipping tango of nuts and biscuits, grapefruit and pine, lemons and flowers. At 4.4 percent ABV, Bitter American was a beer that you could polish off by the six-pack.  I did. Repeatedly. Until this spring, when news came down the pipeline that 21st Amendment was killing the brand. From a marketing standpoint, I understood the move. Bitter American was never branded a session IPA. Those three letters are sales gold. Moreover, the word ""bitter"" is a bit misleading, as the beer was never all that bitter. Despite its popularity, the beer was dispatched to the dustbin, replaced by Down to Earth.  Though branded a session IPA, Down to Earth is not all that different from Bitter American. The ABV (4.4 percent) and bitterness (42 IBUs) are identical, and like its predecessor, DtE is made with plenty of Golden Promise malt, which supplies that nutty, toasty note. The huge difference is the hops. The session IPA is lavishly flavored with voguish Mosaic, a cultivar that calls to mind berries and tropical fruit. The beer drinks crisp and clean, the bitterness a moderate peck on your palate.   It’s a session IPA tuned to modern tastes, a cooler-ready crowd-pleaser that’ll keep the party going all day and night, whether you’re picnicking, at the beach or taking care of a tiny, precious human.']"
244,"[""Say you were propelling your bird-prowed totora raft in a light breeze across Lake Titicaca, ringed with mountain peaks and said to be the birthplace of the sun. Separating Bolivia from Peru at a whopping 12,507 feet above sea level, it's the highest navigable lake in the world. Feeling a bit peckish, you row your vessel over to a thatched concession stand on the side of the lake to buy a hero sandwich. What would it be like?"", 'The answer lies at Cumbre, one of only three Bolivian restaurants in the city. Located on Queens’ Woodside Avenue where it wends its way across the chasm of the BQE between Woodside and Elmhurst, the restaurant is intimate and boxy, with charming paintings of indigenistas and Andean villagescapes. The women in the pictures, of course, wear colorful woven shawls and those bowler hats that make them look like London gentlemen circa 1850.', 'The interior of Cumbre', 'The sandwich in question — available at Cumbre for $8 — is the tranca pecho (""chest clogger""). Eliciting oohs and aahs from fellow diners as it sails in on its demi-baguette, the sandwich comes diversely stuffed with a breaded beef cutlet, fried egg, chopped purple onions, ripe tomatoes, and diced beets that leave little rivulets of violent color on the stark-white egg. But the strangest ingredient of all is a layer of moist white rice that blankets the cut surface of the bread like a sort of granular mayonnaise, also ramping up the carb component — a real asset when you\'re toiling uphill all day.', 'Maybe it\'s the thin mountain air, but much of Bolivian cuisine presents similar unexpected (and often delightful) collisions of ingredients. Another case in point is pique macho ($15), a massive platter of beef swatches and hot dogs, constituting one of the world\'s craziest culinary pairings. Also featuring onions and tomatoes, the dish looks like a stir-fry, and indeed it was probably inspired by the Chinese cuisine that appeared in Bolivia a century ago. On top of the pique macho — which means something like ""manhood challenge,"" a reference to the size of the platter — is a heap of cheese cubes. Stir them in immediately so they melt and glue the whole thing together.', 'Above: A saltena; Below: escabeche mixto and a tranca pecho', 'Hands-down the best thing on the menu are Bolivia’s delightful empanadas, called saltenas ($2.50). The domed pies stuffed with beef or chicken also contain chopped eggs, raisins, olives, and peas. The pastry is fantastically obdurate, with a precisely braided spine. Why is the crust so hard? Tap into one and out squirts gravy. Indeed, these pies are as technically marvelous as Shanghai soup dumplings — they might be called Andean soup pies. Other dishes showing the influence of the Conquistadores include an escabeche mixto of pickled head cheese, pig foot, and vegetables that tastes good in a vinegary sort of way but requires lots of gnawing; it may not be your cup of tea.', 'In fact, one of the advantages of Cumbre for a certain type of adventuresome diner is the unreconstructed nature of the food, which hasn’t been gussied up to appeal to a broad spectrum of Americans. Organs, for example, abound. There’s a beef tripe soup using the type known as ""book tripe,"" which might be mistaken for white polyethylene plastic, and a kidney soup laced with cumin, for pee lovers only. Much better is an entrée of cow tongue in big tender sheets blanketed with an agreeable sauce made from fresh tomatoes. This is one of only two sauces you’ll be seeing at the restaurant, both of which have an improvised quality as if concocted on the spot and not worked over the way French sauces are.', 'Another use of tomato sauce is falso conejo ($7 large, $13 humongous), featuring the same breaded beef cutlet you saw in the hero sandwich. The name means ""fake rabbit,"" and the dish must have been invented just after the last bunny was shot in Bolivia, when some resourceful cook decided that a substitution smothered in sauce might go undetected. (Or you could make up your own story.)', 'The other improvised sauce, a bit grainy and exceedingly mild in flavor, is made with peanuts. It appears on a couple of Peruvian dishes that swam across the lake, including the beef-heart shish kebabs called anticuchos, and in the in the famous mountain concoction of boiled potatoes, papas ala Huancaina, here replacing the usual cheese sauce. Potatoes and peanuts also recur in a soup with a creamy base that floats french fries like boats on a lake. Should the fact that the fries are of the crinkle-cut frozen variety deter you from trying sopa de mani? Maybe not. This juxtaposition is only one of many startling and unpredictable features of the food at Cumbre.', 'Cost: Dinner for two with beers and tax but not tip, $40.', 'Sample dishes: Saltenas (empanadas), pique macho (beef-frankfurter stir fry), tranca pecho (hero sandwich), aji de lengua (braised tongue), brazuelo (fried lamb shank).', 'What to drink: Two Bolivian beers are available, Pacena (light lager) and El Inca (malty dark beer with a low alcohol content), along with fruit milkshakes and mate de coca, tea made from pulverized coca leaves. Don’t miss it if you’re feeling logy.', 'Bonus tip: Don’t miss the saltenas, and consider splitting a soup and one of the entrees between two diners and you’ll have plenty of food.', 'Cost: Dinner for two with beers and tax but not tip, $40.', 'Sample dishes: Saltenas (empanadas), pique macho (beef-frankfurter stir fry), tranca pecho (hero sandwich), aji de lengua (braised tongue), brazuelo (fried lamb shank).', 'What to drink: Two Bolivian beers are available, Pacena (light lager) and El Inca (malty dark beer with a low alcohol content), along with fruit milkshakes and mate de coca, tea made from pulverized coca leaves.

245,"['As with food, to professionally write about beer is to engage in an eternal tug-of-war with austerity and overindulgence.

The tough part is staying sober and ensuring that my belly doesn’t balloon to proportions worthy of Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.', 'To fight the battle of the bulge and the enduring, erroneous cliché of slovenly beer drinkers, I could run, or maybe make friends with an elliptical machine. Alack, my knobby knees are not suited to pounding pavement, and a gym membership is a cost that’d crimp my budget for more crucial expenditures, like diapers or another double IPA.  My favored calorie-cutter is the bicycle. Three or four days a week, I’ll pedal loops around Brooklyn’s nearby Prospect Park, or maybe breezily ride to heavily Russian Brighton Beach, home to pelmeni dumplings and Baltika beer.

Spotting trends becomes stories that become my rent. And this summer is officially the Season of the Radler. The accessible style is a perfect trend-piece storm. It’s low in alcohol, making it lockstep with the session movement; suited for warm-weather sipping, be it pools or beer gardens; and freighted with flavors of citrus, a taste profile du jour.', 'Photo courtesy of Hopworks Urban Brewery.', 'But it’s the biking angle that most interests me. Radler is German for bicyclist, referencing lore about a Bavarian innkeeper near a bike path. One day in 1922, he was so besieged by parched bicyclists that he extended his dwindling beer supply by combining lager and lemon soda. The mix was a mega-hit, with the beer cocktail in time entering the drinking canon.', 'From Boulevard Ginger-Lemon Radler to Narragansett Del’s Shandy and Widmer Brothers Hefe Shandy, the style is everywhere, from bars to beer gardens and beaches. As for a bike path–appropriate beer, I’ll pedal to Portland’s Hopworks Urban Brewery, or HUB. The organic-focused brewery was founded by Christian Ettinger, himself an avid bicyclist. His two-wheeled passion informs the brewery’s dual locations, where bike frames dangle above the bar, cyclists can borrow tools and Hopworks hosts the annual Handmade Bike & Beer Festival. (Did I mention that HUB also has a keg-toting, sound system–equipped cargo bike?)', 'Unlike some radlers and shandies, which taste as if they had a one-night stand in an artificial-flavor factory, Totally Radler’s lemony characteristics shine bright, tart and true.', 'Underling the cycling commitment, many of the brewery’s canned beers, including HUB Lager and Hopworks IPA, are emblazoned with bike chains. At the brewery, a favorite draft-only offering has long been Totally Radler, made by blending organic lemonade with lager. This month, Hopworks put the mixture into a portable package, releasing Totally Radler cans featuring a fully awesome design. (Pro tip to brewers: excellent artwork is increasingly key.) On the 16-ounce vessel, there’s an anthropomorphic lemon and hop, waving gaily, riding a bicycle with citrus wedges for wheels. While flashy packaging may attract customers, the liquid inside matters most.']"
246,"['Anthony Bourdain, perhaps the world\'s most recognizable gastronome after the Michelin Man, said the following about Hawaii on a recent episode of CNN\'s Parts Unknown: ""It\'s not a particularly welcoming or friendly part of the world, contrary to the aloha myth."" Geographically speaking, there\'s a lot of truth to that statement. Hawaii, located in the middle of nowhere in the North Pacific, is 2,500 miles from the U.S. mainland. It\'s so far South it makes Alabama feel like a Yankee state. Its official motto is Ua Mau ke Ea o ka Aina i ka Pono, which I like to roughly translate as ""Amazon Prime shipping costs more here."" And it\'s an indisputable fact that there are more daily nonstop flights from JFK to China than there are to Honolulu; a Brooklynite could even fly to Moscow more quickly. The state is, by its very nature, inaccessible, which perhaps explains why only a handful of New York establishments commit themselves to Hawaiian cuisine.', ""It's therefore a boon to Big Apple diners that three young restaurateurs – chef Chung Chow, Gerald San Jose, and Jin Ahn – have opened the 56-seat Noreetuh in Manhattan's East Village, a promising work-in-progress that seeks to interpret the Global East (and beyond) through a distinctly American lens. If Hawaii's melting pot cuisine has historically fused itself along the lines of its Polynesian, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Chinese residents, many of whom immigrated to the archipelago long before Uncle Sam annexed it at the turn of the 20th century, Noreetuh takes things even further, mixing in influences from France, New York, and elsewhere."", ""Things stay fairly traditional with the poke, a seafood salad that typically comprises raw fish, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chiles. Noreetuh's version is a grade-A classic, mixing in bigeye tuna and Chinese spicy miso along with tosaka and oga seaweeds, plants whose gelatinous chew mimics the snap of beef tendon."", '[Top photo: tuna poke. Bottom photos, left to right: monkfish liver torchon and beef pineapple braised pork belly.]', 'But since Noreetuh is in Manhattan, and since fine dining acolytes are at the helm here, diners can expect adaptations and refinements. Take the musubi, a Hawaiian ""national"" snack that involves wrapping up sushi rice with nori and Spam, that famous luncheon meat whose consumption by World War II GI\'s would eventually help it become a staple of Pacific cuisine. Noreetuh takes the smart step of omitting that industrial pork product and replacing it with something one might find at Katz\'s a few blocks away: corned beef tongue. The meat is supremely flavorful by itself, but Chung tosses on a layer of chimichurri-like cilantro puree to brighten up the affair.', ""You consume these delicacies in a small, shouty room, while sitting on metal chairs or backless bar stools, and while listening to a soundtrack that ranges from mainstream (Lady Gaga, Hawaii's own Bruno Mars) to retro (lesser-known Notorious B.I.G. tracks). No cocktails at Noreetuh, just a smart list of beer, sake, wines, and something quite rare for an affordable, a la carte restaurant: beverage pairings. For $35 or more, Ahn, the general manager, will match your meal with three pours or thereabouts. Such a policy, at such a low price, should encourage more oenophilic novices to think of ordering wine as a conversation with a beverage director, rather than a random walk down an unfamiliar list."", ""Prices are low all around, with mains topping out at $25; a stellar monkfish liver torchon is just $13. Chung divorces himself even further from his native Hawaii with that oceanic charcuterie. The flavor is vaguely saline, while the texture is closer to an airy ile flottante than the foie gras it aspires to be. A dollop of passionfruit gelee and slices of Portuguese-style sweet bread nominally evoke the islands, but the sensibilities of this dish are more like a French chef's dream of the Pacific. It all recalls the kind of creative elegance one might've encountered in the early aughts back at Thomas Keller's Per Se, a fine dining establishment that once employed all three of Noreetuh's principals. And here it's worth noting that while Per Se's alumni populate a wonderfully heterogeneous group restaurants throughout the city (and the world), they've been particularly active on the Asian front in NYC, giving birth to such capable institutions as Uncle Boons, Mu Ramen, and Fung Tu."", '[Chef Chung Chow]', ""Noreetuh, at about three months old, is an esteemed member of that group, albeit one whose kitchen is still finding its sea legs. Take the pork croquettes, which aim to be the Asian equivalent of salt cod fritters, a poor man's preparation wherein humble potatoes are used to extend more expensive bits of swine. Too bad there's little pork flavor – the meat itself, which you dip into a very run-of-the-mill barbecue sauce, is bland. The spicy gobi, a preparation that's about as incendiary and complex as a bowl of breakfast cereal, is a skip too. Kimchi-spiked octopus poke could pass for a mayonnaise-heavy seafood salad at any fine gourmet market. And white asparagus, with bits of Chinese ham, doesn't rise above the level of refinement one might encounter at Whole Foods."", '1. Remember that even though the menu is a la carte, wine pairings are available starting at $35 for about three pours.', ""2. Champagne, which often starts at $25 and over at fancier venues, is just $16 by the glass at Noreetuh (Charles Ellner, Epernay). It's what you drink with the (over-battered) mushroom tempura, or the tofu with uni and trout roe."", '3. Expect a solid variety of lean whites to pair with the delicately sweet, spicy fare. For something on the smoky side, consider the Francois Villard vignonier ($14). For a more floral wine with a hint of residual sugar, the Gunderloch kabinett riesling should get the job done; pair the latter with the jalapeno-spiked chow noodles.', ""4. Though the wine list leans French, the beer selection allows for a taste of Asia and the Pacific. South Korea's Hite lager is easygoing enough to pair with much of the menu, as is the Big Wave Golden Ale from Kona, Hawaii. Both are $6."", '5. For those who choose to bring their own wines, corkage is affordable, at $15 for every 750ml bottle.', ""Certain dishes could do with a bit of editing here and there. Does a cut of Wagyu sirloin, packing a hefty chew and a clean, concentrated beefiness, really need an assortment of cold, mealy, cherry tomatoes? Do toothsome chow noodles, paired with heady morels, and pickled jalapeños, really need a week's worth of asparagus and pea tendrils in the same bowl? And given the four-course style of the a la carte menu, do portions really need to be as big as they are? Snacks are often sized like appetizers, while appetizers could often pass themselves off as mains. Mains are enough to feed two or more, and desserts can easily nourish three."", 'So order wisely. Try the pineapple-braised pork belly with sweet potatoes, an essay in restrained sugars and expertly rendered fats. Or go old school with the garlic shrimp, bursting with intoxicating allium and crustacean aromas.', ""Pro Tip: take a pass on the ho-hum sweets, from the bread pudding, indistinguishable from any other average version, to the bruleed pineapple, where caramelized sugar, lime zest and sea salt somehow fail to make the creation taste noticeably different from a cheaper, supermarket fruit.

David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar did this in 2006 with a concise menu of hams, offal, sandwiches, and small plates, but Mission Chinese, by contrast, wants to be a millennial\'s everything-but-the-kitchen sink extravaganza, with a bit of high-end prix fixe dining thrown in for good measure. The bill of fare reads like a Google Trend search of stereotypical New York dining: kale with ""healthy grains"" and bone marrow, wood-fired pizza, vegan ramen, fried chicken (packed with an intense poultry flavor), raw shellfish, large-format steaks, large-format uni (wut?), and tasting menus.

Among the many dining options, friends from the area suggested rustic Finca and the much tonier Corazón de Tierra (the two sit about seven miles apart) for examples of two gifted but very different chefs reveling in the region\'s abundance. Finca is the Valle outpost from Javier Plascencia, Baja California\'s cross-cultural ambassador. A native of Tijuana born into a family of restaurateurs, Plascencia runs Mision 19, opened in 2011 and heralded as the upscale trailblazer that catalyzed the city\'s current dining renaissance.

The flavors are recognizably Mexican but stripped down. Plascencia favors cooking lamb and suckling pig slowly in a caja china, or roasting box. Each arrived as a mix of roughly chopped meat with bones for gnawing, strewn with a few strands of pickled onions and a roasted scallion. Glassy fragments of pig skin crackled against the teeth like porcine rock candy."", 'Smoky dishes also seemed right with the scenery.

A sea-blue pan held a shell filled with Pismo clam that had been smoked in an oak barrel and accented with fennel, Serrano chile, herb butter, and a sprinkling of queso fresco. Alongside we ordered tacos made from hot, freckled whole-wheat tortillas that we stuffed with rendered nuggets of beef cheek and dressed with chunky salsas.', ""A few menu items weaved in global flavors. Grilled octopus came doused in a marinade of soy sauce, citrus, ginger, and peanuts, a nod to the influences of the Chinese and Japanese immigrants that arrived in the area nearly a century ago. Plascencia like to evoke Baja's topographical similarities to the Mediterranean with starters like beef tongue tonnato, served with the creamy tuna sauce that's a classic in Italy atop shaved veal. And note the Caesar salad among the appetizers: A few years ago Plascencia's family took ownership of the Tijuana restaurant where the leafy ubiquity purportedly originated."", ""If Plascencia is the face of emergent Valle cooking, then Diego Hernández-Baquedano, a native of Ensenada, could be considered the hands. Certainly, no Sysco truck is delivering supplies to the back door of his Corazón de Tierra. The restaurant is part of La Villa del Valle, a 70-acre property with six guest rooms and a winery. Owners Eileen and Phil Gregory, Hernández-Baquedano, and their employees maintain vegetable patches, tend beehives for honey, press oil from onsite olive trees, raise chickens for eggs (among other animals), and gather fruits from their citrus orchard.

Dishes came rapid-fire after the uni and spot prawn rhapsody: a mix of lobster and snow crab baked in a lobster shell under a stratum of mayo and eel sauce; a tempura course with shrimp, baby okra, shiitakes, and Japanese rockfish; and a nigiri assortment of yellowtail, salmon belly, halibut, silvery-skinned kohada (Japanse shad), and another piece of the lyrical uni. None of it caused shivers of revelations, but it was all ably prepared and satisfying."", 'Above:\xa0Live spot-prawn and uni and cod milt; Below: Sushi Ota interior', 'The next delicacy proved more provocative. It was sacs of baked cod semen, typically available only in winter. It looked like alabaster brains but possessed a decidedly singular creaminess.

Yuzu\'s sunny flavor brightened the dish, though honestly it was potent enough that a few bites sufficed. A cup of miso soup with clams made for a tame denouement to the meal. A server then came up and asked me what flavor of ice cream I wanted for dessert: green tea, plum, or red bean. I chose plum, but I could have ended with the clams, or maybe had a couple of more lobes of uni before relinquishing my bar seat to the next anxious patron.', ""Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

It arrives in a pair of small mason jars, curried fish tidbits in a fluffy, brick-red mousse of coconut milk and duck eggs, with a nest of shredded kaffir lime leaves on top. Damn, it’s good! Find ho mok among a wealth of other unusual fare at Kiin Thai, a new offshoot of Somtum Der in the midst of the N.Y.U. campus — how’s that for hiding in plain sight? The space was formerly the lackluster Cafetasia, a pan-Asian refectory that one always suspected of secretly being a dormitory dining hall. Well, even cursed locations can get lucky sometimes.', 'Kiin Thai interior', '""Airy"" is a word that might be abused for the umpteenth time to describe the interior, which offers a finger of space with window seating to the left of the front door, while on the right a whitewashed dining room spreads before you, seating about 60 at bone-white tables. The room reminded one friend of ABC Carpet, featuring little clusters of kitschy paintings, random ceramics, and objets d’art hung on the wall and in distressed-wood cabinets. The room is pleasant enough, though you’d never guess Kiin Thai is one of the best Southeast Asian restaurants in the city.', 'You’d never guess Kiin Thai is one of the best Southeast Asian restaurants in the city.', 'Compared to the monomaniacal menu of Somtum Der — which concentrates almost to the point of insanity on the green papaya salads, yums, and bar snacks of Thailand’s Isan region — Kiin Thai’s is eclectic. It creeps across the map to include Central Thai recipes as well as noodles from Chiang Mai, a city on Thailand’s border with Burma. An example of the latter is khao soi ($15), a meal-size soup in a rich yellow broth stippled with red chile oil, which also shows Burmese influences. Soft egg noodles lurk in the depths while crunchy fried noodles float on top — as if the cook couldn’t decide which type to use. Khao soi might just be the Siamese dish of the year, since it’s also showcased at Pok Pok and (unsurprisingly) at Kao Soy, both in Red Hook.', 'Like Pok Pok, which it more than a little resembles in outlook, Kiin Thai fearlessly features dishes from other Southeast Asian countries, especially when they fill in perceived gaps in the Thai menu. Grilled summer shrimp ($10) constitutes a cunning variation on Vietnamese summer rolls. Colorfully served in a series of four shot glasses, each roll features pickled carrots, cucumbers, and good-size shrimp tumbled inside an oak-lettuce leaf, which is further wrapped in sticky rice paper. A dose of fermented fish sauce finishes the accompanying tamarind dip, which is so good you’ll grab it back from the busboy as he tries to remove it from the table.', 'Above: Nham prik ong; Below: Ho mok steamed striped bass and grilled summer shrimp wraps', 'Who doesn’t love a restaurant that takes chances? Though you might never order it again, the plate-size salad called tum sweet corn with salted eggs ($10) is a tour-de-force of Southeast Asian flavors, with the funky and crumbly eggs lolling in a field of bright yellow kernels that taste powerfully of lime and chiles. Thankfully, Kiin is one place you won’t be asked to select a level of hotness — the dishes come just the way they are and you’ll have to deal with it. Other menu oddities include duck in an oily red curry; the obscene-sounding golden bags (vegetables fried in rice paper); and chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves. Also known as screw pine, these leaves issue from a deciduous tree with a flavor approximating basmati rice; they’re also used in India to goose up the flavor of inferior rice. Gobble the bird and discard the leaves, which are too tough to be edible.', 'Wonders await around every corner at Kiin Thai. The much-abused pad Thai is here rehabilitated by concealing the noodles inside a thin omelet and putting the shrimp on top. If you want to make it too sweet — as they do in bad Thai restaurants — a small vessel of sugar comes on the side along with crushed peanuts and pickled turnips. My favorite dish on the menu is relished both in Isan and across the muddy Mekong River in Laos. Nham prik ($12) is a bowl of fiery ground pork that comes with an array of dipping implements that surround the bowl like a passel of squalling children around a matriarch. This convivial concoction can be shared by the whole table, who take turns scooping up the ground meat with fried pork skins, carrots, cucumbers, cabbage, sausages, and fish cake. Consider it a test of your dexterity likely to leave your fellow diners in stitches as you try to ferry the dip to your mouth without dribbling meat on your pants.

254,"[""Good restaurants often have distinctive themes, be it the old world clubbiness of Minetta Tavern, or the worn down pub feel of The Breslin, but you wouldn’t call them theme restaurants, which is what happens when an over-the-top environment never really fades into the background like it should. (Please see the hokey warriors of Ninja and the bacchanalian Buddhas of Tao.) Theme restaurants, typically, are not very good places to eat.

""We’re a storytelling company,"" chef Mario Carbone told me last year. Major Food Group, which he runs with Jeff Zalaznick and Rich Torrisi, has developed a reputation for its immersive (and expensive) restaurants with carefully-curated playlists. Mario’s namesake Carbone in Greenwich Village is a throwback Italian-American joint with red tuxedoed waiters and Goodfellas-inspired pop music.

Cynics will deem this a gluten free, $12 bread service. More open-minded guests will call them kick-ass, do-it-yourself Italian tacos.

Instead, chef de cuisine Dan Haar sends out porgy, its flesh torched just a bit too long by the grill. No carabinero prawns either. Instead, we get delicate rock shrimp over oregano-perfumed rice. And in place of bottarga, the ultra-briny roe of the red mullet, Santina sends out, well, there’s really no substitute for bottarga is there? At least we get white anchovies, with their assertive oils begging for a glass of prosecco.

And they often do; the bass tartare, a smoky mix of Calabrian chile oil, poblano chile, and cucumber water, can send even the most jaded crudo consumer into culinary fugue state. The minestrone, in turn, shows off the power of meat-free cookery; the lush soup is a study in what happens when a good chef softens the sting of green herbs and sweetens them, with the broth acting as a springboard for the mouth-salivating, MSG-like qualities of grated parmesan.

Better is the rigatoni norma, a smokier, sultrier version of the tomato and eggplant classic.

255,"[""Ambitious cocktail establishments don’t tend to list Whiskey Cola, a caffeinated predecessor to Vodka RedBull, as a marquee offering. This makes sense. Accomplished bartenders refrain from touting such drinks for the same reason that good sommeliers don’t put Veuve Clicquot on their menus; they'd rather expose guests to something a bit more interesting. Whiskey Cola, after all, requires no skill to construct; it tastes no worse when furtively made in a movie theater bathroom stall than when poured at a mahogany counter staffed by bearded men. And really, is an artificially-flavored, mass-produced beverage really the smartest way to show off a good spirit?"", ""So you'd be forgiven for balking at the $14 version at Porchlight, a price that only seems right when you notice the bar is located opposite auto dealerships that sell Lamborghinis, Rolls-Royces, Bentleys, and other cars that cost more than a law degree at Columbia. But passing up on that drink would be a mistake, because it's one of the city’s finest new cocktails."", ""It's unlikely you'll make this version of the drink at home. Nicholas Bennett, the mustachioed head bartender, injects CO2 and phosphoric acid into a batch of corn whiskey and homemade cola syrup, carbonating the entire concoction at once.

Now take a sip. Does the Whiskey Cola taste a bit more complex than usual? That's because Bennett adds a dose of Fernet-Vallet, a Mexican cordial whose medicinal overtones transform the entire concoction into a boozy cardamom-clove-quinine coke.

A great Tuscan craze swept the restaurant industry, emphasizing fresh pastas, seafood, and vegetables in simpler, lighter preparations. Heck, these ascendant cuisines were practically sauceless, decreasing cost and prep time for restaurants increasingly plagued by cash-flow problems.

These days, little differentiates the likes of Coors Light and Bud Light save for advertising campaigns. Now, megabrewers’ lagers are not shoddily made. Enormous skill is required to create colossal-scale lagers that tastes the same no matter where they’re sold, be it Alaska or Alabama. But the era of one-size-fits-all beer is ending. This month, the Brewers Association announced that, volume-wise, craft beer now accounts for 11 percent of the U.S. market and nearly 20 percent of the dollars spent on beer.', 'Photo by Firestone Walker', 'Bitter, aromatic IPAs continue leading the charge, but lately craft brewers have begun to attack brewing conglomerates’ breadwinner: the lager. New Belgium Shift, Anchor California Lager, and Sierra Nevada Nooner Pilsner are prime examples of new-breed lagers that unite flavor and refreshment in a low-alcohol format. They’re the kind of beers you drink when you want more than one—and I always want more than one.', 'The hopped-up pilsner drinks light, crisp, and daintily sweet, with a grassy finish that gently lingers like a bitter kiss.', 'In recent months, the lager most often filling my fridge is\xa0Firestone Walker’s Pivo Hoppy Pils. Under brewmaster\xa0Matt Brynildson, the Paso Robles, California, brewery has become one of America’s most medal-winning and versatile beer makers. From Velvet Merlin Oatmeal Stout to Opal Saison, Union Jack IPA and a line of experimental barrel-aged ales, Firestone Walker rarely makes a wrong turn. And the German-inspired Pivo is no exception.', 'Poured into a glass (yup, I always decant into glassware), the clear Pivo is as golden as a magic-hour sunset. There’s plenty of nose-prickling carbonation and fluffy eggshell foam. Ho-hum, you say. It’s just another lager. Take a taste, though, and you’ll see how Pivo supersedes the status quo. The key is German-grown hops, done in the lavish manner of new-school American IPAs. These special little flowers supply clean baseline bitterness, a gently spicy, herbaceous edge, and an elegant floral aroma. The hopped-up pilsner drinks light, crisp, and daintily sweet, with a grassy finish that gently lingers like a bitter kiss. At 5.3 percent alcohol by volume (Bud, by comparison, is 5 percent ABV), Pivo will keep you upright for the better part of a six-pack.']"
258,"[""For the fine dining naysayers of Manhattan's gilded aughts, the pre-crash years that brought us $1,000 meals at Masa and Per Se, the 2005 debut of Danny Meyer's The Modern represented a welcome counterpoint. Located on the ground floor of MoMA in Midtown, The Modern was where one could enjoy a cocktail or a small plate for less than the twenty bucks it cost to visit the museum. Even if a longer tasting could run hundreds, there was something refreshing about an entry-level culinary experience being more accessible than an entry-level art experience – in the same building, no less. The Modern wasn't a captive audience institution designed to shake down gallery-goers with overpriced panini; it was an independent establishment, with no entry fee, designed to bring in guests who might not have visited a museum in the first place. And now, eleven years later, as the city's gastronomic and artistic centers of gravity have shifted downtown, Meyer has scored with another affordable museum eatery, this one in the Meatpacking District. Welcome to Untitled at the newly-relocated Whitney."", ""The folks to thank here are Michael Anthony, who also runs Meyer's Gramercy Tavern, and chef de cuisine Suzanne Cupps. Together, they're serving some of the city's most accomplished vegetable-forward fare at very reasonable prices. A snack for two – a glass of muscadet, a beer, a pickle plate (with stunning curried cauliflower ribs), and a lemony lobster toast – will cost less, after tax, but before tip, than two $22 tickets to the museum. Call it a boon for those who'd rather take in one of the city's newest pieces of celebrity architecture – Renzo Piano is the designer – while sitting down and eating, instead of while schlepping around the exhibits without booze."", 'Fluke with radish, sorrel, and lime.', ""Meyer, the hospitality guru behind Shake Shack, and Anthony, who once led the kitchen at Stone Barns, are doing important things here with food, wine prices, and even reservations. It's the kind of restaurant whose merits and quirks you'll be pressed to debate with your colleagues – just as you might after seeing Carroll Dunham's NSFW nude on the Whitney's fifth floor. So here are your talking points for Untitled, as well as for Meyer's more casual Studio Cafe on the 8th floor."", ""The Modern still ranks No.1 in the looks department; it's where diners relax in Arne Jacobsen chairs (which individually cost more than a MacBook Pro) while overlooking the museum's serene sculpture garden. But the Piano-designed Untitled, with its sloping ceilings and never-ending glass walls, is a close second. Guests sit in plush Eero Saarinen chairs (about $1,500 retail) while overlooking a down-the-block line of people waiting to get into the museum; it's as if Piano is saying that in the Meatpacking District, the well-heeled street denizens are the real sculptures worthy of observation. The room and the vistas, incidentally, are a heck of a lot prettier than the Whitney itself, which looks like a well-polished 1980s Xerox machine."", ""Here's a quick list of dishes that wouldn't be out of place at even an upscale museum restaurant: burgers, sandwiches, fries, or steaks. And yet Anthony doesn't serve any of the above, not even at lunch. Instead, he sends out the type of edgy, small-to-mid-sized plates that one might encounter at a boundary-pushing restaurant in Brooklyn or the Lower East Side. He gives us chamomile-infused peas with favas, a whisper of summertime sugar, or matzoh-thin flatbread anointed with bacon and creamed corn, a heavier dose of vegetable-based sweetness. He takes beets with yogurt, a fairly run-of-the-mill pairing, and turns the ingredients into an epic cold borscht of sorts; the addition of pickled cherries, sweet cherries, currants and tarragon evoke a fragrant summer evening in the Russian taiga."", 'Above: Roasted and fried chicken and swordfish with eggplant and basil seed vinaigrette; Below: The bar at Untitled', 'This is a kitchen that knows how to indulge. Island Creek oysters are fried so delicately that the texture is akin to an oceanic water balloon, ready to burst with brine. Anthony pairs creamy pole beans and soft calamari in a grilled riff on fritto misto, with an incendiary guajillo salsa for dredging and dunking. And he coats Tokyo turnips with aioli, pecorino, and guanciale, creating a hot, porky, cheesy, root vegetable carbonara.', 'When a sommelier tells you about an off-the-menu pour, it\'s often code for ""this glass of wine costs more than your steak."" That\'s not the case here, where the so-called ""Untitled"" pour, designed to showcase up-and-coming regions and new wine-makers, is among the cheapest by-the-glass selections, at $11. Note to other beverage directors around the city: If you want to encourage novice oenophiles to drink more off-the-beaten track wines, this is how to do it. And here it\'s worth mentioning that while good restaurants rarely sell more than a bottle or two of Champagne at $100 or less, Untitled, taking a cue from sister spot Marta, offers eleven in that range, including a lean, mean, 100 percent pinot meunier (Christophe Mignon) for $69.', '', 'Unlike the rest of the menu, the main courses are more traditionally portioned in the American-style, acting as de facto one-plate meals. So $25 gets you enough over-sauced fettuccine for two, sitting in a virtual soup of tomatoes, while $27 results in a steakhouse-sized portion of lamb chops – the lone red meat entree. Better are the cubes of swordfish over roasted eggplant; take away the delectably oily flesh and the dish would still boast a breathtaking degree of complexity, with a tomato saffron vinaigrette lending a floral counterpoint to the smoky nightshade. And the chicken – Anthony uses an insanely flavorful Green Circle breed – is the game-changing protein here; the breast is roasted on the rotisserie, imparting the skin with a funky, pliable softness, while the soy-and-garlic marinated thighs are fried, evoking a masterful, Japanese-style karaage.', 'Chamomile panna cotta with honey and berries', ""Vegetable-centric restaurants don't need to push squash pudding or tomato soufflé for dessert, but like at any good culinary establishment, the sweet and savory kitchens should at least be speaking the same language, and that's not necessarily the case at Untitled. The postprandial treats of Miro Uskokovic, unlike the innovative fare of chef Anthony, can feel as generic as a pair of khakis at Georgetown University. Cake, be it the peanut butter blueberry variety or chocolate fudge, wouldn't be out of place at any airport restaurant, anywhere in America. And poundcake with strawberries is no better than the supermarket version you could make at home. Panna cotta, bland and overgelatined, is rescued by a tart berry compote, while a coconut and apricot tart packs such a dense shell it flips on its side when you try to cut it. Even the chocolate chunk cookie, while technically brilliant (and delicious), feels out of place on such an ambitious menu."", ""The Studio Cafe, a separate restaurant on the 8th floor, requires a ticket to the Whitney, and therefore qualifies as more of a traditional captive audience venue – an institution that faces little competition because this is inevitably where museum guests will come to refuel without leaving the building. And yet Anthony's mostly-toast menu (cue eye rolling) is as awesome and affordable as anything one might encounter at a cool East Village establishment. Everything's an essay in balance. Cucumbers inject a dose of watery freshness into buttery avocado toast. Green tomato jam imparts acidity to rich cheddar toast. Spicy Thai pickles cut the sweet density of honeyed peanut butter toast. And summery tomatoes, in a more traditional preparation, take the edge off the tartness of goat cheese. They're all $12 each and you enjoy them on the elevated outdoor deck, with its stunning vistas of One World Trade, the Hudson, and The Empire State Building. It's the type of food, and the type of view, that'll alone justify the museum's $85 yearly membership. And it's all enough to make us wonder whether Meyer, the new king of captive audience dining, will find a way to make us want to have dinner at the local DMV or the nearest hospital in the coming years."", 'Cost: All dishes at $27 or under.', 'Sample dishes: Lobster and preserved lemon toast, corn and bacon flatbread, turnips with guanciale and pecorino, roasted and fried chicken.', ""Bonus tip: About 50 percent of the dining room is reserved for walk-ins, or 75 percent if one counts outdoor patio seating – a much larger proportion than at most Danny Meyer restaurants. So don't fret if there's nothing on OpenTable; reservations aren't really necessary."", 'Cost: All dishes at $27 or under.', 'Sample dishes: Lobster and preserved lemon toast, corn and bacon flatbread, turnips with guanciale and pecorino, roasted and fried chicken.']"

At the end of 2012 he finally settled down with Spoon, a small, elegant seafood restaurant in the city's posh Preston Center community. Dazzlers like smoked-sturgeon headcheese with horseradish crème fraîche, a dab of chive gel, and caviar brought him the loudest accolades since his Mansion days. I went last year and joined the chorus of praise.\n  "", 'John Tesar', 'In the glow of Spoon\'s success, the Kimpton group recruited Tesar to run a steakhouse in the local Palomar Hotel (which was just rechristened as The Highland by Hilton, its new operators).

Tesar wades beyond the fray with a pan-carnivorous approach. Bacon receives abundant love on this menu: It gilds bone marrow (with celery leaves and caviar providing much-needed contrast), it comes in pork belly forms in the Changian steamed bun as well as over collards for a Southern lilt, and it stars in its own over-the-top tasting with five variations, including crisped Iberico ham. The crisped ham also shows up winningly as part of an arugula and green apple salad.

Instead, there are are duck wings that rival the finest chicken wings. Smillie confits the drumettes for tenderness, deep fries them in duck fat for crispness, and then slathers them in yuzukosho, the aromatic citrus-chile paste that stands to become the next Sriracha. The meat is salty, with just a hint of game, while the kosho packs all the pucker of a Warhead candy.

What made the Il Buco version brilliant, when I sampled it back in 2012, was its delicious cragginess, pocked with chewy, overdone parts here and there, and studded with peppercorns that were occasionally so warming they bordered on Sichuan-level.', 'At Il Buco, Smillie treated foie gras like a deli meat, draping baloney-like slices of the liver over toast.

265,"[""In season one, episode seven of Parts Unknown, Anthony Bourdain pronounced Peruvian food the next big thing, as he gnawed on beef-heart anticuchos at a Lima street stall and slurped ceviches washed down with pisco sours by the seaside. But is it? Gaston Acurio, Peru's most famous chef, belly flopped here at his high-end La Mar Cebicheria, shutting it down after less than two years. But long before Acurio, New York City possessed a decent collection of small, inexpensive Peruvian cafes aimed at immigrants and rotisserie chicken joints targeting the general population, both mainly found in Queens. Now along comes Jora, a Long Island City gastropub with a concept poised between fancy restaurant and budget café. Is Bourdain right, and can Peruvian cuisine succeed in attracting an enthusiastic citywide clientele?"", 'Named after a strain of Andean corn used to make a fermented beverage called chicha, Jora is located just off Jackson Avenue near the Pulaski Bridge, which funnels traffic from Brooklyn to Queens.

We forged inside to discover a waiting area outfitted with plush couches and a pair of dining rooms sumptuously adorned with gilded Inca motifs. A line of Indian pottery lurked in niches up near the ceiling, making us feel like we were raiding a Pre-Columbian tomb. At the end of the dining rooms we found a rather luxurious bar.

Even before Jora appeared, you could see jalea being munched in taverns up and down Roosevelt Avenue."", ""The starter of octopus squirted with a curious lavender sauce, though, was dull enough to make us scream, which once again suggests the main problem of a gastropub like Jora: the owners don't trust the general public to like chili peppers as much as they do. This can be easily remedied with aji panca, a yellowish chile paste that is readily provided if you ask for it.

(Franklin bought his first pit from John Mueller, LeAnn\'s brother; he currently operates John Mueller Meat Co. Yes, the Austin barbecue lineage is small and inbred.) At lunch a line also stretches from La Barbecue\'s order window, though you can expect to stand for thirty minutes rather than the two to four hours at Franklin. Find a seat at one of the picnic tables sheltered under covered tents.', ""Lewis' brisket reveals an especially crimson ring underneath its crusty, piquant bark. The fat is exquisitely rendered, the texture less crumbly than when I first tried it over a year ago. Velvety pulled pork, tinged with vinegar, reinforces how Texans have taken hold of the pig and now often smoke it with more finesse than counterparts in the Deep South. Cole slaw offers layers of heat from flakes of black pepper and jolts of chipotle in the mayo dressing."", 'Above: Micklethwait; Left: Franklin; Right: La Barbecue', ""La Barbecue's beef rib is righteous, but it sells out quickly. You stand a better chance of nabbing that Flinstonian cut at Micklethwait Craft Meats, a trailer that opened in East Austin in 2012. It receives plenty of attention but still smokes relatively low under the radar. Tom Micklethwait serves the expected meats but also breaks from tradition by concocting sausages made with goat or lamb and occasionally serving a gussied up take on Frito pie. I arrived around 1:15 p.m. on a weekday to find no line. The brisket skewed dry, but the beef rib was sumptuous, like eating pot roast cooked over a campfire. Potato salad, a few degrees from being mashed, was flecked with onion and bell pepper, and the cole slaw's light dressing crunched with poppy seeds. Micklethwait and his crew even bake loaves of fluffy white bread. Tempting carbs are dangerous when trying to consume as much protein as possible, but the effort nonetheless impressed."", 'Seared shrimp with corn and okra at Barley Swine', ""In Austin, it isn't just remarkable barbecue that emerges from doublewides. Bryce Gilmore is the most renowned example: He started Odd Duck Farm to Trailer in 2009, prepping meats and vegetables at the restaurant Jack Allen's Kitchen (run by his father, Jack Gilmore) and turning out smart creations like grilled romaine lettuce with goat's milk ricotta and poached egg or pulled duck over ciabatta. Booming success led Gilmore to open Barley Swine in December 2010, a tiny space with thick wooden beams, craggy stone walls, and an open kitchen. Pig trotters and pork belly shared the menu with grilled broccoli with fermented chile and duck egg or pasta filled with smoked fish and pureed potato. Servers knew as much about the far-flung beer list as they did about the food."", '', 'A year ago, Barley Swine shifted to a $75 tasting menu format in anticipation of this year\'s resurrection of Odd Duck, now a brick-and-mortar owned by Bryce Gilmore, his brother Dylan, and chefs Mark Buley and Sam Hellman-Mass. I dined at both recently and found the cooking on equal footing. Which experience is more enjoyable depends on your format preferences. My meal at Odd Duck was buoyed by the giddiness of cooks who know they\'re grooving in a creative sweet spot. They took turns coming out of the kitchen to present their latest alchemies. Tender goat confit bathed in red chile starred in a wonderfully gloppy tower anchored by a gordita, scattered with popcorn, and sauced with thinned goat cheese. ""Pig face Cuban sandwich"" was forward in all the right ways — crisp, unctuous, mustardy. The kichen showed its (relative) demure side with lemony shrimp salad, nestled in Bibb lettuce leaves with fried potato and tangles of red onion. The nuttiness of mesquite bean ice cream elevated an already striking apple cake doughnut dripping with cider glaze.', ""Cider also sparked the first bite of 15 courses at Barley Swine — a plump Gigamoto oyster glossed with the fermented apple juice blended with wasabi. It set the tone for the series of one- to three-bite dishes that comprised the meal. The cooks elegantly volleyed between compositions that evoked Texas and elsewhere. Texas: A corn muffin piled with velvety pork shoulder ham. Cured goat loin served like tartare and layered with eggplant, pine nuts, and minced rings of shishito pepper. One beautifully seared Gulf shrimp in a ceramic bowl over corn and sliced okra. Elsewhere: roasted chicken dumpling served on a spoon with sorghum vinegar. A gorgeous salmon chip with yogurt and smoked roe. And a strange rectangle of brioche spread with fig jam draped with a lobe of sea urchin. The restaurant nailed the beverage pairings by alternating between wines and beers: Spanish cava, Japanese red rice ale, Hungarian furmint (citrusy and sweet), Belgian ale. The ingredient combinations may occasionally surprise, but Barley Swine couldn't make a tasting menu experience any more accessible."", 'Food at Odd Duck: Above: Goat confit in red chile with gordita; Left: Grilled okra with field peas and ricotta; Right: Apple doughnut with mesquite bean ice cream', ""Paul Qui's seven-course menus, on the other hand, dangle diners just over the edge of comfort. Qui has long had an instinct for knowing when and how to prod palates into bolder frontiers. For eight years he worked with Tyson Cole at Uchi, the Japanese restaurant that put Austin on the culinary map as a city for more than barbecue. Cole made Qui at executive chef at Uchiko, the finer dining spinoff serving beauties like karaage with green apple and pickled watermelon rind that brought Qui a James Beard award for Best Southwestern Chef in 2012. (He also took the crown on Top Chef's ninth season that year.) Under a national spotlight, he opened his own restaurant, Qui, in East Austin last June.

Inside, the sweeping kitchen resembles a workshop, with more than a dozen staffers hustling behind the line at any given time."", 'It was hard to be squeamish about pork blood when its primal funk melded so seamlessly with earthy maitake mushrooms and garlic.', ""Qui's imagination circles the globe, and his menus (one omnivorous and the other dedicated to vegetables) rove with it. The first courses from a recent meal recalled Spain. Marcona almond gazpacho, one of the few standards in Qui's repertoire, provided a launching pad for gelee made from Pedro Ximenez sherry, fennel fronds, and foie gras terrine presented to resemble white chocolate shavings. On the vegetarian side, a duly compelling bowl of caramelized onion jus with another sherry gelee (this one made with nutty Amontillado), Valdeon cheese, and ciabatta croutons. Japanese influences came in the forms of yuzu caramel, ono (a Hawaiian fish) grilled over Binchotan coals, and the attuned ponzu that brightened mackerel crudo."", ""But the most exhilarating dishes drew on Qui's Filipino heritage. It was hard to be squeamish about pork blood when its primal funk melded so seamlessly with earthy maitake mushrooms and garlic. Peanut curry with green beans and puffed rice satisfied with its direct flavors. And a separate patio menu pulled from the Filipino lexicon in clever ways: I loved the pork and shrimp lumpia, a Southeast Asian spring roll, presented unfolded like a taco. Even a cheddar cheese ice cream sandwich, which sounds like wackiness culled from a grocery store's frozen food aisle, was inspired by the frozen cheese treats Qui snacked on as a child in the Philippines. Qui uses clothbound cheddar from Vermont's Cabot Creamery to make the confection, and he gilds it with goat's milk cajeta.

His front-of-house staff can discuss the nuances of a riso marinara (with seafood and no tomato) or an apricot-scented Pinot Bianco without sermonizing or lecturing. Even his dishwashers have been around since the beginning."", 'Stuckey met his future business partner, chef Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson, when they both worked at The French Laundry in the 2000s. The two reconnected in Colorado and decided on the cuisine — the specialties of Friuli Venezia Giulia in northeastern Italy, bordered by Austria and Slovenia — solely because they liked one of the region\'s traditions. Families serving meals from their homes would hang branches, or ""frascas,"" above their doors as a signal to passersby. Of course it helped that Stuckey, who earned a Master Sommelier title, was fond of the sophisticated Friulian wines (including unusually striking Pinot Grigios) that he\'s since helped popularize in the U.S.', ""While the food doesn't seem quite as exotic as it once did, the cooking is still singular."", ""Ten years in, as the American palate has developed, the food served at Frasca doesn't seem quite as exotic. The cooking, though, was as singular as my first meal at the restaurant eight years ago."", 'While sipping a sparkly or a ""tajut"" (small glass) of Friulian Malvasia with its notes of honeydew and mint, start by trying frico caldo, a crisp potato cake snack with soft onions and melty Montassio cheese. Then face the hard decision: Order the four-course menu, customizable with five or so choices of broader Italian dishes within each category, or the set seven-course chef\'s tasting option that showcases Friulian specialties?', 'I lean toward the latter for its novelty and intense flavors. A generous glug of creamy, peppery Venetian olive gilded the riso marinara, lush with minced shrimp, scallops, clams, oysters, and mussels. Lacy strands of chicken, slivers of matsutake mushrooms, and a molten tangle of leeks bolstered the earthy savor of blecs — wide, speckled buckwheat pasta. ""Maiale Invecchiato"" paired a dry-aged and roasted pork chop with mussetto, a potent Friulian pork sausage made with head meat, fat back, and skin. Braised kale and roasted carrots cut the richness.

And the wine list, now weighing in at 67 pages, travels far beyond the margins of Fruili. The Francophiles, the lovers of Napa fruit bombs, and the international bargain hunters all drink spectacularly at Frasca.', ""I saved enough room to slip next door afterward for a bite at Stuckey and Mackinnon-Patterson's Pizzeria Locale. The cook pulled a puffy lipped, handsomely misshapen sausage and broccoli pie from the tiled Stefano Ferrara oven shipped from Naples. Lovely. I was curious about Pizzeria Locale because the duo revealed late last year that they were\xa0partnering with Chipotle on a fast-casual version of the concept, the first of which opened in Denver in May 2013. Of course it's expected that successful restaurateurs will eventually expand their reach, but I'd worried that the growing business ventures would ruffle the familial qualities that make Frasca so special. Stuckey's presence reassured that wintry night.

And I don’t mean the cocktails, which are stunning. I mean the bar itself. ""Every morning I come to work and I sand it down,"" chef and owner Nick Kim tells me. He forged the C-shaped counter from unfinished tamo, a type of Japanese ash used in Taylor-brand acoustic guitars. It evokes the the soft hinoki wood found at Masa, where Kim worked as head sushi chef in the mid-aughts. ""It\'s one solid tree that we butterflied,"" Kim says. ""The surface that you\'re touching is the middle of the tree."" Sexy.', ""When you’re in between bites of Santa Barbara uni, instead of checking your iPhone, you find yourself rubbing the silky counter back and forth. The sensation is electric. It's not dissimilar from the tactile high you get when picking up a light-as-air Zalto stem, the only wine glass you’ll encounter in this dimly lit abode just south of Union Square."", 'Inside Shuko', ""Kim and his co-chef and co-owner, Jimmy Lau, have come a long way from Neta, their old 8th Street hangout where neither the brightly lit space nor the uneven food (early on, at least), matched the prices they were charging. Here, you know where your dough is going. That's good because Shuko isn’t just one of New York’s most exciting new Japanese restaurants — it’s one of the most expensive ones as well."", 'The kaiseki menu runs $175, while a shorter sushi-only omakase costs $135. Either way, the first course is a stunner: two bites of homemade mochi, with pistachio miso and shiso. The taste is akin to putting a Michelin-starred piece of nut and mint-flavored Bubblicious in your mouth, a squishy, savory dessert at the beginning of the meal. Three hours later you and your date are eating a slice of apple pie, $500 poorer, and none the worse off. But since the price tag is as high as it is, here are here are five things you need to know before you spend you hard-earned cash at Shuko.', 'Above: Crispy trout skin with uni and trout roe. Below: Toro sushi; lobster with celery caulifower, maitake mushrooms, smoked bacon, truffles, and soy butter.', ""The math is simple; the $135 omakase involves 20 pieces of sushi, while the kaiseki, for only $40 more, includes eight composed courses plus 17 pieces of sushi. Shuko's kitchen treats its ingredients with a delicate hand. The chefs amp up the natural sweetness of Dungeness crab with a hint of bonito-infused soy vinegar, while keeping the sugars in check with cucumber and chrysanthemum. Firm Chinese schrenckii caviar acts as a very expensive salt for a mound of toro tartare. And squab breast, walking that tightrope between livery and gamy, gets its natural umami essence amplified through a simple yet intense sauce reduced from the bird's bones. Getting full? Well here comes the sushi. So if you've got the scratch for a second visit, do the cheaper menu to save more stomach space for raw fish over rice."", '1. There’s no set price for pairings; discuss your budget as sommeliers can negotiate matching beverages for as low as $45-$55.', '2. Champagne costs $30 by the glass (Chartogne Taillet Brut), but the better buy is the same producer by the bottle for $90, in brut or rosé. After that, the price moves up to $120 for a Savart 1er Cru (still a good deal).', '3. Your go-to aromatic white by the glass is the Gunther Steinmetz Riesling ($17), with just enough acidity to cut through the richness of even the fattiest toro.', '4. Expect just three or so sakes by the glass, at $15-$20. At the more expensive end of that spectrum is the Dassai 50, a junmai daiginjo with faintly sweet floral notes that won’t interfere with any of the delicate fish.', ""5. Hard alcohol isn't the best beverage pairing to bring out the subtleties of sushi, but forgoing Shuko’s mixed drinks ($16) would mean overlooking one of the city’s better restaurant cocktail programs. Start off with the Bob Dillin, a mix of gin, fennel liquor, and eucalyptus aromatic, then move onto the Island Manhattan, with a strong dose of Venezuelan rum for molasses, and a bit of Agricole rum for bite."", 'Unlike the two Michelin-starred Ichimura, which begins most meals with a sashimi course to whet the palate (and to show off the chef\'s knife skills), Shuko does something a little bit different: Kim throws in pieces of raw fish throughout the sushi portion of the meal. So before a slice of giant clam over rice, he’ll serve it plain first, to let you appreciate the mollusk’s intoxicating cucumber crunch. He’ll give you a spoonful of uni from ""in between Santa Barbara and Monterey Bay,"" so you can better discern its concentrated kinship with Maine urchin. Got it? Now you\'re ready for the orange roe over rice.', 'This is all somewhat atypical, as a sushi course often consists of sushi and nothing else. Shuko trades in gentle aberrations. If the palate starts to feel overwhelmed after a slice of creamy sawawa or fatty ocean trout, Lau might toss over a slice of vinegared cucumber, or a knob of daikon. It makes you want to eat more. And like at Masa, the final piece before dessert is pickled lotus root wrapped around shiso; it awakens your senses before the sweets appear.', 'Kim hands you a slice of o-toro over rice. Pick it up, let the fat melt slowly on your tongue, and then wait for that irony oceanic tang, which hangs around on the palate for a good 30 seconds after swallowing. This is the beef of the sea. Enjoy that bite, because there’s not a lot of it here. Instead of the tuna-paloozas that are common elsewhere (Ichimura is famous for stacking up to three slices on a single piece of rice), Shuko often only serves about two pieces of the meaty delicacy as part of the $135 menu, or three if you count the excellent sinew, which Kim grills over the binchotan and places in a hammock of nori. The texture is pure foie gras. Fat will dribble down your chin. For those with environmental qualms about eating too much bluefin: Shuko gets much of its fish from sustainable farmed raised fish in Spain.', ""With less tuna comes more room to enjoy Shuko's more aggressively-flavored cuts"", ""With less tuna comes more room to enjoy Shuko's more aggressively-flavored cuts —Kim is a fiend for mollusks. If that giant clam crunches like a snappy, watery vegetable, then the gently funky orange clam slowly builds on your tongue like a tidal pool of moss.

He cuts a mash of ocean trout with sansho and Sichuan peppercorns and does the same with maitake mushrooms over crispy rice, an epic mix of earthy fungi and lingering heat. As more traditional sushi (and fine dining chefs) needlessly keep the Scoville meter in check, Shuko likes to lay it on hot.', ""On my visits, Nick and Lau didn't quite keep their rice consistently firm. The grains here don’t always roll around on the tongue as they should, like balls of good caviar, separate and distinct. Sometimes they mush too easily. Sometimes they lack enough vinegar. Sometimes they’re topped with just a hint too much wasabi. And sometimes they’re perfect. This is not a minor issue, but still, you’re able to overlook this technical qualm when you’re eating such thought provoking preparations with pristine fish."", ""As the meal winds down one night, I ask Kim about his work at Masa.

An order of soufflé potatoes, like puffy fries, arrived tepid; our server whisked them away with a nod and soon returned with a fresher batch. The flesh of fried trout prepared amandine style crackled against the teeth; a scattering of slivered almonds echoed the crunch. Brown butter and crabmeat heightened the sweetness of pompano, the restaurant's default fish special. I've been eating at Galatoire's since the 1990s but never had a meal impressed me more: There was a finer tuning to the preparations than in years past.

Some entrees would always be straightforward, modern plates (say, a lusty pork chop with bacony field peas and kale), and a Southerner could always count on a familiar totem or two, like rich, crisp-edged cornbread or boiled peanuts."", 'Sweet potato chess pie', ""But I did love the more historical slant to this recent menu. Chefs often overlook the time-honored in favor of the novel, and it was gratifying to see what a skilled kitchen could do with homey and genteel dishes that so clearly evoked the region. Brock and his team approach the Husk menus like Buddhist sand mandalas: They build them and then wipe them away, starting anew the next day. Similar patterns may reappear, but the design is never quite the same. I know such a sharp gaze back in time isn't — nor should it be — permanent. I was glad to experience it as part of the repertoire, though."", ""Brock left Nashville in 2006 to take the job as executive chef at McCrady's in Charleston, a title he still retains. The origins of McCrady's as a tavern stretch back to 1788, but Brock yanked the menu into the new millennium by weaving into multi-course menus things like shrimp stock gelled into sheets and olive oil frozen via liquid nitrogen. These days, the overt modernist fillips have largely disappeared. McCrady's remains a restaurant where Brock and chef de cuisine Daniel Heinze can interweave seasonal Lowcountry bounty with a global notion or two; Husk Charleston, by intention, is more focused in its Southern identity."", 'The cooking at Husk Nashville synthesizes the whole of Brock\'s culinary personality.

The collage pulled from the Southern larder sure enough, but it spun the flavors into a delicious, alternate universe.

It's so rich that we cleanse our palates not with wine but with butter-laden pommes puree, which is like drinking a double espresso to come down from an eight ball and a can of Four Loko. Now you know.\n  "", 'Interior of Dirty French. All photos by Daniel Krieger', 'How does it all taste? Bite into the beef and a peppery crust gives way to a crimson, silky interior.

The flavor is clean and sweet, the tell-tale sign of a proper grass-feeding. Want more tang? Take that funghi and fat carpaccio and drape it over the beef; the funk is so intense I ask if the chefs slipped a little blue cheese in there. They did not.', ""How much does it cost? The smallest cut was $167, which works out to over $200 after tax and tip.

It is rather a globally-minded Gallic chophouse and seafood emporium, with nods to India, Southeast Asia, North Africa, and thanks to Cajun-spiced porgy, Creole Country. If Keith McNally\'s lovely Cherche Midi is a hat tip to the old ways of fancypants French dining, with its cheese soufflées, frog legs, and île flottantes, Dirty is a look toward the diverse and diaspora-fueled future of high-end French fare.

It contains no phyllo. Chef Rich Torrisi slices royal trumpet mushrooms on a mandoline, presses the leaves of funghi into a mold, roasts them, and finishes the vegetarian terrine with bright green curry. It's as delicate and buttery as baklava — until the coconut and coriander of the verdant sauce kick everything into overdrive.

Close to midnight on Thursday, there's a Ferrari parked in front and Dirty French is packed with well-dressed folks drinking $16 cocktails or good Champagne (there are five bottles under $100).

273,"[""\n  Our first restaurants from Uzbekistan appeared in the 90s in Hell's Kitchen and the Diamond District, dispensing charcoal-grilled kebabs to a mixed constituency of Orthodox Jewish gem traders and barbecue-obsessed destination diners. At Gan Eden on 47th Street, the luscious, grease-glistening brochettes were cooked next to an open window over a baking sheet filled with lump charcoal — making patrons fear asphyxiation. They came in droves anyway. Subsequent larger restaurants appeared in Rego Park, Queens, and Borough Park, Brooklyn, offering full menus from the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Tashkent, where Silk Road influences informed a cuisine of noodle-bearing soups, meaty rice pilafs, circular breads indented in the middle, purse-shaped dumplings, and those charcoal-grilled kebabs we first fell in love with.\n  "", 'But many of the two dozen or so newer establishments catered mainly to interminable Russian banquets, where the vodka flowed more freely than the food, and tables of only three or four intent on having a normal-length meal and ordering from the menu were made to feel like unwanted orphans. But now a new place called Uzbechka has appeared on Avenue O in an obscure corner of Bensonhurst, much friendlier to outsiders and small parties alike. The immigrant family that runs the place — two brothers, one sister, a mother, and an uncle — settled in Kansas City and Key West before moving to Brooklyn and have thereby acquired a certain savvy where American restaurants are concerned. And the younger members speak perfect idiomatic English, just in case your Russian or Farsi is rusty.', 'Uzbechka\'s menu has its specific origins in Tashkent, a city of two million in the eastern region of the country that was razed by Genghis Khan in the 13th century. The interior of the large dining room offers two rows of tables under swooshes of colorful fabric that make the interior feel like a caravanserai; the walls are plastered with photos of craftspeople, cooks, and monuments in fanciful frames. (""My uncle made those frames,"" our waitress proudly announced.) An impromptu stage framed in Persian carpets is found at the far end of the room, where a door leads to a tented backyard seating area that will be quite an asset when warmer weather returns.', 'Lagman soup and Uzbechka salad', 'The Tashkent take on the national dish of plov incorporates carrots, chick peas, yellow raisins, and fatty chunks of lamb into a wonderfully oily rice pilaf. The $8 serving will easily give four diners a good taste. If you were back in Tashkent, the dish might also include horsemeat sausage. Another city themed dish is called Tashkent salad, which makes surprising use of shredded daikon and a green radish native to China, along with lamb, sauteed onions, and boiled eggs, ""with a little bit of mayo,"" as the menu charmingly puts it.', ""While the bill of fare offers a bumper crop of salads, most deploy meat and much larger quantities of mayo and thus may not conform with your ideas about salads. An exception is achichuk ($6.50), which is mainly ripe tomatoes and slightly pickled onions in a light vinaigrette, wearing a lovely carved crown of cucumber like a medieval potentate. Named after the restaurant, Ubechka salad ($9) finds the family (they take turns cooking) freestyling with a bewildering array of Western ingredients, ranging from kielbasa and beef to cheddar cheese and corn, with crunchy potato straws on top. Reflecting their time spent in America, there's a Caesar salad, too."", 'Manti; Kebabs', 'You could begin with composed salads and then go right to the kebabs, or you could commence instead with apps like manti (beautiful lamb dumplings served with dilled yogurt) or samsa (flaky and deeply brown meat pastries dotted with sesame seeds). Alternatively, you could start with soups ($6.99 each): the most famous is lagman, based on a rich beef-and-vegetable broth and swarming with long, irregular, handmade noodles — by legend the ones Marco Polo discovered and brought back to Italy. If you believe that, I have an ornate Silk Road mosque to sell you.', 'The lagman served at Uzbechka is indeed one of the best in town, but even better is okroshka, a cold yogurt soup whose pale white surface bobs with potatoes and radishes, while fresh herbs float on its surface and a beef julienne lurks in its depths. The soup is supremely tart and tasty and resembles something you might find in a health-food restaurant. Unfortunately, as colder months arrive, okroshka disappears from the menu.', 'On to the kebabs! As a barbecue lover, they might be your entire motive for visiting Uzbechka. Heavily laced with onions and lamb fat, the ground-meat lyulya kebab is the smokiest, reeking of animal funk. Referred to as ""chicken soft"" — meaning it has benefited from a yogurt marinade in the Persian fashion — the chicken skewers are tender and flavorful. While lamb-chunk kebabs are often tough in Central Asian places, here they\'re not. As for the liver: liver is liver, and charcoal does little to improve it. Other choices include not-bad beef kebabs, luxury lamb chops, and exceedingly fatty lamb ribs. If you\'re ordering kebabs for a table of three or four, why not get all seven ($26)? Which is a steal for such a large heap of meat. And don\'t forget the dill-dusted french fries ($3.25). Though they didn\'t originate in Uzbekistan, the fries are the kebabs\' natural companion on any continent.']"

Dependable Cuban sandwich cafes thrive, and there are the homegrown successes like Michael's Genuine Food & Drink in the Design District and Miami Beach's Pubbelly that have spawned flourishing restaurant groups. But the city also rivals Las Vegas in its appetite for glittery concepts imported by national and international celebrity chefs. The lure of their bespangled dining rooms, housed mostly in hotels and resorts along the water, proves powerful. Over the years, though, I've found too many of them inconsistent, particularly beyond the first months in business when the parent company turns its attention to the next project. Even spinoffs from local talent can be uneven: A recent lunch at Seagrape — a new restaurant in the freshly renovated Thompson Hotel helmed by Michelle Bernstein, a chef whose food I usually admire — proved a letdown with fishy grilled snapper and lackluster salads."", ""So for a deeper look into the city's dining culture, I decided to home in on Miami's Latin flavors and see where they led. Cuban exiles began enriching the city's culture as far back as 1959. In the half-century since, South Florida has become a magnet for immigrants from countries all across the Caribbean, Central America, and South America.

Color detonates from every corner of the restaurant; murals by Haitian artists cover the walls and the tables. Tourists as well as local Haitian expats fill the labyrinth of dining rooms, sipping rum cocktails laced with passion fruit or lime and sharing dishes like fried chunks of goat with a vinegary dipping sauce; grilled conch, chewy but satisfying; and shrimp in coconut sauce. I hadn't been to Tap Tap in a decade. This time I was particularly taken with a plate of spaghetti tossed with tomato, onion, and potent, anchovy-like bits of herring.

I asked the two staffers which protein I should order with my mofongo. ""Mahi,"" they said in unison. It was an unexpected answer but sound advice, the fish pleasantly oceanic against the earthy mound of plantains and the moat of tomato-based Creole sauce.', ""Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co.'s Media noche croquetas and Cubano"", ""Of course my quest needed at least a quick dive into Cuban food. When I inquired after the city's model Cuban sandwich, several locals pointed me to Enriqueta's, a breakfast and lunch staple in Wynwood long before the community began its ascent into gentrification. It was the Cubano of the mind's eye and palate, the shiny, oblong bread griddled to crispness and the pressed stack of thinly sliced meats exclamatory with mustard and pickles. It held up well against a powerhouse new Little Havana contender, Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co., launched in November by Alberto Cabrera. He also operates Bread + Butter in Coral Gables, where he serves pork-filled empanadas, grits with oxtail meat, and other dishes inspired by his Cuban-American heritage."", ""Before opening Little Bread, Cabrera visited Cochon Butcher in New Orleans as creative stimulus for re-engineering his version of the Cubano. His cooks stack black forest ham, salami, pork belly rillettes, and Swiss cheese; heat them on a baking sheet in a massive red smoker for a few minutes; and then transfer them to a squishy toasted roll slathered with mustard aioli and pickled mustard seeds. The bread didn't have the archetypal crunch, but in every other way it was a superior sandwich. A fun appetizer of croquetas suffused with the flavors of a media noche, the Cubano variation made with sweet bread, reinforced how masterfully Cabrera owns this iconic mix of flavors and textures."", 'Arroz con mariscos at La Mar', ""Peruvian is arguably Miami's most in-demand Latin American cuisine after Cuban.

And a second outpost of downtown Miami restaurant Ceviche 105 on Lincoln Road successfully remade itself in a South Beach image, all sleek lines and sexy shadows and outbursts of tropical hues.

I’m guessing, though, that he might quickly drop some aspects to his 15-course tasting menu that recall the sillier facets of U.S. molecular gastronomy madness from a decade ago. For example, after a starting round of empanadas and ropa vieja splattered with peanut sauce, my friend and I soon had metal bowls in front of us.

275,"[""\n  The homemade soba delivered toward the end of an omakase meal at Tei-An was served on a traditional woven bamboo mat. But the noodles also came with an avant-garde accessory: a whopping block of ice. It loomed large atop the nest of chilled soba, catching the light like an obscene diamond or some sacred object carried by the White Walkers on Game of Thrones. The frozen bling was meant to give the soba a stroke of sex appeal. We're living in the age of ramen, the extrovert among Japanese noodles with its steamy pork-bone broth and its garnishes of just-set egg, whiskery scallions, and glossy meats. Soba, best eaten simply to appreciate its subtleties, can by comparison seem meditative, perhaps even dull.\n  "", 'Chilled soba noodles with ice block', 'There was nothing banal, though, about the taupe strands that Teiichi ""Teach"" Sakurai, Tei-An\'s chef-owner, crafts daily. They had life force. As with the differences in fresh and dried Italian pastas, Sakurai\'s handiwork sidestepped the brittle or waterlogged textures that often plague packaged soba. These briefly resisted against the teeth before yielding their flavor, faint but pleasing with buckwheat\'s distinct, roasty earthiness. A turquoise ceramic cup alongside held a dipping sauce of dashi and keishi (soy sauce, mirin, and sugar) simmered with duck meat and skin. I dunked and swished tangles of noodles, slurped, and repeated. When the last noodle disappeared, a server rushed over to pour hot soba cooking water into the cup to create a few sips of liquid umami.', ""If Dallas doesn't rank as one of the country's great bastions of Asian cuisines, North Texas food lovers nonetheless know that they have something special in Sakurai. I lived in Dallas when he opened Tei-An in 2008; I consider him one of the country's outstanding and\xa0— outside the city — largely unsung Japanese chefs. A native of Tokyo, Sakurai brought Dallas its first true-minded sushi bar with Teppo in 1995, and soon after introduced Japanese-style grilling (not the Americanized clowning where cooks juggle knives) at Tei Tei Robata Bar."", ""Some Japanese chefs famously devote their career to perfecting one dish or genre. Sakurai's driving curiosity spurred him last decade to sell both businesses to employees and devote himself to soba, a famously querulous dough (with its ratio of eighty-percent buckwheat and twenty-percent wheat) to form and cut. In preparation for launching Tei An, one of the anchors in the One Arts District complex near downtown, Sakurai returned briefly to his hometown to study at the Tsukiji Soba Academy. In keeping with the ritual around eating soba, he designed a sanctuary of a restaurant: calm lines, grainy woods, and a rock garden with a trickling fountain in the center of the prominent soba bar. (A window behind the bar looks into the room where Sakurai makes the noodles.) A separate bar area in the front caters to a rowdier crowd."", 'Above: Sanma mackerel; Left: Crab and uni risotto; Right: Caviar nigiri', 'Not that one shouldn\'t be imbibing. Sakurai gave an instructive quote when I wrote about Tei An for the Dallas Morning News: ""When I was young, my grandfather told me over and over, ‘Teiichi, never drink sake at a sushi bar. Sake is for drinking at soba houses. Drink sake and enjoy appetizers first, and then, at the very end of the meal, enjoy the soba.\'"" Heed grandpa\'s words. There are sakes here that meet every budget and taste, and the staff, many of whom have been with Sakurai since the restaurant opened, are skilled guides.', ""In the six years since Tei An launched, its menu has grown three-fold to accommodate diverse tastes. Look for the purest expressions of Japanese cooking, like a salad of fluttery white seaweed, cucumbers, and carrots dressed in white vinegar, or cubes of silky-crisp tofu coated in buckwheat flour and deep-fried. Specials might include smoked salmon collar or a buckwheat version of okonomiyaki, a pancake filled with vegetables and seafood. The specials also wade into Sakurai's cross-cultural whimsies, like caviar nigiri or crab and uni risotto served in the crab's hollow shell. Though I prefer the more strictly Japanese dishes, these adjuncts are undeniably delicious."", ""I'm definitely less inclined toward the soba variations sauced in riffs on carbonara or Bolognese. Sakurai views them as gateway pleasures for the uninitiated. My hope is that diners will come to appreciate the soba in its sublime purity, paired with dipping sauces like black sesame or matched with greaseless tempura for stouter appetites."", ""To best understand Sakurai's mastery, call ahead to request the seven-course, $100 omakase, built around a gamut of techniques. My recent meal began with sashimi and then custardy, saffron-hued egg, steamed with dashi, returned to its shell, and topped with one sliver of musky black truffle. Next, two exquisite seasonal treats: tempura of woodsy matsutake mushrooms, which grow wild around white or red pines in Japan. They sat in a crackly cluster alongside a small bowl of gohan, rice flavored with the matsutakes. Now something grilled: sanma mackerel. Sakurai appeared from the kitchen to tell us how these fish swim down from northern Japan in the fall and are caught off the waters of the central Chiba prefecture. If the fish swim too far south, Sakurai said, they lose too much fat and aren't as luscious."", 'Soba and tempura', 'Before the ice sculpture soba finale, there was one more delicacy: A5 wagyu beef, from the Miyazaki prefecture along the southeastern coast of Kyushu island, so marbled in even patterns of pink meat and white fat that it looked more like a dress print than dinner. A staffer seared a few slices for each for us on a hot stone. After the soba there was a gentle denouement with dorayaki, a spongy pancake filled with sweetened red bean paste. I felt deeply and precisely sated.', ""Now that I've enumerated Tei-An's singular qualities, it's probably time to mention that the place also serves what many regard as the finest bowl of tonkotsu ramen in Dallas — the broth textbook milky, the chashu pork sweet, saline, and limpid. Also: Sakurai is opening a ramen bar called Ten in early 2015. It'll be a smash, no doubt. But when the ramen carousers need repose, the temple of soba will be waiting."", ""Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

276,"['', ""Shake Shack, with its crave-worthy burgers for sale in Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere, might have become the global entry point for The Danny Meyer Hospitality Experience, but make no mistake: Manhattan's Gramercy Tavern is the heart and soul of that culinary empire. That’s all the more true as Meyer gets ready to shutter his beloved Union Square Cafe, a move that will make Gramercy, founded in 1994, his oldest restaurant. This reliable (and perennially-packed) mainstay is, without question, New York’s quintessential American restaurant, a status affirmed over the course of two recent visits by Eater critics Ryan Sutton and Robert Sietsema. Below, they both provide their takes."", 'In an age when big ticket restaurants open nearly every day, when expensive and wildly creative tasting menus are a given, and when a cornucopia of small but colorful ingredients often explode across the city\'s small plates, we tend to forget how revolutionary Gramercy Tavern was when it was debuted in 1994 by Danny Meyer and Tom Colicchio. Ruth Reichl gave the place two stars in 1994, noting somewhat shaky service and a few menu missteps, but also declaring, ""Gramercy Tavern is a grand attempt to reinvent the American luxury restaurant."" By 1996, she\'d upped her rating to three stars, offering unstinting praise for Colicchio\'s cooking.', 'It seemed like an entirely new sort of restaurant.', ""My East Village pals and I were well aware of Gramercy Tavern, too. It seemed like an entirely new sort of restaurant. While we'd never dared set foot in a luxury French establishment, Gramercy Tavern seemed strangely accessible, and the lure was the cheaper bar menu in the front room. I remember going several times in the mid-90s, happily downing a leg-of-lamb sandwich and a beer. The meat was richly textured, smoky like barbecue, and almost gamy. Most important, a satisfying meal could be had for $20 or so, a splurge my friends and I could afford."", ""Some tip their hats to Larry Forgione’s 1980s-era relic, American Place, in helping to break the French stranglehold on East Coast fine dining. But let's be real. Gramercy Tavern is the one that’s still alive and thriving. The 20th Street space has been sending out vegetable-focused tasting menus in the formal dining room long before it was the cool thing to do, and the more casual Tavern Room has been whipping up ambitious and affordable fare to a no-reservations crowd years before Momofuku Ssam Bar or Roberta’s championed that stripped-down style of dining."", 'Gramercy, like any decades-old establishment, went through at least one rough patch, when Michael Anthony took over the kitchen reins in 2006. Alan Richman of Bloomberg News (where I worked at the time) responded to his young tenure with a fast and furious takedown. But things improved soon after, and now, eight years later, Anthony is putting out clean American fare that’s occasionally as breathtaking as anything at Dan Barber’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns.', ""Above: Gramercy Tavern's formal dining room; Below: Turnips and Celery root chowder"", 'The formal dining room is where half of the magic happens. So many chefs send out raw scallops with citrus, most of which are too cold, too bland, too acidic, or too sweet. Here, they could pass muster at Masa. Anthony’s Peconic bay mollusks pack that delicate balance of sugar and brine, with such a modicum of yuzu you wonder whether the fragrant Japanese fruit is simply a figment of your imagination.', 'That fine shellfish course, incidentally, kicks off a seven-course affair that could easily cost $150 at a lesser restaurant. Gramercy asks just $120 for its vegetable-heavy chef’s tasting, an exceedingly reasonable price tag. And for a few dollars less, Anthony also sells a $102 menu of equal length with even more vegetables (and no meat), as well as a $92 three-course menu (for those who get stressed out by small plates).', '""The menu is all about celebrating modest ingredients,"" Anthony tells me, which is why we have dashi-braised turnips with turnip foam — edible rubies on a plate. He stuffs beets inside ravioli for a crimson punch of sugar and forges his finishing sauce not from a pound of cream but from a lighter parsnip puree. And he transforms lobster from a dominant protein into a equal dance partner for seasonal vegetables.', 'The tasting showed off clean, clear, accessible flavors.', 'The tasting was quick by modern standards — about two and a half hours — and showed off clean, clear, accessible flavors. Sous-vide squash did its best impression of a ham steak, with the vegetable’s heft emphasized over its delicate sweetness. Anthony turned seafood chowder into study of surf and earth: flavors of ocean and brine (trout roe, halibut, mussels), contrasted against rich celery root soup (which, alas, didn’t exhibit any of the clam stock it was supposedly made with). And for a clever curveball, the kitchen slipped petals of brussels sprouts underneath three slices of duck breast, gently perfuming the gamy protein with their verdant musk.', 'One downside: Desserts by pastry chef Miro Uskovic didn’t manifest the same degree of compelling clarity as the savory courses; we sampled a run-of-the-mill banana pudding with the vegetable tasting, and a gritty pear panna cotta with sherry granita as a finale to the regular tasting.', ""The waiters in their vests, ties, and neatly pressed shirts swept soundlessly from room to room, appearing and then disappearing through arches and behind pillars. The seasonal tasting menu proved heavy on the seafood, with nearly as many vegetables as the vegetable tasting menu, emphasizing seasonal turnips, tubers, and squashes. Starches were nearly nonexistent. If you craved meat, you were as equally out of luck on either menu. By current standards both bills of fare were a good value, given the number of courses, quality of the food, real estate occupied by the restaurant, and ambiance. I've paid more for less on obscure streets in Brooklyn."", ""I've paid more for less on obscure streets in Brooklyn."", ""Striking a New England note, the so-called celery root chowder on the seasonal menu was my favorite. The name was perplexing, since the soup contained a stamp-size swatch of halibut, two or three mussels, and wad of orange trout roe — didn't it deserve to be called seafood chowder? The soup arrived dry but was dramatically finished with an arc of creamy broth poured from a teapot, one of several tableside flourishes. A close second was the rare but crisp-skinned duck breast, three miniature slices that rolled in rather comically on an undercarriage of four small brussels sprouts. Also deserving of praise was the beet ravioli, finger-size half-moons in a buttery chive sauce. On the vegetable menu, best was a bowl of farro papardelle with assorted veggies and ‘shrooms."", 'The least desirable course was a lobster salad that comprised two very small cubes of lobster meat with a delicate carrot julienne, a shmear of orange squash, and a couple of tiny mushroom caps. It seems sad that a salad can no longer resemble a salad, at least at this level of the food culture. Foams were incorporated into several courses in a nod to science chefdom, and both menus collectively looked like a gallery of Lilliputian abstract paintings, like a stroll through a miniature MOMA circa 1965.', 'Above: Flowers in the Tavern Room; Below: Fluke tartare and Jerk pork chop', 'The following Monday evening we arrived at 6:30 and presented ourselves in the front barroom, hoping to avoid the crowds. We were seated almost immediately at a two-top in a dramatic pool of light. It felt like being on stage. Periodically, the wood-burning oven, overhung with copper pots, flamed up as dishes on peels were thrust inside.

Standing in for the lamb sandwich of yore was a lamb flatbread ($14) singed in the oven, dotted with potato chunks and smothered in baby arugula. It was exquisite, and readily fell into shareable squares. Compared with the celeriac chowder encountered four days earlier, the kuri squash chowder was much livelier, its orange broth buoying lots of shrimp and sea bass flavored with caramelized onions and scallions, an unusual allium combination. The jerk pork chop ($24) was an inspired piece of meat, though the classic jerk flavorings had been abstracted: the allspice at a low hum, while the pickled habaneros shouted. Sadly, the pork chop was devoid of any accompanying starches.', 'There were missteps in the front room, too. A cassoulet stinted on the beans, and the sausage and pork belly never really assimilated themselves into the kind of gluey, crumb-topped mass one expects from this Gascon specialty. However, the meal ended agreeably with a dessert called Dutch baby, an early American recipe reverently recreated by pastry chef Miro Uskokovic.', 'The real drawback of the tasting menus is where you physically eat them — in the stodgy, old world back room. The tavern room, by contrast, is as sleek as any modern venue, with giant windows, a fire-breathing wood oven, and Robert Kushner’s famed ""Cornucopia"" mural, an avant-garde ode to produce.', 'Why not ignore the increasingly irrelevant distinctions between refinement and rusticity?', ""But is the tavern menu, where everything’s listed at $24 or under, any less ambitious or delicious than the formal dining room fare? Not really. Fluke tartare, with its firm flesh and bright cilantro, packed flavors that were nearly on par with the tasting menu's Peconic Bay scallops. Kuri squash soup, with ruby red shrimp exhibiting the soft texture of more expensive langoustines, didn’t posses any less depth than the dining room’s fancier seafood chowder. And a coriander-studded duck sausage with creamy yellow-eyed beans made for such a nimble cassoulet one could serve it in the dead of summer at Daniel and no one would be any worse off."", 'So why not ignore the increasingly irrelevant distinctions between refinement and rusticity, between ""reservation food"" and ""walk-in food,"" and offer every option, everywhere, throughout the two dining rooms? Bar diners deserve tasting menus just as much as back room diners deserve an a la carte option during dinner service.']"
277,"['Last year one of my favorite restaurants was Bhojan, a Curry Hill newcomer that peddled vegetarian Guajarati cuisine from India\'s wild wild west. It was an outpost of the empire of Indian dining impresario and B-list Bollywood actor Shiva Natarajan, whose other holdings in the city include Chola, Dhaba, Malai Marke, and Chote Nawab — oddly named after a 1961 movie nobody seems to like. But Natarajan has done more to popularize the regional cuisines of his native land than anyone before him, and has also been instrumental in remaking the restaurant scene on lower Lexington Avenue, nicknamed ""Curry Hill"" since the 1980s. The food at his establishments — at slightly elevated prices — is frequently excellent.', 'Which is why I was disappointed when Bhojan shuttered just as it was gaining traction, and Natarajan replaced it with Haldi, specializing in the food of Calcutta and Bengal. Sprinkled throughout the menu are a small collection of Jewish-Indian delicacies, real critic bait. I was there in a flash. The Indian-Jewish stuff proved OK, though lacking in nuance, but when I brought a Bengali friend to sample the food he\'d grown up with, he wrinkled up his nose and exclaimed, ""The curries are well-prepared and wholesome, but the place has got the spicing scheme all wrong!"" And I had to agree: the food tasted way more Punjabi than Bengali, with a dearth of mustard oil and too many entrees awash in brown gravy.', ""Accordingly I did what critics must sometimes do and abandoned the project just as I was about to pay my third visit. Instead, I took a chance and dragged myself and my friends to another Natarajan restaurant a few doors down, Kokum. We found an interior decorated with hanging basket lamps and a mural of the high-prowed and brightly painted fishing boats of Kerala, India's southernmost state. The dining room was deep and narrow, with rows of tables along both walls. A bar at the end of the room dispensed beer, wine, and cocktails. Skip the awful cocktails, but do hoist a Kingfisher Beer — Indian suds with a touch of sourness, now being brewed in Saratoga Springs, just north of Albany."", 'Kokum features the food of South India, which is gradually taking over menus in Curry Hill.', 'Kokum features the food of South India, which is gradually taking over menus in Curry Hill. Not just the dosas, iddlies, and uttapams that were the harbingers of this fascinating collection of cuisines over a decade ago, but the meat, seafood, and chicken-bearing aspects of the cooking of Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states, including that of the cities of Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, and Mangalore.

Another dish featuring the same red fruit is Nadan fish curry ($18), name-checking a 2013 film set in Kerala featuring an old-fashioned dramatic troupe on the skids. You'll need an Indian-film expert to ferret out all the obscure cinematic references on a Shiva Natarajan menu — though this particular dish turns out to be a plainish collection of tilapia chunks in a tart red sauce that is somewhat disappointing."", ""One surprising feature of the new wave of south Indian restaurants in Curry Hill is their habit of thrusting chicken eggs into the spotlight, and Kokum is no exception. Egg roast ($8.95) is one of the most agreeable apps; boiled specimens halved and heaped with spicy onions, seeming like a worthwhile spin on deviled eggs. Eggs occur in stealthier fashion in egg dosa, a crepe featuring the usual potato filling. But when you cut into it you'll find an egg annealed to the inside of the pancake. In likewise fashion, eggs appear as the star of the show in a biryani; scrambled with tomatoes, chiles, and torn-up flatbread in egg kothu paratha (like some mutant bread pudding); and most spectacularly in egg appam, bowl-shaped breads, each with a runny fried egg at the bottom, sided with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry."", ""No matter how many times you visit Kokum, you're likely to stumble on something you'll fall in love with."", ""In south Indian cuisines, one also finds many curries thickened with coconut milk as well as lots of homely vegetarian dishes featuring mixtures of rice, lentils, and vegetables.

In bisi bela Houliana, a recipe from Bangalore, rice is stewed with all sorts of vegetables, and made tart with tamarind pulp. The dish is usually named bis bela bath — who knows why Natarajan tacked an Irish-sounding name on the end?"", ""Ultimately, though the menu often reads like some extended joke that we can't quite understand, the food is often spectacular. The menu boasts around 125 choices, and no matter how many times you visit Kokum, you're likely to stumble on something you'll fall in love with before you reach the bottom of the serving bowl.

Later that decade, the chef broke out on his own at Danny Meyer's now-closed Tabla, a fantastic Indian spot with seasonal American sensibilities, and then at Meyer's North End Grill, a high-end brasserie with gentler South Asian inclinations.

It coincided with the rise of celebrity-chef restaurants in Vegas, and a trip out to its Eastside shopping mall setting became a critical stop on a food pilgrim’s dining romp. Back then, eating Lotus’s northern Thai specialties like Issan fermented sausage and sweet, garlicky pork stew were absolute revelations, like the first time eating risotto Milanese when you thought all Italian food came smothered in tomato sauce.', 'Fifteen years later, serious-minded Thai food is finally percolating across the U.S. Andy Ricker enticed the masses with rigorously researched recipes\xa0at Pok Pok and his subsequent restaurants in Portland and New York.

People waited for tables in the tiny foyer and on the sidewalk, and servers were pushing bodies through the restaurant as fast as possible. The Issan sausage still rang with ginger, and the dusky sour-sweetness of thum ka noon (pounded jackfruit with ground pork) satisfied, as did deep-fried catfish set ablaze with red curry paste.

But the output from the kitchen at newcomer\xa0Chada Thai & Wine over in Chinatown definitely came off as more energized. Bank Atchawaran, a former manager at Lotus of Siam, opened Chada in fall 2012, and to his credit it feels nothing like a Lotus knockoff. The neutral-toned dining room is small and dim, and the menu leans to Southern Thai dishes, often with a softer, more tropical flavor profile. In a dish called sen mee kang pou, lumps of crabmeat lulled in perfumed coconut milk, with knots of vermicelli rice noodles to help capture the sauce. It wasn’t all gentle: A pungent fermented fish curry with bamboo shoots, Thai eggplants, and other vegetables jangled my sinuses. The one cue Atchawaran took from Lotus was to build out a stellar wine list, not as encyclopedic on German varietals as his former employers but impressive in its Old World scope.', 'A caveat: My dinner at Chada is one of those meals I remember more fondly in hindsight. Our waiter seemed impatient with questions and disappeared for long stretches. As the evening went on and the dining room filled, it was only him and another server tending to the room; he did his best to avoid even looking our way. Twenty minutes after we’d finished our meal, I finally had to stand by the kitchen door to ask him for a check, which didn’t come for another ten minutes.

281,"['Beyond its essence as a garlicky bean and meat stew with a breadcrumb cap, the ""Midwestern Cassoulet"" served at Heartland in St. Paul is a go-with-the-flow recipe. Its contents change daily depending on what arrives in the restaurant\'s butchery department and market. Paula Foreman, who runs nearby Encore Farms, delivers variations on white beans (recently it was the speckled bird\'s-eye variety) in fifty-pound batches to Heartland\'s chef-owner Lenny Russo. In the dish\'s combination of animal proteins, Russo looks for balance: a sausage, a smoked addition, something with an especially lush texture. A form of pork is always present, but numerous cuts of lamb, goat, beef, elk, and rabbit also make it into rotation. Russo calls it ""the Noah\'s Ark of cassoulets.""', ""The approach strays from the traditional variants in France's Languedoc region, where the dish originated, but it was still the most satisfying version I've ever had in an American restaurant. The crust (panko flecked with parsley and glossed with duck fat) gave intermittent crackle to the sumptuous, motley ragout underneath. Approaching the cassoulet with flexibility gives it staying power as one of the few regular items on Heartland's always-evolving menu."", 'Above: Midwestern cassoulet; Left: Smoked kielbasa corn dog; Right: Veal chop with braised kale and fingerling potatoes', ""Russo opened the restaurant in 2002 after cooking in the Twin Cities for over a decade.

He relocated Heartland a decade later to its current address — a vast space in St. Paul's Lowertown warehouse district shrewdly broken into fetching sections, including a dining room lined with brick and reclaimed woods, an expansive lounge area anchored by a bar underneath a floating red ceiling, and the Farm Direct Market that sells the same meats and vegetables the cooks use to prepare dinner."", ""Russo goes the locavore distance: Around 90 percent of the food at Heartland comes from within a 300-mile radius. But there's nothing fussy or self-satisfied about the experience. In a nod to the forthcoming ballpark being built close to the restaurant, the substantial bar menu includes four burgers (beef, pork, veal, and bison) and fun, smart riffs on snacks like smoked kielbasa corndogs or cheese curds with apricot ketchup. In the main room, entrees dole out bear hugs of direct, honest flavors: rainbow trout over wild rice in green tomato broth, a rosy veal chop with braised kale and fingerling potatoes atop toasted pumpkin seed puree. Russo's devotion to culinary Minnesota is evident in every forkful."", 'While Heartland embodies the largesse of Midwest cooking and hospitality, Piccolo celebrates local bounty through the diminutive.

Then there was Flicker\'s luxury-loving side: loosely scrambled eggs gilded with pickled pig\'s feet morsels, truffle butter, and a stack of petals made from Parmigiano-Reggiano; rabbit tortellini in peppery nasturtium butter, dotted with hazelnuts and goat cheese. His all-in experimenter traits showed with a disc of orangey monkfish liver mousse. It formed the perimeter that held a quenelle of celeriac ""tartare,"" a silky wisp of cured Arctic char, and crisped salmon skin that resembled the rudder-like gnomon on a sundial.

His is not a hubcap-size gut buster, but it is impressively correct: turkey or veal (I prefer the latter) pounded to a slip and encased by — but not clinging to — sheer, rippling batter. It needs nothing else yet nonetheless benefits from sides of mustard-zinged potato salad; creamy, dill-laced tangles of cucumbers; and chunky lingonberry sauce.

Of course there are more overtly genial dishes — like a classic beef tartare or a playful dish of rabbit leg, ham, and sausage with carrots in various guises — but diners have embraced his experimental nature. It also helps that the staff tackles smart cocktails, craft beers, and offbeat wines with equal confidence. And that the space looks like a barn overrun by hipsters, with twinkly chandeliers among a hodgepodge of woods and wall-filling paintings of animals in wild primary colors. Hear the twelve-string guitar pounding overhead? It's likely The Replacements; one of the songs from their album Hootenanny inspired the restaurant's name.

Other curry choices include pork, fish, chicken, and beef, though the fish is often not available. I'm often found sitting on the fence about Indian-Chinese food, but here the canon is simply and delightfully rendered. The vegetable chow mein ($6) proved one of the best things on the menu, ropey wheat noodles sluiced with thick soy sauce and tossed with cabbage, red sweet peppers, and enough chiles to make your mouth burn. The Indian-Chinese classic lollipop wings, in which the flesh is pushed to the top of the bone like a little umbrella, lacks the usual cloying red sauce and is instead breaded and cooked like Southern fried chicken.

290,"['The only reason Ratchanee Sumpatboon\'s name hasn\'t become more familiar may be the difficulty of pronouncing it. She\'s the chef who pioneered Isan food in Queens, first at Chao Thai, then at Poodam — it means ""black crab,"" which was her childhood nickname. ""I was short and dark-skinned,"" she once confided, ""so my family and friends called me Poodam."" Sumpatboon next brought Isan food to Manhattan, initially at Zabb Elee in the East Village and later at her own place in Hell\'s Kitchen called Larb Ubol. Now, one year later, this ambitious and talented chef has just opened another pair of restaurants, both named Lan Larb. One is east of Soho on Centre Street, the other on First Avenue in Kip\'s Bay.', 'The menu at Lan Larb Soho overlaps that of its forerunner Larb Ubol by about 80 percent, but the food tends to be arranged on the plate with more attention to appearance — long a feature of Manhattan Thai dining establishments — and the entrees average a dollar or two more apiece. Outfitted with ethnographic objects in little niches and an up-to-date lighting scheme, Lan Larb Soho feels like a typical neighborhood Thai restaurant. It offers crowd-pleasing curries from southern Thailand that Larb Ubol ignore, as well as dishes included merely for their trashy familiarity, such as fried calamari and chicken wings with a sweet dipping sauce. Health enthusiasts will relish the vegetarian spring rolls and steamed vegetable dumplings.', 'Larb ped', ""But the balance of the menu concentrates mainly on the food of Isan, Thailand's impoverished northeastern region across the Mekong River from Laos and Cambodia, where sharp flavors like fish sauce, hot chiles, tamarind, lime juice, kaffir lime, and coriander abound, minus the mellowing influence of coconut milk. In particular Lan Larb explores the interplay of Laotian and Siamese cuisines in a way unseen before in New York City via a series of unique dishes."", 'Lan Larb explores the interplay of Laotian and Siamese cuisines in a way unseen before in New York City.', ""One such dish is Lao chicken soup ($10), a sizable tureen that deposits the unusual combo of fresh chicken and pickled fish in a tart brown tamarind broth. Dredge around and find shredded green papaya, tangling tendrils of water spinach, firm long-beans, and Thai eggplants, which look for all the world like tiny watermelons. A perfumed odor wafts up from the bowl as the soup is served. Isaan strikes back with a seafood soup ($15) also based on tamarind broth, flavored with fish sauce, basil, lemongrass, and jaew — a fiery ground-spice mixture that explodes with umami. Jaew is just one of the surprises that lurks around every corner of Lan Larb's menu."", 'The heart of the bill of fare are the ground-meat salads called larbs (alternatively known as laaps, larps, or lahbs, according to a footnote on the menu). While most Thais in town offer pedestrian chicken and pork versions, here there are eight, of which the best is made with duck ($11). It incorporates little tidbits of skin among micro-nuggets of the feathered creature, conferring a welcome crispness. Back in Isan, the salad would be dressed with duck blood, which may be a little more funk than Soho could stand.', 'Above: Pad kee mao and Larb pla krapong; Below: Sai krog isan', ""The catfish version is also worth ordering, utilizing a sun-dried form of the fish broken up into chewy shreds redolent of a muddy and lazy river. Another version, and one not offered at Larb Ubol, is larb nam-tok nuer, featuring beef that's been grilled in strips rather than merely ground and steamed, and hence retains more meaty savor. Any larb comes accompanied by cabbage and cucumbers; one way to eat these larbs is by piling bitefuls on the veggies. Sumpatboon offers competing renditions of som tum, too, the famous shredded green papaya salad prepared with a mortar and pestle, which more effectively releases the aromatic flavors than, say, a food processor. The Laotian version of the papaya salad adds raw crab and pickled fish, while the Isaan one deploys dried shrimp."", 'It will be like a flamethrower in your mouth', 'While Larb Ubol pointedly ignores curries entirely, Lan Larb offers them out of necessity, given the broad range of expectations for Thai food on the part of its patrons. While the green curry is predictably humdrum, the massaman curry of beef and potatoes is a paragon of unspicy mellowness, suggesting you should order it if only to staunch the extreme burn of the Isan fare. By the way, there is an exception to the ""curries tend to be bland"" rule at Lan Larb Soho. It\'s called jungle curry (with mock duck, $12), and you should order it with some caution. If you request it at the top of its potential hotness — the waitress is likely to offer you a four or five point spiciness scale — it will be like a flamethrower aimed at your mouth.

From his rookie panic and resolve for success came creations like rice cakes in chile sauce with caramelized onions and—they need no introduction—steamed Chinese buns swabbed with hoisin and folded around pork belly squares with scallions and cucumber. Within a year the restaurant would be a phenomenon. Chang’s style merged cultures and dining formats in fresh ways. His bar with the plywood wall that bent the mind serving such sophisticated flavors? It helped to strike a crack in upscale formality that spread until the genre shattered.', 'Shrimp bun; Pork belly buns', 'A decade of fetishism and imitation later, I’m so sick of pork belly buns that my vision blurs when they appear on menus. I only want to eat them at Noodle Bar to savor their archetypal rightness: the airy squish to the bun, the ratio of dense meat and tremulous fat, the sweet sauce colliding with oniony sharpness and clean-tasting cucumber. Order a bunch of dishes and the buns often arrive first. Nothing compares to the original but other persuasive variations entice, including an oily-crisp shrimp cake with spicy mayo, pickled red onions (sometimes they’re shallots) and shredded iceberg lettuce.', 'Last month the restaurant served a weeklong menu celebrating its tenth anniversary, lugging out some beloved recipes from previous head chefs. Garlicky smoked chicken wings were worth returning to the rotation, as was a witty riff on caprese salad with tofu masquerading as mozzarella and pungent shiso subbing for basil. The chile-slaked rice cakes with their jammy onions made a triumphant return, too.', 'Noodle bowls (clockwise from center): chicken and egg with rice, ginger scallion noodles, Momofuku ramen', 'Noodle bowls came last, the de facto entrees. Chang also spurred the ramen wildfire that continues to rage across New York and the rest of the country. Other ramen efforts in the city surpass Noodle Bar these days, but don’t discount the contentment this bowl still delivers. The egg’s yolk enriches and smooths the broth, and the bevy of textures (frilly shoulder, firm belly, pleasantly spongy fish cake, the yielding noodles) ensures that every spoonful is varied. Share another bowl with an eye out for contrast, like the zingy ginger-scallion noodles topped with shiitakes and the cucumbers that the kitchen quick-cures with sugar and salt.', 'For anniversary week, the restaurant served just one dessert—a peaches-and-cream cookie that references both pastry chef Christina Tosi’s popular blueberries-and-cream cookie and the company’s slogan, ""Momofuku means Lucky Peach.""

292,"[""\n  Long before there was a Faviken, a Relae, or even a Noma, many refined gastronauts came to appreciate Nordic food in a very different way than we understand it today thanks to a groundbreaking restaurant called Aquavit. No, not all culinary institutions age gracefully; just making it to a decade is a triumph. And so that's why I'm happy to report that 27 years after it opened, Hakan Swahn's Manhattan establishment still kicks ass, with a new chef, Emma Bengtsson, who turns out to be a serious gastronomic force to be reckoned with. And really, who could doubt a restaurant named after Swedish vodka?\n  "", ""Icy shots (I repeat, shots) of that alcoholic beverage still flow freely here — when was the last time you had shots at Per Se? The caraway and fennel-infused spirit is precisely what to drink with Bengtsson's scallop and sea urchin, a duo of crustaceans that tastes right and relevant even if there's nothing new about this pairing. The diver scallop, one-dimensional and cloying elsewhere, exhibits a powerful brininess here, with a hint of sugar from the Maine urchin and a lick of acidity from a pungent vinaigrette. The whole affair, colored in swaths of green, red, white, and orange, ends up looking like a psychedelic tidal pool somewhere in the North Atlantic, a magical place where the ocean tastes like good balsamic."", 'Top: Place setting; Left: Sweetbreads with compressed blue cheese foan; Right: Torched langostines with hay-smoked oysters.

That makes her the second woman in America, after Dominique Crenn, to receive that accolade."", 'She\'s not the first chef to make a name for herself at Aquavit. The Midtown mainstay, which opened in 1987 at a Rockefeller townhouse on 54th St., garnered national acclaim in the 1990s under the auspicious reign of chef Marcus Samuelsson, an Ethiopian-born Swede whose ""New Scandinavian Cuisine,"" took a global view of Northern European fare, an approach that resulted in one of the most memorable meals of my life in 2003. I remember Kumamoto oysters with curry mango sorbet, cured salmon with tandoori spices, smoked arctic char in a Japanese-like mushroom consomme, and on a later visit, foie gras lava cake.', ""But now, at the 55th St. digs (Aquavit relocated in 2005), we get a different approach to Scandinavia. There's crispy cod skin with bleak roe, fragrant rye crisps with fennel seeds, and bacon-topped pig's blood cakes — the flavor of boudin noir times five."", 'Gravlax with smoke and roe', 'Bengtsson, who was previously pastry chef at Aquavit, is continuing the good work of her predecessor, Marcus Jernmark, in producing fare that\'s leaner, more focused, and more Swedish than Samuelsson\'s. Her cooking is a happy midpoint between classic European cuisine and the strongly indigenous ""no olive oil let\'s use sea buckthorn"" New Nordic ethos espoused by Noma\'s René Redzepi. That means no tandoori spices on Bengtsson\'s chopped gravlax, just a classic hay smoke (for a hint of sweetness), and a garnish of roe (for textural pop and a clean punch of oil). It\'s nothing groundbreaking. It\'s just perfect.', ""There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York."", ""Is Aquavit's food as exciting and compelling as the offerings at Atelier Crenn, Atera, Blanca, Elizabeth, Annisa, the late Aska, or Manresa? Not necessarily, and perhaps that's where Michelin and this critic would disagree. Aquavit's pedestrian, 5 - 6oz lamb chop has no place on an ambitious tasting. And while brined cod with fried anchovy is straight up FlavorTown, the 4oz portion, on the same menu as the lamb, is another gut buster. That's up to ten ounces of protein in two consecutive courses. Not cool. But still. There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York. The price is right too, with a five-course menu at $95, and an eight-course tasting at $135. Order the longer menu, as that's the only way to sample the epic sweetbread preparation. The duck-fat cooked organs are wrapped in compressed fuji apples and topped with a blue cheese foam — an accidental fondue course. Another highlight: barley risotto with summer truffles, as a rich, earthy, al dente porridge."", 'Heirloom tomatoes with horseradish snow', ""And for those who haven't dropped by Aquavit in a while, note that the former dining room, a windowless affair that evoked an executive lounge in Corporate Purgatory, is now reserved for private events. Guests now enjoy their three-hour tastings up front in the old bistro room, an airier space overlooking 55th Street. Smart move."", ""Another bonus: Should you bring a pocketbook or backpack into the dining room, the wait staff will provide a raccoon fur-covered stool for it to rest upon. It's the type of adornment one might expect for a restaurant that smells like a campfire, which this one does, thanks to a ubiquitous (albeit judicious) use of smoke throughout the meal, perfuming striped bass (good), leek and potato soup (very good) and Swiss chard-wrapped duck leg (even better)."", ""That duck leg, incidentally, plays a supporting role to a breast boasting such densely crispy skin that I'm halfway tempted to call it the new archetype for this dish throughout the city. And amping up the iron-y funk are tiny bits of crispy duck skin scattered throughout the plate. Cleanse the palate with chili mango aquavit and the evening starts to take on a warm glow."", 'Arctic Nest; Petit fours', 'The evening improves further with the arrival of the Arctic Nest, a naturalistic riff on the classic Aquavit dessert. In the past guests were served a cylinder of goat fromage parfait topped with blueberry sorbet and a swooping honey tuile. It looked like a modernist sculpture in an overpriced Danish design store. Bengtsson, in turn, has reimagined that delicacy as a goat cheese egg, filled with a ""sea buckthorn"" yolk and all nestled in a tangle of tuiles shaped to resemble a proper avian abode. The tart-sweet-crunchy combo is as good as ever, and so is Aquavit. Finish off with pate de fruit flavored like ""Sour Patch Kids"" and raise a glass to Hakan Swahn for continuing to make his restaurant a breeding ground for important New York chefs.']"

Earlier this year Hugh Acheson debuted The Florence in Savannah, where trout comes with rice grits and salmoriglio (Southern Italy's answer to pesto) and tagliatelle entangles pork belly and burrata.

Toasted slices act as crostini for punchy dry-aged beef tartare, angled over a pool of salsa verde.

But what if a chef chose to meld ingredients and techniques that work together, putting two hemispheres on a level playing field, favoring neither one nor the other but treating each as a grab bag from which elements, judged solely on their compatibility, are drawn? Such is the case with Tuome.\n  "", ""The premises on a dead-end block of 5th Street in the East Village has been a revolving door for restaurants over the years. Notoriously, it was Le Gamin, a French joint of no particular merit, then Kuboya Ramen, a meritorious noodle shack that never found its constituency — mainly because a beloved ramen-ya was already next door. The double storefront has been spruced up with (what else?) Edison light bulbs and bare brick, and to adumbrate this last detail, distressed white window frames have been hung in front of sections of brick wall — which is probably the view you already enjoy from your tenement apartment. Industrial spools have been painstakingly hung on one wall like organ pipes, but the entire effect of the décor is nil. Which is fine, since décor is not the point: The food is shockingly excellent, and I didn't find single dud among the dishes."", 'Beets with quinoa and five spice yogurt.

It sits on a gravel of pork x.o., the ""x.o."" designating a spicy seafood sauce that originated in Hong Kong, here turned illiquid, as financiers might say. As the dish arrives, the chef does as well, wielding the kind of device used at college parties to dispense whippets of nitrous oxide.

295,"[""\n  The Mansion on Turtle Creek, as it is known informally, has always been more to the Dallas dining community than a swank hotel with a fancy restaurant. Once the home of a cotton tycoon, the Italian Renaissance-style property welcomed the public in 1980 and directly established itself as a playground for socialites and billionaires at a time when the city was drenched in oil money. The reputation cemented. Even at a time when fine dining is downscaling (and Dallas' trend toward casual took root later than in most cities) the Mansion remains synonymous with occasion and indulgence.\n  "", ""Much of that has to do with the restaurant's reputation for doting service (particularly enjoyed by regulars) and with the three unusually gifted chefs who led the kitchen over the last thirty years. Dean Fearing came on as executive chef in 1984, catapulting the restaurant's fame. He worked the dining room in his chef's whites and cowboy boots while pushing forward the era's Southwestern cuisine craze with luxurious tortilla soup and lobster tacos. He stayed for 21 years, sometimes veering into rococo fusion flings (imagine fried quail surrounded by pot stickers, egg salad, and gingered rice salad) before leaving in 2006 to open Fearing's, with its four stunning themed rooms, in the Ritz-Carlton Dallas."", ""A quest to replace Fearing brought outspoken chef John Tesar to the city. He expelled the Southwestern shtick in favor of broader New American extravagances. I gave his cooking five stars during my tenure as dining critic at the Dallas Morning News: I still daydream about a lobe of foie gras impaled with a vanilla bean, its tiny black seeds trailing off into an apple puree underneath. Tesar moved on in early 2009 (he currently operates two Dallas restaurants, Spoon and Knife); Bruno Davaillon, previously at Alain Ducasse's Mix at the Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, replaced him nine months later. Davaillon hails from the Touraine area of France's Loire Valley. He isn't an extrovert like his predecessors and stays close to the stoves. But he has the same degree of virtuoso talent."", 'Cauliflower panna cotta with caviar and daikon gelee', 'The Mansion has strived to remain relevant to changing tastes: a multimillion-dollar renovation last decade toned down the space\'s formality with modern art and slick leather chairs.

I understand the urge to reach a larger audience, but I come to a place like the Mansion expecting to bask in throwback grandeur. The kitchen offers an a la carte menu, but when most appetizers are priced over $20 and mains cost $38 to $59, you might as well go for one of four five-course tasting menus themed to vegetables ($85), seafood ($95), and meat ($105), or the ""gourmand"" ($115) that covers the protein gamut. The staff might even nudge the kitchen to mix and match dishes from different menus on the diners\' behalf.', ""My first meal at the Mansion since I left Dallas (and my first time trying Davaillon's creations) began with a Belon oyster, its shell also filled with chopped Texas wagyu tartare, smoked cream, lemon zest, and a shower of crunchy red quinoa. It mixed French and Lone Star State aesthetics and hinted at the exotic. It telegraphed Davaillon's headspace as a chef: His imagination meanders but his technique is classical and micro-detailed. The sculptured courses that came next traveled the world of flavors, but the kitchen's precision gave the meal a cohesive arch. Dashi broth and gelee, cubed daikon, and a sprinkling of buckwheat offset the richness of cauliflower panna cotta and caviar. Pastrami, wilted Savoy cabbage, mustard cream airlifted hunks of supple monkfish to Bucharest. Cilantro-crusted lamb evoked North Africa, with its sides of merguez (cleverly stuffed and braised in a cylinder made of kohlrabi) and minted yogurt."", 'Above: Belon oyster with wagyu tartare, smoked cream, and red quinoa; Left: Cilantro-crusted lamb with merguez, kohlrabi, and minted yogurt; Right: Hibiscus-poached apple with lemon pound cake and apple sorbet', ""Straight-up modern American pleasures landed on the table as well: a silky sweetbread raviolo over autumnal chestnut puree; an equally seasonal stunner from pastry chef Nicolas Blouin of apple spheres poached in hibiscus syrup (at first glance they resembled raspberries) with lemon pound cake, almond granola, and bracing green apple sorbet crowned a pretty apple chip. It was one of those dinners where trust in the chef's gifts instantly took hold, where my friend and I simply relaxed into the experience. I had to hunt for criticisms. There was really only one: the curry in a piquillo pepper marmalade came on too strong alongside delicate king crab meat wrapped in avocado cannelloni-style."", ""Servers may be more casually dressed but they remain as pampering as ever. In their knowledge of the cooking, one can sense unusually strong communication between the kitchen and the dining room. Newly arrived sommelier Jennifer Eby, whose ebullience will fit right in with the staff, poured elegant French whites throughout the evening.

He constructed the restaurant on a cliff overlooking Lake Union; the building's jaunty angles mirror juts of land across the watery expanse. The view is remarkable even on a drizzly evening, when the city lights in the distance create a twinkly haze through the mist. Stone columns, cedar beams, and discrete fixtures that filter down marigold light give the room ageless warmth. Canlis is still, hands down, one of America's most romantic destinations.\n  "", 'The service matches the atmosphere. A hostess showed my friend and me to a table right in front of the picture windows. My first thought was, ""How did we score this?"" (And, no, it wasn\'t because I was made as a critic; I\'m quite sure I escaped notice.) But nearly every party in the restaurant enjoyed an exquisite sightline. Couples sat side-by-side against a nearby banquet and on the tier above us, facing out toward the spectacle.

Last decade, brothers Brian and Mark Canlis began taking over day-to-day operations from their parents, Chris and Alice, who ran the business after patriarch Peter Canlis passed away in 1977. The siblings brought aboard Jason Franey as executive chef in 2008. Franey worked as Daniel Humm's sous chef at Manhattan's Eleven Madison Park, and the Canlises intended him to push the menu in more progressive directions. But it's always dicey to mess with a formula rooted in multigenerational traditions."", 'Photo provided by Canlis', ""Dinner skewed tame. We had the choice of ordering three- or four-course meals with options in every category (starters, entrees, desserts), or a set seven-course chef's tasting menu that required both of us to order it. In hindsight, the tasting menu—with dishes that night like matsutake mushrooms with chicken liver mousse, Sauternes, and purslane—would have likely delivered more modernism. The regular menu read docile and familiar: heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella, watermelon, and arugula; butternut squash with brown butter and sage; lamb with potato rösti and carrots. Continental classics filled out the offerings, and I have a soft spot for well-executed vintage dishes, so we largely charged ahead on that path."", 'Our server trundled over a cart to prepare a salad tableside: She tossed romaine in a wooden bowl with bacon, cherry tomatoes, scallions, and grated cheese in a lemony olive oil-egg dressing. Fresh mint added a distinctive glint to this Americana charmer. Prawns splayed in a tidy row were dappled with a sauce of vermouth, lime, and a whisper of garlic. Wagyu New York strip delivered plenty of char and sanguine savor. We ordered its faithful chophouse companion alongside: twice-baked mashed potatoes, fluffy with sour cream and riddled with more bacon. This was Continental without the theatrical frisson\xa0of a place like La Grenouille, but it was a spread that my four-year-old nephew or my 88-year-old grandmother would equally appreciate. At a standard-bearer for celebrations, approachability counts.', ""The benchmarks impressed more than two modish savories: overcooked halibut in a wan tomato fondue and pork cheek lolling in a tangy, one-note corn puree. Given the broad appeal, would it be out of place for at least a couple of dishes on the basic menu to surprise the more jaded palates among the clientele? Would it be too outré for the kitchen to explore a recipe or two that harkens to the Canlis family's Greek heritage?"", ""Dessert sparked the meal's most striking pyrotechnics. The pastry team, led by Baruch Ellsworth, furnished a billowy Grand Marnier soufflé, textbook down to the crème anglaise on the side. But a reimagined mille-feuille also brought the wow factor: It was more akin to a candy bar with creamy layers of vanilla, milk chocolate, and banana, surrounded by fillips like crumbled cookie and roasted banana ice cream. Its many elements coalesced. We were comforted but also energized by the creativity. For a fine dining survivor to remain current, more of the meal should make us feel as engaged.""]"

Inside was the odd protein combination of ground pork and shrimp and masses of steaming beansprouts. It was delicious, a definition of mellowness. ""This giant version is a city thing. In the Vietnamese countryside the pancakes are much smaller. In Hanoi we also put green beans in them,"" she explained, ""so this version is certainly southern.""', 'Left: banh xeo Right: banh hoi thit heo nurong', 'Next up was banh hoi, forming an entire class of assemble-it-yourself dishes.

Striped from the grill and smoky tasting, the pork glistened with sautéed scallions; crushed peanuts were heaped on top. Alongside came fresh basil, lime wedges, lettuce leaves, and pickled daikon and carrot. The idea is to select combinations of ingredients and wrap them up inside the leaves, then dip them in the fishy vinegar called nouc cham, goosed up with hot chiles or hoisin at your discretion. As Mai delightedly pointed out, ""This is something that is served at weddings."" Indeed, the process of assembling and eating banh hoi tends to make you feel happy and talkative.', 'The broth contains sliced beef, pig knuckles, and congealed pig blood.', 'Her third selection was surprising, not one of the myriad versions of pho that occupy one entire side of the menu, but bun bo hue, a meal-size soup from the central Vietnamese city of Hue (pronounced ""Way""). Based on a long-boiled beef broth, the flavor is ramped up with lemongrass and chili oil, and the broth contains sliced beef, pig knuckles, and congealed pig blood, which resembles wobbly cubes of Jell-O. Don\'t worry, it won\'t turn you into a vampire. The rice noodles are thicker and looser than pho, so light you can have a mouthful and almost not be aware of it. Toss in the accompanying herbs and sprouts. There have been richer and better versions of this soup in New York City, nevertheless this one was tasty and — according to Mai — relatively authentic.', 'Pho', 'In three subsequent visits with different groups of Vietnamese food fans, much of the menu was explored with a particular emphasis on rarely seen dishes. Bot chien ($6.50) is a delicious heap of starchy, boxcar-shaped rice cakes scrambled with eggs — it would make an excellent brunch, if the city\'s mimosa mills only knew about it. ""So nuoc dua"" is a lovely ceramic bowl of gargantuan two-bite mussels immersed in a thick coconut-milk curry, which glistens a dreamy shade of green. One of the most expensive things on the menu is ca luoi trau chien don ($24.95), a beautifully fried whole flounder — many of the small bones are edible — with a cup of ""Vietnamese sauce"" on the side: deep red, sweet and sour, and laced with finely chopped shallots.

From among two dozen permutations, one is well advised to order the deluxe xe lua ($7.25), which contains the full catalog of beef additions in a complex broth with cinnamon and star anise accents. What does ""xe lua"" mean? I asked my Vietnamese friend on that first visit. ""It means ‘fire car,\'"" she explained with a smile.

Nashville, though, does have dibs on the genre known as hot chicken. Sure, a flicker of pepper or chile may be a standard part of most recipes. Gus’s fried chicken in Memphis famously swats the taste buds with a cayenne backhand. But Nashville hot chicken is something else altogether. The final product comes doused in a shellac of lava capsicum (often laced with lard), turning it a deeper, scarier crimson than Buffalo wings could ever hope to achieve.\n  ', 'These days the Nashville metro area is littered with hot chicken joints, each closely guarding their spice blends and fiery additions.

It seems Thornton was fond of the ladies, and after staying out too late one Saturday night he came home in the morning to find his girlfriend preparing the traditional Sunday chicken.

My mouth thrummed, but it didn’t set off alarms. The hot, however, took it to the edge. First there was a fleeting ""no big deal"" reaction: The spices felt gritty-dusty against the tongue, and I registered the skin’s crispness, the vegetal flavor of the chiles, and the juicy flesh underneath.

And now, nearly a decade later, Cherche Midi’s careful cooking ranks as among the best of the McNally bunch. So get cozy on a ""Balthazar Red"" booth and tuck into a pot of cheese, a silky ramekin of parmesan custard that’s flanked by fishy anchovy toast soldiers for omega-3 bliss. The correct pairing is a lemony glass of Lenoble Champagne, which, at $20, isn’t too shabby.', 'How about beef tartare? The classic preparation bursts with notes of garlic, olive oil, and Tabasco. Pro diners will scoop up the raw filet with a side of pommes soufflées, a fried tuber that looks like an Indian puri and tastes like an American chip. There’s your steak and potatoes, baby.', 'Pot de Fromage and Lobster Ravioli', 'The killer app, however, is the sauteed foie gras with warm apples ($26). It’s paired with a roll of brioche so rich that if you stuff the warm, jiggly liver inside, you’ll have created one of the world’s great do-it-yourself foie gras donuts.', 'None of this is groundbreaking fare, nor is it intended to be. So here it’s worth noting that while younger restaurant groups like Momofuku and Major Food have rightly achieved fame and fortune by pushing the culinary envelope at every opportunity, McNally has somehow stayed relevant by riffing on the same bistro-style formula. His venues are the James Bond movie franchise of restaurants; you know what’s going to happen with each new installment (martinis are poured, the bad guy dies) but they still merit your attention because each is reliably awesome in its own semi-distinct way.', 'Cherche, for its part, serves what might be the fanciest food of McNally’s empire, even though the boisterous room, with paper placemats, pedestrian wine stems, and gorgeous tile floors, doesn’t feel a heck of a lot more formal than the late, lamented Pastis. No matter; this is where chefs Shane McBride (Balthazar) and Daniel Parilla show off their technical chops with dishes like hamachi crudo, the fatty fish sliced with as much precision as at a serious sushi spot.', 'Chefs Daniel Parilla and Shane McBride', 'Rare lamb saddle and braised shank, drenched in heady jus and finished with a grassy mint-tarragon puree, wouldn’t be out of place at a two-Michelin starred tasting menu restaurant. And salad Nicoise is just a study in how to do things right. The $26 entree is a bevy of anchovies, lemon smashed potatoes, sweet roasted tomatoes, lettuce slicked with olive tapenade and best of all, mouthwatering slices of seared bluefin tuna.', 'Warning: the menu exhibits some weakness in execution and conception. Frogs legs still taste underseasoned after they’re dunked in a heady garlic velouté. Roast chicken is both overcooked and under-sauced, with barely enough jus to coat the bird, never mind for dredging fries in. And while the burger as a whole is good, more of its flavor is derived from the gruyere and bacon marmalade than the dense patty, which doesn’t crumble with the same ease as it does at as, say, The NoMad Bar.', 'Top: Cherche Midi Prime Rib, Left: Cherche Midi Frog Legs, Right: Cherche Midi Burger', 'But really. You’ve come here for the expensive proteins. The dry-aged prime rib is a carnivore’s dream, exhibiting a split personality of flavors. The firm inside is all about the clean irons of a rare roast beef — right on. Then things get epically more interesting around the exterior ""cap,"" a study in dry-aged bliss with the the accordion-like texture of brisket and the musky aromas of the English countryside: blue cheese, black truffle, wet earth.', ""The de rigueur dessert? Ile flottant — soft mounds of meringue slathered in creme anglaise. If snow could warm up without melting, it would taste like this. The creation is nearly identical to La Grenouille's, a restaurant that’s been around since 1962. And if we’re lucky, we’ll be ordering the same dessert in a brand new spot a half century from now and we'll remark that’s the way they still do it at Cherche Midi. Yep, McNally wins again.""]"

Follow his progress in this travelogue/review series, The Road to the 38, and check back at the end of the year to find out which restaurants made the cut.\n  "", ""More than any other American luxury restaurant, Grace sits at the intersection of fine dining's past and present. At first glance, the place has an almost impersonal, pre-1980s serenity: creamy, hand-stitched leather club chairs; milk chocolate-colored tablecloths; art that brings to mind asymmetrical inkblot tests. After the eyes acclimate to the dim room, once a pickled herring factory, it's easier to appreciate the elegant grain of the brown ash wood paneling and the voluptuous forms of the columns built to resemble wine decanters (and, indeed, fitted with discrete stations for beverage service)."", 'But the design also leaves no doubt about the real atmospheric centerpiece: the kitchen, gleaming all white and steel and viewed through glass. Tables are angled for maximum observation of the more than 20 cooks assembling your dinner with balletic concentration. The setup reinforces all the modern notions about dining as an event, as participation theatre.', ""It was a performance that left me feeling uplifted. Grace's chef-owner Curtis Duffy, Eater's 2013 Chef of the Year, has absorbed the techniques of some towering, driven mentors to create his own kinetic style. Along with Corey Lee at Benu and Joshua Skenes at Saison, Duffy is on the front lines, defining the country's next generation of high-ticket dining. He discovered his life's path while cooking in home ec class during a stormy childhood. He moved to Chicago to work for Charlie Trotter and then with Grant Achatz, first at Trio and then as Achatz's chef de cuisine at Alinea. While executive chef at Avenues in the tony Peninsula Chicago hotel, Duffy earned two Michelin stars by displaying the sum of his experiences—food that links Trotter's refinement and love of vegetables with Achatz's wit and showmanship."", 'Alaskan king crab', ""Consider one of the signatures that Duffy developed at Avenues and refined for Grace. Alaskan king crab salad rests at the bottom of a V-shaped tumbler filled with enough flowers and herbs to recall a terrarium. The top is sealed with a tuile of flavor-neutral sugar, a modernist fillip that also slyly references Duffy's time at Trio as a pastry chef. Tap on the glass with a spoon and it shatters, adding fleeting crunch to the crab poached in a citrus stock reinforced by sweet-sour calamansi. Trout roe adds pop, cucumber juice lends astringency, and dollops of cream steeped with marigold and lemon mint (also the flowers and herb in the glass) emit an herbal pheromone. It's a feat of a dish that quickens the senses and leaves the diner energized for what's to come."", ""The crab is the second course in Duffy's Fauna menu, one of the two prix fixe options the restaurant offers. The other, not surprisingly, highlights Flora. Both cost $205 per person and deliver around 10 to 13 courses—a smaller number than at other tasting menu restaurants of similar cost and ambition, though it didn't take long for the progression to include plates of a substantial size, which I found satisfying."", 'The meal began with whimsy. Soon after being seated, a gnarly hollowed log arrived, its bark dotted with indulgent bites: an ear of baby corn paired with the juicy beads of finger limes, a sliver of nutty Iberico ham impaled on a metal skewer, a slice of lady finger banana brûléed, and a black truffle macaron that packed a sensual wallop. Then came a small jar containing a morsel of cod and filled with smoke. The contents had the milky opaqueness of yogurt, an effect emphasized by the foil wrapper affixed to the top. Of course there was fruit on the bottom: lychee, contrasted by a dab of osetra caviar.', 'Lamb with artichoke chips, smoked paprika gastrique, and frisee; Miyazaki beef with Vietnamese herbs', ""Presentations veered from fetchingly austere (a bowl of green grapes with carbonated juice, blueberries, and green chartreuse ice cream) to rococo, but the ingredients on even the most flamboyant plates always made sense together. An essay on lamb—loin cloaked in belly fat and roasted, pickled tongue—was punctuated with artichoke heart chips braised in brown butter, smoked paprika gastrique, curling white anchovies, frisee, and oxalis, a lemony herb that's part of the sorrel family. The evening's crowning glory was gorgeously marbled beef from Japan's Miyazaki prefecture. Duffy loves this protein and has concocted several stagings for it; this one was in the form of a deconstructed Thai beef salad. Raw and cooked forms of the meat hid among a forest of herbs, romaine lettuce cooked into marmalade, and peanuts both caramelized and pureed. Citrusy tom yum broth, poured tableside, provided the soprano line to the meat's baritone smoothness."", 'Peaches in jasmine tea cylinder', 'The pastry team stole the show with a peach dessert in a frozen cylinder of jasmine tea. Duffy worked with a mold maker for years to perfect a silicone model that could reproduce the same results night after night. This is the first time the kitchen has used it in a sweet dish, and it was wondrous: Braised and fresh white peaches, cream cheese ice cream, and Champagne foam filled the tea canister, which held its form but could also be easily sliced with a spoon. A lot going on, but the purity of the flavors gave me the same innocent happiness as eating a drippy peach over the kitchen sink.', ""Duffy receives ample support from general manager and partner Michael Muser, who leads a pitch-perfect service staff and oversees a beverage program that includes a diverse wine list (more bottles in the two-digits than one would expect) and some pricy but heady teas to end the meal. As every critic who writes about this restaurant reports: Don't miss the bathrooms themed to the seasons. Start with winter.""]"

Author of eight cookbooks, teacher, television host, fundraiser, Top Chef Masters champion: He's a one-man Mexican Empire."", ""In 1987, the same year Bayless published his first tome, Authentic Mexican, he and his wife Deann (who also co-penned the book) opened midscale Frontera Grill. It bridged the gap for Middle America, eschewing the combo plate but luring customers with smoky wafts from the grill fueled by hardwood coal, build-your-own tacos, and enigmatic moles. Precision-engineered margaritas smoothed the conversion. Two years later the Baylesses launched fine-dining Topolobampo in a room off one side of Frontera. It was the sophisticated approach to Mexican cuisine that Bayless had wanted to take in the first place, though he was smart enough to know he needed to first win over palates with Frontera's accessibility. He wooed at Topolo via saucing: wild turkey breast with heady chocolate mole, mahi mahi with poblano cream, empanadas napped in avocado puree."", ""Topolo is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this fall. Since then, Bayless has opened other restaurants, including a second location of casual torta shop Xoco in Chicago's Wicker Park last month (the original Xoco is next to Topolobampo) and two locations—with a third on the way—of his Mexi-Cali concept Red O in Los Angeles. Checking in on the siblings that became icons, I Bayless-binged by lunching at Frontera Grill and then having dinner at Topolo."", 'Street food trio: duck carnitas memelas (masa cake), cheese enchilada, shredded beef sopes', ""One of my closest friends, a Chicago native, took me to Frontera Grill on my first visit to the city in 1990. We stood huddled in the cold outside, waiting in line, and the restaurant's spasm of primary colors and campfire scents thawed us as soon as we shuffled through the door. I remember being mesmerized not just by the warmth of the flavors but the exactness of the food's seasoning: the fastidious ratios of salt and citrus in the ceviche, the black mole's dusky-sweet alchemy, the revelation of fresh corn tortillas. Eating at Frontera was an awakening."", ""The same friend and I are having lunch at Frontera over two decades later. We're wiser now: We arrived at the restaurant at 11:20 a.m., ten minutes before opening, to beat the wait. She wants all the classics: guacamole, smoked chicken taquitos, tacos, the killer chocolate-pecan pie with Kahlua whipped cream hat's been a staple since the restaurant's first month. I'm eyeing the novelties that frequently revolve through the menu and keep the kitchen's energy kindled. We order some of everything."", ""Part of Bayless's savvy as a restaurateur has been to distill his years of research into menus that provide all-inclusive tours of Mexican cookery. Oaxacan chile-marinated steaks and Mexico City-style quesadillas that resemble cornmeal turnovers share the spotlight with Veracruz salsas and Yucatan ceviches. Rather than a regional immersion, it all blurs into a satisfying whole. And the kitchen sometimes takes creative liberties with staples. Beyond the standard guacamole, for example, there are seasonal variations: We try one with fresh habaneros, grilled onions, roasted garlic, sour orange (popular in the Yucatan), and minty hoja santa as an intriguing departure from cilantro. The description sounds cacophonous but the flavors mellow and merge harmoniously."", 'Duck with date mole', ""Not every dish electrifies, though; the kitchen doesn't seem as rigorous with its execution as it once was. The flavors in the Frontera ceviche—albacore tuna with tomatoes, olives, and cilantro—are muddier than I remember, and the Oaxacan sopes filled with shredded beef aren't as wonderfully crisp. The lunch's most exciting effort is a study in duck: rosy breast in date mole (dates are an important crop in Baja California) with ancho chile to offset the sweet spices, and garnishes of duck prosciutto and duck chicarron that further balance with their earthiness."", ""A plucky dessert presenting corn three ways—cornmeal in a pound cake, sweet corn ice cream, and a scattering of caramel corn on the plate around silky sliced apricots—impresses but doesn't vanish as fast as the chocolate-pecan pie. The sweets have always been the least truly Mexican dishes at the restaurant, but it doesn't matter. Frontera is like an old friend at this point. Maybe the cooks could more finely tune their final results (a constant challenge in such an always-mobbed place) and perhaps nostalgia fuels some of the enjoyment, but Frontera is still worlds better than most of the country's serious Mexican restaurants. 445 Clark Street, 312-661-1434, fronteragrill.com.

He refreshed the sanctuary of a room with subtle decor tweaks, ordered new tableware (a mix of Bernardaud china and handmade Mexican pottery), and most notably changed the dining format. Rather than starters and mains, the kitchen makes every plate the same size and groups the menu into categories of dishes that reflect their defining characteristics: ""fresh,"" ""enchanting,"" ""complex,"" ""luxurious."" Three, five, or seven courses are standard, though the engaging staff will happily customize the meal to however many dishes you\'d like.', 'Lamb in chile rojo', 'It sounds a bit precious but it works as an enabling guide for individual tastes—and as a personality test of sorts. I\'m not exactly sure what it means that I was drawn to ""ancient"" and ""soulful,"" but the attraction brought haunting pleasures like goat barbacoa in a broth of braising juices and red chiles, strewn with chickpeas cooked just to the point of creaminess and with radishes for crisp, juicy counterpoint. Roasted purple potatoes achieved similarly profound flavor steeped in chileatole, a cross between a soup and a beverage thickened with corn masa and aromatic from guajillo chiles and musky epazote. One more meaty wonder: blushing lamb shoulder braised in hatch chiles (leaving traces of vegetal smokiness), flanked by wilted amaranth greens and sauced with red chile gravy and bone marrow-enriched potato crema. Chef de cuisine Andres Padilla knows how to romance the proteins.', 'These dishes succeeded so richly because they conjured the comforts of rustic Mexican cooking—the slow heat, the spicy insinuations. The most memorable creations stayed that course. A dish called ""Flowers and Cheese"" was comely but surprised with its intricacy: homemade queso fresco and sungold tomatoes hid under a ""masa veil,"" which was like a tamale rolled flat and crisped. Toasted ancho chile and browned butter gave the composition some heft, and the spray of edible herbs and flowers atop were of course from Bayless\'s rooftop garden overhead. When a dish\'s theme wandered too far, it disappointed. Lemon-tequila ice cream wasn\'t enough to wrangle a fiddly, deconstructed raspberry shortcake back to the fold. Much better to savor the cajeta crepes with chocolate, toasted meringue, and caramelized plantain ice cream.', 'Raspberry shortcake']"
303,"['\n  The transformation of Jersey City’s Newark Avenue from what was basically a Gujarati and Punjabi neighborhood 10 years ago to a South Indian one today was gradual but dramatic. With South Indian establishments now dominating, the two-block strip boasts the metropolitan area’s most concentrated collection of vegetarian restaurants, 11 out of a total of 22. And even the places that serve meat offer extensive vegetarian menus – it’s what South Indian diners demand. While dedicated dosa parlors like Sri Ganesha’s and Dosa Hut tender dozens of variations of the potato-stuffed pancake, more interesting perhaps are the restaurants that seek to cover the entire range of regional South Indian vegetarian fare. Sapthagiri was the first; now we have Chutneys.\n  ', 'Located near the western end of Little India, where Newark Avenue tails off into the swampy Meadowlands, Chutneys resembles a mini-chain of the same name based in Hyderabad, capital of the southern state of Telangana. ""We’ve refined the concept of the Chutneys in India,"" the restaurant’s proprietor asserted enthusiastically over the phone, then added sheepishly, ""but we’re not related."" The deep premises sports two rows of plush scarlet booths, each big enough for an entire family. The table settings include stainless steel drinking glasses, water pitchers, and chutney caddies offering a lavish assortment of six. Included are an unusual curry-leaf chutney, a generous cup of ghee, a zippy tomato chutney, and a spicy peanut powder that you might want to dump on everything. True to its name and gimmick, the restaurant offers 12 chutneys in all, available as extras for $1.99 each.', 'Chutneys classic dosa', 'Yes, there are dosas galore. If you’ve never had one, check out the fiery mysore masala dosa ($6.49) or the mellower butter masala dosa ($5.99). For something more byzantine, head for ""Chutney’s classic dosa,"" which is anything but classic: the filling runs to the frankly bizarre mixture of potatoes, raw baby spinach, crumbled paneer, cubed carrots, and melted cheddar. For the curator of obscure regional oddities, the steamed dosa ($8.99) might be the perfect thing. Rather than being fried thin and crisp, this pancake has been cooked in a steamer to something pale and spongy. Be forewarned it lacks the usual oniony potato filling; in fact, it lacks any filling at all. Then there’s MLA pesarattu, a mung-bean flapjack flavored with cumin and ginger. In this case the filling is upma – a cream of rice doctored with butter, chiles, and black mustard seeds that can be purchased separately ($6.99), making an excellent stoner’s breakfast.', 'Left: Kaju masala; Right: Mysore bonda', 'But what Chutneys does with dosas pales in comparison to its wizardry with idli – the white dumplings shaped like flying saucers. Named after a region of the Tamil Nadu state, Chettinad idli ($6.99) betokens deep-friend spongy fingers heaped with a chunky lentil-tamarind sauce, a good choice if you’ve got a sweet tooth. ""Mini ghee idli"" turns out to be darling little baby idlis bobbing in a brown gravy, while most unusual of all is the so-called gongura sandwich – two humongous idlis cut like Kaiser rolls and smeared with a gritty filling that will set your mouth on fire, made from a leafy plant essential to Telugu cuisine.', 'Wandering around the menu you’ll discover such Indian-Chinese appetizers as the highly recommended gobi 65 – small nuggets of cauliflower annealed with a bright red glaze; and northern Indian curries, including a wonderful mushroom masala ($10.99). The curries on Chutneys’ menu will be familiar to anyone accustomed to eating Indian food on, say, the Upper West Side, with the exception of a few of the crazier ones, such as kaju masala, featuring cashews bobbing in tomato sauce. Another equally novel curry is aimed at Jains, a religious group that eschews onions and garlic. Nilgiri korma ($9.99) glows an eerie shade of green, a diverse collection of vegetables in a sauce of pureed fresh mint. Don’t worry, it doesn’t taste like toothpaste!', 'Paal Appam', 'But the real gems of the menu might be the home-style rice-based stews and casseroles, which include pongal (cooked with ginger, black peppercorns, and ghee) and curd rice (cooked with yogurt and curry leaves). A friend who grew up in Houston but often returned to India to visit his family in Bangalore pointed to the mellifluous-sounding bis bela bath ($7.99) and exclaimed, ""My grannie makes that. I never expected to find it on an Indian menu in New Jersey."" This delectable damp risotto of crushed rice and veggies in a shredded coconut sauce is scented with asafoetida: a tree resin that tastes like onions, which gave the English language the word ""fetid.""', 'Indeed, when it comes to presenting obscure regional specialties restricted to small geographic areas of South India, Chutneys is without peer. And currently, there’s no better dining adventure in (or out) of the five boroughs.']"
304,"['\n  Trevor Moran arranged a few starry white onion flowers atop the plates he was finishing, and then he scooted them over to our group’s corner of The Catbird Seat’s three-sided, twenty-seat counter. “Tomatoes with very old ham,” he announced. To magnify their essence, Moran and his cooks lightly brined and dried the tomatoes for two days, until their color turned bloody but the texture remained lush. They shaved on grizzled specimens from The Hamery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; it looked like rousong (a.k.a. Chinese pork floss) and tasted, pleasantly, of mineral and funk. Tomato water flavored with tomato vinegar and lemon verbena oil created a fragrant moat.\n  ', 'Many elements, but their combined effect was direct: It embodied the moment in the South when balmy days yield to cool evenings, and the grassy smell of changing seasons floats in the air.', 'Pork with apples and matsutake mushrooms in chicken broth', 'Moran, a native of Ireland, has grasped the gist of his new home in a remarkably short time. For four years he cooked at Noma, working his way up to sous chef, before moving to Nashville. After apprenticing at The Catbird Seat for six months, he replaced departing chef Erik Anderson in January. Anderson—along with Josh Habiger, who left The Catbird Seat to help run the new dining and entertainment complex Pinewood Social (the two share owners)—earned raves almost as soon as the restaurant opened in 2011. They had stints at Alinea, Noma, The French Laundry, and The Fat Duck between them, and they created wizardly tasting menus that mashed local and global flavors with modernist wit. Their most famous creation was often the meal’s first bite: an ode to Nashville hot chicken in the form of fried chicken skin seasoned with sorghum, Korean chile flakes, dill powder, and a winky puree of Wonder bread.', 'Left: Cobia in sweet potato broth, Right: Ice cream salad with sorrel', 'The city’s restaurant boom has already detonated, but Anderson and Habiger’s daring achieved another level of cachet altogether. No one in the sweep of the country between Washington DC’s Minibar and Houston’s Oxheart had previously pulled off this kind of high-minded cuisine. It succeeded in part because Nashville is a city of performers. Two chefs preparing dinner center-stage in an intimate space and then delivering theatrical (and delectable) dishes to a counter-side audience? The format resonated.', 'Thrillingly, Moran stepped into the spotlight and has made the platform his own. He bandies his share of culinary bons mots—whipped fondue spiked with PBR comes in a cone made from crushed bar nuts, a hillbilly homage to Thomas Keller—but he uses his Noma training to stunning effect. For tartare, he blends dry-aged strip loin with grains like quinoa, buckwheat, forbidden rice, and sourdough bread crumbs; dapples the mixture with blackberries for sour-sweetness and green peanut oil for richness; and decorates the bowl with citrus begonias that, beyond their beauty, also lend a rhubarb-like astringency. He simmers small potatoes just to the edge of tenderness, and then serves them in a broth buoyed with ale yeast from local Yazoo Brewing Company, thickened with smoked bread, and smoothed with crème fraîche.', 'Here, at last, is the restaurant in America that doesn’t get too caught up in the austere facets of the New Nordic aesthetic. Light, clean, subtle Scandinavian approach meets florid Southern warmth: This marriage of opposites will stick.', ""Our three-hour meal blazed by in a hum of interactivity. The cooks kept us engaged in descriptions and conversations, but not so much that it distracted from the pleasures at hand—literally. Much of the food is eaten without utensils; it would have been wonderful if the staff had presented hand towels when the evening started. For a superb finale, pastry pro Kelly White assembled discs of moist cake arranged with last-of-the-season blueberries from Saskatchewan (far superior to most Southern blueberries, so I didn't mind the distance these traveled), elderflower spheres, and orbs of cucumber."", 'A refreshing closer, but there was one more dish to come. Kartoffelkage is a Danish pastry. The word means ""potato cake"" but refers to the shape; there are no spuds in the original recipe. In a nod to his Irish heritage, Moran added it by whipping mashed potato as part of an airy custard that he piped into an tuber-shaped choux pastry glossed with marzipan. I usually wince at edible soil, but this number did look awfully cute sitting in a paper bag on a bed of crushed cookies with cocoa nibs, powdered trumpet mushrooms, and tonka beans. It was a spectacle worthy of the most insatiable Southern sweet tooth and yet tidily summarized all the influences thus far in Moran\'s ascending career.', ""Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in North America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in North America.

Another staffer set down hollowed logs containing what looked like ears of corn, roasted in their husks. With a touch of the fork, the charred white and yellow corn niblets gave way to grits—nutty and wholesome but also extravagantly perfumed with truffles, manchego, ham, and sherry. (The can was meant to be a receptacle for discarded husks.)

That's not to say it's boring or predictable: Far from it. But Achatz and executive chef Mike Bagale are in a phase where much of their food comments on pop culture in ways that are wry yet recognizable. Now more than ever, we're in on the jokes. So buy a ticket and step right up through the funhouse doors (literally; you'll see) for a menu that lightly gambols along the tightrope between fantasy and earthly pleasure.

While we spooned up an exotic mid-meal palate cleanser of sliced lily bulb zingy with finger lime beads, a server dropped off a craggy stone piled with lit binchotan, the charcoal essential to Japanese-style grilling. The flames concealed logs of parsnip and pork belly wrapped in kombu seaweed. Servers plucked them from the fire and unwrapped tableside—a flambé flourish for the new millennium. In previous iterations, wagyu beef starred rather than pork, and for the price (well over $300 per person) I would have preferred the sumptuous beef.', 'Lobster with saffron curry; Sweetbreads with cinnamon chopsticks', 'Hunks of lobster in pools of saffron curry perched amid fillips that evoked Indian cuisine through a British filter—coconut pudding, compressed cucumber, gel cubes fragrant with Earl Grey tea.

306,"['\n  Near the end of my 20-course, $459 meal for one at Atera, a bearded staffer in an expensive suit began the “Gong Fu” process of preparing Phoenix oolong tea, a complicated series of steps that involved tempering the cups, awakening the aroma of the leaves with hot water (not for drinking!), swirling the tea pot in a circular motion (for even distribution — can I drink it now?), and generously allowing me to consume the prized second, third and fourth infusions, whose precious liquor smelled like lychee and tasted like grass. The ceremony was preceded by a brief dialogue on how the flavor of the brew would’ve been different had the Chinese product been harvested at a different altitude, and just in case there was any confusion, the gentleman overseeing the rituals handed me his business card, on which was printed a single, Portlandia-esque title: “Tea Curator.” You’ve got to be kidding me.\n  ', 'Alas, the tea curator does not kid. It’s a story worth recounting not just because it was absolutely mental (and highlight of my evening), but because it’s a kick-ass luxury that highlights how the Atera experience is dramatically different than the slightly leaner (and markedly cheaper) affair of 2012, the Tribeca venue’s inaugural year.', 'New York sour', 'The room it still the same: thirteen seats at a chef’s counter surrounding the open kitchen. The menu format is virtually identical: 20 or so courses the size of passed wedding hors d’oeuvres. The chefs still wield tweezers and eye-droppers with the precision of paleontologists unearthing dinosaur fossils. And yet the food has evolved so much from the early days that one might conclude that there’s a new chef at the helm here. There is not. Matthew Lightner, who picked up two Michelin stars and the accolades of virtually every critic in town when Atera opened two and a half years ago, is still the sarge in charge. And the slightly sad news is that his creations have shed a bit of their childlike whimsy as his restaurant has grown up.', 'King crab with cream, rhubarb juice, coconut oil', 'Nearly all of the Lightner’s brilliant ""hocus pocus"" dishes have vanished. Gone is the sable-covered sorbet that’s painted to look like a rock. Banished is the foie gras shaped to resemble a peanut. No more are there vaguely fishy cookies served as appetizers. Instead of fish egg macarons, there’s just plain jane caviar. (The good news: That caviar, 10 grams of Bulgarian golden osetra, exhibits soft, subtle maritime flavors and a short finish and is flanked by tapenade and ""burnt cream"" to evoke the salty-sweet essence of the ocean.)', 'Change is risky. Even the most ambitious culinary establishments, the ones that overhaul half their menu every month or so, tend to stay the course with their larger approach to cuisine. But rest assured that Atera, despite its tectonic shifts, has grown into one of New York’s most rewarding bastions of fine dining. The old style of ""trompe bouche,"" where food looked like one thing but tasted like another — has given way to a compelling, ultra-refined naturalism.', 'The old Atera would’ve served you razor clams with the ""edible shells"" — really air baguettes in disguise. Now, we pick at tiny stacks of surf clam, spring garlic, turnips, and leeks, a bevy of aromatic vegetables that recall clean sea breeze. Lightner once served chicken noodle soup, where the ""pasta"" was made from squid. Now he offers cool mushroom consomme, the shallow broth lending its woodsy tones to a few slices of charcoal-warmed fluke, pink artichoke petals, and rose vinegar. Instead of a high-end riff on a nostalgic classic (Campbell’s), we get an esoteric ode to the colors pink, white, and black, like a flower sitting on the forest floor.', 'Now here’s your terrine of the year: a grassy lamb tartare turned mildly sour and musky with a dab of porky njuda and tempered with the creaminess of raw shrimp. Rockin.', 'Just keep in mind it’s not the best deal in town. Dinner, once $150, is now $195, or $245 with the caviar supplement. Tack on a wine pairing and you’re at $1,018 for two after tax and tip. Care for Champagne? The only listed offering by the glass is $45.', 'Clockwise from top left: Milk Punch and Camillo cocktails; Grapes with leaves; Sunchoke bar snacks; Trout roe with corn puree', 'Of course, with more money, comes more amenities. A lounge downstairs now accommodates guests who arrive early (or those who want to linger after the second seating arrives). That separate space offers bite-size treats like fish-sauced beef jerky with the texture of prunes, tiny pig’s blood tarts with tomato jam (two degrees of red, one rich, one sour), and a burger that easily ranks among the city’s best. Lightner blends aged short rib, loin, and round, tosses in some marrow and tendon, and arrives at a soft terrine-like creation where every bite tastes like the greasy, griddled exterior of a Shake Shack burger. Wicked.', 'Back upstairs, Lightner places trout roe atop a parfait of corn puree, egg yolk jam, and sesame praline arranged in such a way as to mimic a sunflower blossom. He drapes carrot puree over sea urchin as a short essay in orange, with the root acting as the cool, reserved foil to the achingly sweet uni. Call it ""surf and earth."" And for a bit of turf, Lightner pairs Mangalitsa pork — aged for three weeks — with a fat slice of abalone and grills them both to identical textures, letting the diner bask in two degrees of funk, one swine, the other shellfish.', 'Mangalitsa pork loin, aged three-weeks, with grilled abalone', 'Dessert happens fast — raspberry sorbet with licorice here, chocolate mignardises there. This is when that the tea curator shows up, ready to peddle $13 worth of matcha, whisked tableside into a sweet, foamy, seaweed-y bliss — following a brief lecture of the nature of the product.', 'Atera is epically more mature than it used to be.

Even on one of the city's frequently overcast days, the light streams through the back wall of windows and bounces cheerfully off the hodgepodge of brick, woods, metal, and concrete. Chef-owner Matt Dillon originally opened Sitka & Spruce, his first restaurant, eight years ago in a spare strip mall space two miles away in the Eastlake community. His menu—mingling the Pacific Northwest's seasonal, regional sense with Italy's exuberant sensibility—lured food obsessives and chefs.

I lived in Seattle in the late 1990s and haven't spent much time here since, but eating at Sitka & Spruce helped fill in the years. This is a place to linger to absorb the city's essence. Dishes like hop-cured salmon strengthen the sense of place: The fish is layered in Dominoes fashion with apple slices, and crisped slivers of sourdough, affixed in cultured cream and garnished with agretti, an Italian succulent with chive-like greens. Fresh elderberries (the length of the growing season for berries in the Pacific Northwest is damned enviable), walnuts, wildflower honey, and torn mint make a bowl of homemade yogurt about as exhilarating as humanly possible."", 'Yogurt with elderberries, walnuts, and honey; Cured salmon with apples, cultured cream, and sourdough', ""Some dishes meandered to other lands with equal grace. The same yogurt, mixed with herbs, smoothed the texture of eggs baked North African style in a ceramic casserole with merguez, tomatoes, and olives. A thick blintz subbed for dessert, rolled around soft ricotta and drizzled with plum syrup. Brunch cooks get a bad rap, but this crew (manning the stove less than six feet away from our perch at the restaurant's communal table) pulled off the country's most contentious mealtime with rare finesse.

308,"[""Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas may have been the first place in America to shine major attention on northern Thai specialties, with its grilled meats, shock of herbs, and spice-driven dishes so different from the color-by-number coconut curries that star on most Thai restaurant menus. Yet Ricker, with four restaurants in Portland and three in New York, has proven to be a careful translator with mass appeal. He's troweled and deconstructed recipes during two decades of travel to Thailand (and counting), and his replicas hit the hot spots of our modern palate. Ricker's signature charcoal-roasted hen — garlicky, stuffed with lemongrass, and served with sharp, puckery dipping sauces with ingredients like tamarind — opens a portal to fiercer, funkier pleasures such as chopped duck salad, the bird's liver offset by an uppercut of lime juice and fish sauce."", 'Cha Ca ""La Vong"" at Pok Pok; Miang kham at Whisky Soda Lounge', ""A recent weeknight scene at Pok Pok proved typical. I slid around the wall of waiting bodies to find my friend, who'd just put in her name for a table. Quoted time: 45 minutes. We crossed the street to Ricker's Whiskey Soda Lounge, which launched in 2009 as a valve release for the mounting pressures on Pok Pok. It soon developed its own personality, serving Thai pub snacks and cocktails potent and acidic enough to keep up with the spice and heat. It would be tempting to settle in for dinner at the bar, its back wall painted a shade of tropical turquoise that makes one long for a swim, and graze through the list of nearly 20 dishes."", ""We ordered lightly to hold out for the main event. Pork riblets, cured in a rice and garlic paste and deep-fried fried, had an intriguing sourness that primed the taste buds. Miang kham made an ideal early-evening nibble: minced clusters of chiles, ginger, peanuts, dried shrimp, coconut, and lime were bound in a sauce that included palm sugar, tamarind, and shrimp paste and then placed on pepper betel leaves. Like so many of Ricker's recreations, it had more ingredients than the brain can easily absorb, but it tasted more harmonious with every bite. I sipped a cocktail made with mekhong, the Thai spirit largely distilled with sugar cane but also infused with rice for a sneaky aftertaste that recalls sake."", 'Chiang Mai sausage with herbs', 'Pok Pok texted us exactly 44 minutes later, and we were soon sitting in a packed room with a compact bar and walls that morphed from red brick to wood paneling halfway up. Our server was tall and serious and took unusual pride in pacing out our meal so the plates never piled up. What struck me was the symphonic balance in every dish. Chiang Mai sausage, for example, soared with fluty lemongrass and galangal and boomed with fish sauce and chile while ground pork shoulder and belly took the melody. Fresh turmeric and cilantro gave it painterly color. Green chile dipping sauce and pork rinds echoed the flavors. It was cooking that doubled as tabletop performance.', 'The finesse extended to the dishes that weren\'t strictly Thai. The restaurant\'s famous chicken wings were as narcotic as expected. Ricker\'s first employee, Ich ""Ike"" Truong, hailed from Vietnam. To the Pok Pok repertoire he contributed a snack of marinated wings fried and then tossed in a wok until set in amber of fish sauce, sugar, and chile paste. Bits of caramelized garlic were caught in the stickiness. And Ricker\'s take on Cha Ca La Vong, a catfish salad of sorts inspired by a restaurant in Hanoi that serves this one specialty, was a marvel of satisfactions. Golden hunks of fish (the hue in part stemming from oil tinted with turmeric) contrasted with herbs in turn bitter, earthy, and sweet; rice noodles underneath entertained the teeth.', 'When discussing the food he studies and cooks, Ricker likes to refer to himself as a ""copycat."" It\'s a commendable stance, the white guy not wanting to take credit for a cuisine whose layered complexities remain foreign to most of us. But if his influence keeps broadening our understanding of Southeast Asian cooking, and if his success helps Thai or Vietnamese natives who run restaurants in America find success preparing their regional specialties, then I\'d say his imitation is more than flattery.

309,"['\n  Once upon a time, New York restaurants were a fairy tale world of conspicuous consumption. Investment banks had funny names like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. And hedge funders feasted at fancy pants spots like Veritas, where bottles of Screaming Eagle and Lafite Rothschild commanded more money than tuition at SUNY Binghamton. Then, in 2008, the financial crisis hit. Veritas shuttered in 2013 and became Élan in June, selling affordable duck burgers and confining the majority of its wine list to bottles under $105. The place is packed every night. The end.\n  ', ""The lesson is this: six-and-seven-digit wine buying — at restaurants at least — is now largely a thing of the past. Cru, another haven of oenophilic extravagance during the gilded aughts, closed in 2010; that space is now Claudette, a Provencal joint for $13 ratatouille tarts and $10 rose sangria. And while no one can predict what kind of over-the-top opulence might reappear in our city's hospitality industry now that new skyscrapers (with their $90 million penthouses) are rising along Central Park South again, I like to hope that Élan and other honest, everyday places will be around for longer than restaurants where oligarchs drink $19,000 bottles of Petrus."", ""There's a good reason the smart money's on Élan. David Waltuck, the chef, has been at it for longer than The Simpsons. The pioneer opened Chanterelle in Soho in 1979, moved it to Tribeca in 1989 and saw it thrive for three decades. It was a fine dining spot that would, along with Drew Nieporent's Montrachet, help establish downtown not just as a destination for fine dining but for fine living as well. Chanterelle's menus were handwritten (in English, no less) and there was no dress code, a stark contrast to jacket-and-tie joints like Lutece, La Caravelle, and La Côte Basque. Such policies all helped usher in an era of more relaxed haute-gastronomy that everyone from Gramercy Tavern (across the street from Élan) to Craft (around the block) owes a bit gratitude toward."", '', 'Tomato watermelon gazpacho with lobster and crisp ham', ""Chanterelle closed in 2009, but Waltuck has brought back some of the classics to Élan, along with his old general manager, George Stinson (now co-owner), who might serve you Chanterelle's famous seafood sausage himself. The link is a blend of scallops, lobster, shrimp, and bass mousse drenched in beurre blance. No, it doesn't have springy texture or head-turning clarity of flavor as April Bloomfield's better version at The Breslin, but it gets the job done. Pair that with a nimble $18 Alvarinho, a half-dozen fried or raw oysters (the latter are slightly over-sauced with a ginger mignonette), and you have yourself a light, civilized, and not terribly expensive meal."", ""Will you have inspired food worthy of conversation in culinary circles at Élan? Maybe. Or maybe not. The menu is pocked with snoozers like under-seasoned vegetables with yogurt-feta flan, bland chicken breast in a saccharine corn miso broth, and ho-hum zucchini blossoms. But Waltuck, for the most part, dishes out serviceable fare at reasonable prices — no starters over $19 and no mains over $35. I'll take it."", 'Restaurants of course are about more than just the food. They\'re gathering places for like-minded people, and occasionally those of a certain age. So here it\'s worth noting that Élan, like Nieporent\'s Bâtard, attracts a more ""adult"" crowd that one might find at say Empellon Cocina or any other trendy East Village culinary establishment. Sound levels are unusually subdued. Cushy dining room seating is set aside for that increasingly rare policy that my seniors still like to abide by — making reservations. And the bar room for walk-ins boasts soft seats with lumbar support.', ""The irony is that one will easily encounter New York restaurants that are both pricier yet less comfortable (and a heck of a lot noisier) than Élan. If Chanterelle was a bellwether in loosening the strictures of fine dining, Waltuck's new hangout is a reminder not to take that loosening too far, even at casual spots."", 'Coarse terrine, an old-school favorite, is forever relevant here with its rustic flavors and gently cool temperature; so many restaurants over-chill their terrines. The potato potstickers, essentially a plate of large, potato-filled pierogis, justify their $18 price tag via a generous shaving of summer truffles. And lamb two ways is a show-stopper, a mix of grassy loin, rich jus, and heady ground meat in the form of moussaka', 'Risotto and mackerel; Duck burger', ""Then things take a turn for the worse. General Tso's sweetbreads offer up overcooked organs and a diluted riff on the already average flavors of Chinese-American takeout. Foie gras lollipops somehow take regal duck liver and, thanks to a hint of under-seasoning and perhaps a bit of oxidation, render the product nearly indistinguishable from peanut butter. Clam-dashi risotto with yuzu is firm and fragrant, but the mackerel on top is a dry, under-salted, sorry affair — and are we really garnishing good risotto with giant slabs of protein in 2014?."", 'Fettucine with scallops, with no compelling sauce to tie the affair together, would have barely passed muster at an all-you-can-eat Vegas buffet. And that duck burger is just so-so, a tender grind without the same depth of flavor as better beef or lamb patties around town.', '', 'Blackberry tart with a sweet corn shell', ""No matter. Order correctly and you're in for a treat. Vadouvan-spiced salmon sports that deft balance between good oil and a subtle smoke. And desserts are beyond reproach, from a blackberry tart with a sweet corn shell to a He-Man sized sundae of intoxicating stone fruits. No, the food isn't as exciting or even well-thought-out as at some of the city's more ambitious mess halls, but I like to think there's a larger moral to this story.

310,"['Seattle\'s most reliable address for a casual, of-the-moment meal may be the Fremont Collective—a warehouse in the Wallingford neighborhood (about four miles north of downtown) that was revamped to industrial chicness in 2012. Two adjacent restaurants front the complex: Renee Erickson\'s\xa0The Whale Wins and Joule, the new location of a local favorite run by husband-and-wife chefs Rachel Yang and Seif Chirchi. A kitschy, sky-blue neon sign hanging over bar near the entrance telegraphs the style of food: It advertises jewelry (the ""ry"" blacked out to emphasize the word play) in English letters and in Korean characters, a nod to Yang\'s heritage.', 'Short rib steak with grilled kimchi', ""The couple originally opened Joule in 2007 in a small storefront not far from the new space. Following Joule's success, three years later Yang and Chirchi opened Revel, a cafe serving refined takes on dumplings, pancakes, noodle dishes, and rice bowls. And just last month they unveiled a massive project, Trove, which combines Korean barbecue tabletop grills with a noodle counter, a frozen custard window, and a bar/lounge area under one 4,000-square-foot roof on Capitol Hill."", ""It's a testament to the strength of Joule's kitchen crew that Yang and Chirchi's flagship is sending out such on-point food while the duo has their attention stretched in so many directions. (They also have two boys under five years old.) Their twist on kalbi, Korean grilled short ribs, became a signature even before the move. The marinade blends sake, mirin, and pureed Asian pear with garlic and soy sauce, and the infusion of complex sweetness in the meat tangos lithely with gochuchang (Korean chile paste) and a bed of grilled kimchi in ways that keep each bite compelling."", 'Rce cakes with mustard greens and chorizo; Shrimp cocktail 2.0', 'You can also order hanger steak accented with fermented soy beans and a flat-iron cut crusted in earthy long pepper, but this is no attempt at an Asian chophouse concept.

The food is meant to be shared family style, with an emphasis on smaller plates. Oval versions of tteok, Korean rice cakes, arrive crisp-edged yet chewy—somewhere on the dumpling evolutionary spectrum between savory mochi and gnocchi. They\'re all about texture, so the pickled mustard greens and browned hunks of chorizo tossed among them can run untamed over the taste buds. The restaurant makes its own tofu, gently smokes it, and then adds a confit of hon-shimeji mushrooms scented with thyme and a bath of soy-truffle vinaigrette—the one usage for truffle oil that I don\'t find offensive.

First there's the decor; the owners looked to Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou for the twee, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic. Behind the bar they built a vessel-shaped shelf and hired Seattle artists to fill its cubbies with dioramas—some nautical and some, like a tableau of a yeti, simply quirky.

And the location can certainly be hypnotic. It was a warm, clear, Indian summer Saturday when I ate at Westward last month. Winding through labyrinthine back streets to reach the place, I glimpsed snow-capped Mount Rainier rising mythically in the distance. On the restaurant's patio, people sat in Adirondack chairs with cocktails or beers in hand, gazing at the water and the city's downtown skyline beyond.

Dishes with Mediterranean flavors often proved more engaging than those that leaned local. Among party dishes, I'd take the halloumi saganaki flamed tableside in ouzo (which rekindled memories of a recent trip to Mykonos) over a bland, monotonous clam dip (which flung me back to my Middle American suburban childhood). A pretty salad of farro, goat cheese, pine nuts, caramelized ribbons of onion, and smoked nectarines came unevenly seasoned. But sweet and pungent ras el hanout, the North African spice mix, gave fried oysters with aioli some electric jolts.

This is a laborious recipe that involves brining, a buttermilk soak, a spice blend favored by Fuller's grandmother, and double frying."", ""As a fried chicken obsessive, I was a little stunned to rate this among the finest examples I've found across the country. I didn't come to Seattle looking for superlative gospel bird, yet here it was. The chicken was dipped in buttermilk and egg and dredged in seasoned flour, and the rippling, crackly crust marries the meat but wasn't overly thick.

Asian flavors also slip into specials like fried Winterpoint oysters strewn with crisp, shredded pork ""floss"" and kimchi. ', 'Clambake', 'Locals surely relish the changeup of cross-cultural seasonings. I savored the traditional New England dishes: a platter of raw oysters, creamy lobster stew perfumed with sherry, and a condensed but exuberant version of the classic clambake. A basket came crammed full of steamer clams (with their tail-like siphons still attached), mussels, lobster, new potatoes, slices of salt pork, a hard-boiled egg, and drawn butter. To drink with all this? The beverage list was impressively thorough: zippy cocktails, local brews, a selection of white wines that leaned French, and even a smart mix of sherries, sakes, and vermouths. ', 'Blueberry pie with blueberry ice cream', ""My only complaint: Our server delivered our entire meal—small plates and large—in the course of five minutes. She couldn't rush us out the door before dessert, though. The pie of the day, naturally, was wild blueberry, paired with a scoop of blueberry ice cream.

It sounds simple, but it was a combination so full of vitality. It reminded me that too many lackluster salads are served in the world. It's a standard reaction to Sam Hayward's cuisine. When he opened Fore Street in 1996, it helped set Portland's now-roaring dining scene into motion. Hayward was an early champion of the locavore aesthetic. He made farmers part of the restaurant community. He used old boxcars for the floors and fashioned tables and other furniture from decrepit farm buildings. "", ""Meaty gusts from the open kitchen's 35-foot hearth greet you before the hostess does. Take cues for ordering accordingly: The menu changes daily (and isn't listed online) but look for high-on-the-food-chain pleasures like grilled quail in unctuous jus with hushpuppies, spit-roasted pork loin with sauerkraut, and a duo of blushing duck breast and crisp-skinned confit. Along with a leafy composition du jour, start with the chilled seafood plate; on the night I dined there it included scallop ceviche, house smoked mussels, and house cured arctic char. Think of the cooking, in its straightforward clarity, as the East Coast bookend to Chez Panisse.

Case in point: the newly opened Slab in former Portland Public Market building, which serves Sicilian-inspired street food. Stephen Lanzalotta made his name at a local grocery store, baking billowy loafs of flatbread that share little in common with the dense, rectangular pies often served in Italian-American restaurants. To launch Slab, Lanzalotta teamed with four business partners, including Jason Loring, chef-owner of nearby Nosh Kitchen Bar. The beverage of choice is beer, with twenty rotating (and mostly local) brews on tap.', ""I didn't expect Lanzalotta's specialty—a one-pound slice with a texture between focaccia and Parker House rolls, thinly painted with tomato sauce and specked with mozzarella and provolone—to be one of the best things I ate on the trip. But it was, and the hits didn't stop there. Sicilian is most often referenced as the ancestral homeland of Sunday gravy, and the restaurant duly offers a mean meatball sandwich. But the cuisine is also knotty from centuries of conquest, including from Arab colonists who brought their crops to the island. Lanzalotta honors the heritage with Sicilian street food dishes like hummus, an edifying variation seasoned with whole crushed oranges, turmeric, fried sage, a mere scent of cinnamon, and homemade tahini.

That includes seasoning ingredients: No black pepper, no sugar cane, no citrus for acidity. To attempt a cuisine so arduously local in a climate that is bitter much of the year, it's no surprise that Levi looks to the New Nordic movement for inspiration. He staged at both Copenhagen's Noma and Sweden's Fäviken. His dining room has an appealing, natural minimalism—light woods, knobby birch twigs covering sound-muffling panels. Though he still likes them crafted as close as possible, Levi makes concessions for alcohol. There are wines from Slovenia and France and Italy, though a cocktail like the Pine Gimlet (Barr Hill gin from Vermont, condensed yogurt whey, white pine syrup) evokes a satisfying sense of place. "", 'The spirit of the approach is admirable, but less than a year in Levi still needs to fine-tune the harmony of honoring his aesthetic while preparing food that tastes balanced. The menu of small plates can be ordered a la carte or in five courses for sixty dollars. Some of it is splendid, like a smooth herb soup refreshing with cucumber and dots of locally processed sunflower oil. A plate of chicken—white and dark meat in a shallow pool of rich stock with squash and an herb sauce earthy with sage—was so satisfying my group ordered a second round, but largely because many of the other dishes had left us wanting. ', ""A broth of yogurt whey, cayenne, and garlic for mussels was oddly sweet. Levi layers on another challenge for himself: His restaurant is gluten-free. As a Southerner I know that sublime cornbread can be made with no wheat; Levi's was a dry, sticky mass. A lovely stack of shaved fennel with yogurt and cucumber needed salt and acid: Could a gentle vinegar be made useful? The elements on an arty plate of pork belly with blueberry splatters, grits, pickle, and pork rind never quite came together. A bowl of blueberries lolling in custard sounded like a comforting finale, but steeping the custard in anise hyssop made the custard astringent and unpleasant."", 'Misses were acute enough that we spoke up to the server. He nodded and agreed: the fennel dish needed more salt, it would be great if the chef relented and served bread. But it was the pacifying assent of the converted.

313,"['\n  When the first pie landed on the table, our group of six nabbed slices eagerly. We\'d made the pilgrimage to 90-year-old Totonno\'s on Coney Island and waited nearly an hour (at 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday afternoon) for our seats. We began eating, and then a silence fell. Each of us stared at our plates. Finally someone said the words we were all thinking: ""What\'s happened to the pizza?""\n  ', ""Totonno's sausage and garlic pizza"", 'My colleague Robert Sietsema was with us and looked distraught. He’s a veteran champion of Totonno’s, labeling it last year as ""the best pizzeria in the world."" The place has long served the archetype that, before the last decade’s pizza revolution, taught neophytes (me included, when I lived in New York in the 90s) about the wonders a simple pie could achieve. We learned under the stern eye of Louise ""Cookie"" Ciminieri, the granddaughter of Antonio ""Totonno"" Pero who started his business among Coney Island’s burgeoning Italian-American community in 1924.', 'Too bad the pies didn’t reach anywhere near their usual distinction.', 'The restaurant has endured two setbacks in the last five years. In 2009 an oven fire closed its doors; it took nearly a year to reopen. Then four feet of water flooded the space during Hurricane Sandy. Ciminieri, who owns Totonno’s with siblings Antoinette Balzano and Frank Balzano, secured enough bank loans and help from the community to resurrect the place in five months. Sietsema has visited more than once post-Sandy and said the pizza was as sublime as ever. (He didn’t recognize the pizzaiolo on duty that day.) There were heartening sights: the room filled with families and couples, the walls lined with framed clippings from decades of praise, and Ciminieri zigzagging around in her lovably gruff way. Too bad the pies didn’t reach anywhere near their usual distinction.', 'The Sunday menu at Roberta’s in Bushwick bypasses hollandaise-glopped clichés. Not even the most vocal brunch haters will protest. As at lunch and dinner on other days, the restaurant offers charcuterie, including its\xa0rightfully praised duck prosciutto, red and white tendrils of intensified poultry strewn on a plate with a jagged wedge of baguette. Salads transcend any specific mealtime. One recent example combined varieties of tomato with cucumber shavings, sesame seeds, and a smooth pesto feral with garlic. Rotating egg dishes mimic lunch counter breakfast specials. A melted slice of American cheese clings to an egg cooked sunny-side up and draped over half of a croissant. Two pieces of stubby, richly smoky bacon poke out, and the fingerlings alongside crackle with every bite.', 'Bacon, egg, and cheese with croissant and potatoes, Dakine pizza, Involto, Tomato salad', 'And of course there is pizza, Roberta’s bedrock. Head pizzaiolo Anthony Falco and his crew are part of the new school of pie pipers: They construct elegant Neapolitan-New York crossbreeds that are built on tradition (the dough yields fragrant, tender-sturdy crust) but also freewheel with toppings. The popular Dakine rotates on and off the menu but particularly appeals at brunch with its sweet-savory repartee—a 2.0 take on the Hawaiian with slivers of fresh pineapple, mozzarella, ricotta, extra hammy prosciutto cotto, and splotches of jalapeño. Ours came pockmarked in all the right ways. The lip was pouty without heading into Meg Ryan territory.', 'We also ordered an Involto, Roberta’s calzone-stromboli hybrid. The dough envelops mozzarella, parmesan, ricotta, sliced soppresata, roasted red pepper, and a varnish of tomato sauce. One end was sealed and the other was left agape like an open mouth; it brought to mind a suckerfish on the side of an aquarium. We devoured it.']"
314,"['\n  My companion sighed when I announced we were ordering the five-course menu at Huertas, an ambitious young Basque spot in Manhattan’s East Village. “You mean we all have to get the same thing?” Indeed, the same thing. There are no real choices, not in the back room of this pintxos bar. And therein lies the problem. While guests in the front room get to select from a stunning array of affordable hors d’oeuvres and preserved fish, the three of us ended up staring at an expensive incongruity: three separate plates of the same shareable rustic dish — lamb sausage with lamb leg.\n  ', 'Sometimes, lack of choice ends up working against the consumer. This is one of those times. It’s unfortunate when the spendiest experience at any restaurant — the prix fixe is $55 — is the least inspired experience. But the good news is that the a la carte half of Huertas is a smoky, sexy, wood-fired affair that shows off the ample talents of two Danny Meyer vets: Jonah Miller, formerly a chef at Maialino, and Nate Adler, an ex-beverage director at Blue Smoke.', 'Chistorra lamb sausage with seared leg of lamb', 'The concept of the front room is simple: You sit down and waiters start bringing out food, a dim-sum-style of dining evocative of San Francisco’s State Bird Provisions or New York’s Ma Peche. Like what you see? Order it. The duck croquettes, crispy on the outside and as pillowy as a meatball within, are essentially the red meat equivalents of a chicken McNugget. Don’t like what you see? Order it anyway — the seafood-heavy fare really can’t be faulted. And to round out the meal a printed menu offers more substantial dishes and well-priced cured meats — Iberico is just $6!', '""That the power of persuasion, when applied smartly, can focus the diner on what’s important in a wine.""', 'Then there’s Adler, who’ll want to pour you a copper-colored Amontillado. ""The beautiful thing about this sherry"" he says, ""is that it tastes of the sea,"" a confusing statement for a beverage that’s not a dirty martini. Trust him. The fortified wine smells of burnt sugar and looks like a glass of dessert, though it’s dry on the palate, with a concentrated nuttiness to match the acorn aromas of good Iberico. Then it happens. That wave of salinity hits. It\'s a good reminder that the power of persuasion, when applied smartly, can focus the diner on what’s important in a wine.', 'Sous-vide heritage pork shoulder', 'It’s this type of high-grade competence that makes Huertas a fine addition to New York’s diverse Iberian culinary scene, whose best members include the haute-Portuguese Aldea, the Sephardic and Moorish-inclined La Vara, the pan-regional Toro, and of course the ham-heavy Tertulia. I say mostly because Huertas needs to fix or eliminate its no-choice prix-fixe menu.', 'No choice or low-choice affairs have largely been confined to longer tastings at cutting-edge venues like Elizabeth or Benu. In exchange for this submission to the will of the chef, diners get to sample more dishes than they would have otherwise.', ""But at Huertas, the opportunity cost of committing to five courses is missing out on 25 or so dishes in the tapas bar — not to mention all the passed plates and daily specials. That’s not to say a shorter no-choice menu doesn’t work every now and then; budget gourmet restaurants like Le Chateubriand\xa0\xa0in Paris\xa0(€65) or Contra on Manhattan’s Lower East Side ($55) make good cases for this format, because they serve visually stunning and boundary-pushing fare worthy of discussion. Huertas doesn’t. That's not a criticism. Despite Miller's penchant for sous-viding his meats, Huertas' delicious fare has a rustic-leaning feel to it, a style that's more conducive to sharing than individually composed plates."", 'Above: Raw scallops with summer squash, olive tapenade, and Sun Gold tomatoes; Left: Fideos with cockles and chorizo; Right: Pinxtos', 'A slow cooked egg with broccoli and cauliflower cream is fine for a single bite, but it’s a veritable snoozer when each member of your party has an entire plate of it to finish. Better is the a la carte version, with thicker slices of toasted bread, ready to soak up the juices of a fried egg and chorizo. Luckily, Huertas will gladly substitute that version on the prix-fixe upon request, or let you supplement the set menu with anything from the more satisfying tapas menu.', ""Too bad there’s no logical substitute for the fideos with cockles, a vermicelli preparation that doubles as a reminder that many other restaurants do an entirely better version of pasta with clams; Miller's sub-par preparation lacks any detectable brine."", 'Pros will take a seat at the tapas bar and order any of the canned fish selections from Northern Spain*, like oily sardines or scallops with concentrated tomato; the latter’s a knockout that combines such brilliant seaside salts and earthy sugars it recalls the city’s best Manhattan seafood chowders. Pair it with a fino sherry, whose vegemite-like yeasts burst with every sip.', 'That’ll go nicely to with the octopus as well, roasted in the wood burning oven until it has the texture of marshmallow and the flavor of smoked paprika — a veritable Halloween treat for grownups. Get the Calasparra rice too, which is assaulted with mushroom stock and cooked up crispy like a paella — but at half of the cost: $14. Tortilla Española, often a room-temperature frittata, becomes at Huertas an epic terrine of soft potatoes and onions, with a runny omelet draped on top. And best of all is the potato carbonara, with the tuber cut into spaghetti-like strands and cooked in the style of al-dente pasta, drenched in egg and spicy chorizo.', 'Finish off with toasted Marcona almond ice cream and there’s your new first date staple. It’s a heck of a lot better than doing the prix-fixe with four friends, where you’re all facing four slices of almond cake for dessert, when one would’ve done just fine. Now you know: Huertas gets tapas right and set menus wrong.', '*Correction: The original version of this article incorrectly stated that Huertas cans its fish in-house. It does not. That fish is imported from Northern Spain.', 'Edit Note: Ryan Sutton awards gold stars on a scale of zero (disappointing) to four (exceptional). His colleague Robert Sietsema awards his own set of (different colored) stars. Sietsema reviewed Huertas alongside another Basque newcomer Donostia back in June. Read his three star review here.']"
315,"['', ""Informed first timers might feel a momentary disconnect when they walk into The Walrus and the Carpenter: The downpour of national praise for Renee Erickson's second restaurant—an oyster bar named for a Lewis Carroll poem about gluttony and bivalves—can cloud its modesty. This isn't a mythical destination. It's a big-hearted, 40-seat anchor for the community, and locals use it as such. While I diligently ate half of the menu, the table to the left turned twice, and the one to the right moved couples through three times over. People came in, ordered a dozen or so oysters, slurped them with a cocktail or a glass of flinty white, shared at most two compelling small plates, and then moved right along with their evenings."", 'Not that it was a hardship for two of us to settle in for 80 minutes. Erickson helped advance the now-trending approach for oyster bars to reach beyond serving simple, immaculate seafood. And whether the meal is short or long, it ought to begin with Pacific Northwest oysters, most of which are from Washington State. A staffer clad in a sky-blue shirt and denim apron stands at the marble bar, under a chandelier that recalls a coral reef, and retrieves craggy shells from wire baskets to shuck. Our mix included mild, buttery oysters from Little Skookum Barron Point, at the southern jut of Puget Sound, and steelier, brinier Blue Pools from farther north. These beauties asserted their goodness without embellishment from oniony mignonette or freshly grated horseradish.', 'Oyster platter', 'Other dishes (most of which fall under the ever-in-flux categories of ""garden"" and ""fish & shellfish"") combined more ingredients, but they pleased with the same pure directness. A few drops of rosewater brought elusive, effective perfume to a honeydew melon salad with shaved beet coins, feta, and pistachios. Vanilla oil likewise scented last-of-the-season beefsteak tomatoes.', 'Smoked trout with pickled onions and lentils; Salmon belly with nectarines and purslane; Oyster bar', 'One menu staple, sea urchin custard, was a piscine panna cotta—a disc of smooth, gently oceanic mousse contrasted with popping salmon roe and a leafy trail of chervil. Slivers of smoked trout stood their ground under a thick, candy-red crown of pickled onion and over a rich mound of lentils, walnuts, and onions enrobed in crème fraiche. Curls of fried salmon belly looked sculptural and tasted unusually lush, snarled among sharp purslane and juicy nectarine slices; cauliflower puree added earthiness.', ""Servers took orders and delivered dishes with mechanized precision. They weren't cold, and they didn't rush my friend and me, but the staff obviously understands that maintaining an allegro tempo is crucial to the restaurant's rhythm. This is an oyster bar for modern lives. The menu's mercurial nature keeps regulars engaged, and somewhere in the flurry a craving for camaraderie is deeply sated, as of course is hunger."", ""Erickson's third restaurant—launched with partners Chad Dale and Jeremy Price in 2012, two years after Walrus opened—swapped the oyster bar for a wood-burning oven. The shift in emphasis innately slows the cadence: The Whale Wins, unlike The Walrus and the Carpenter, takes a smattering of reservations nightly, and customers tend to hunker down for a fuller, more leisurely meal. Servers here don't keep the pace quite so synchronized. And the restaurant, in Seattle's community-minded Wallingford neighborhood, has a European airiness. The tables sit close together but lofty ceilings (hung with letter-shaped light fixtures that spell out HELLO HELLO), cottage-white walls, and the open hearth create a lavish sense of spaciousness."", 'Roasted clams in white wine broth', ""Small plates still dominate, though there are exceptions like a roasted half-chicken or a cote de boeuf for two for $62—two examples that also highlight how far the menu can stray from the shoreline. More to the point, Erickson and her crew take the Walrus's culinary aesthetic and push the ideas further here: Dishes are saucier, riskier, and the flavors zigzag more sharply. Whiffs of smokiness clung to a generous bowl of roasted clams on my visit. Corn, onion, and butter sweetened their white wine broth, with shiso lending its minty mystery. Dill was strewn atop like seaweed washed ashore. A shimmery eggplant puree cushioned a fetching hill of beans—chickpeas, white beans, and pole beans, with corn adding texture and a dusting of parmesan to animate the earthy flavors."", ""The Walrus's national reputation may overshadow the Whale's, but each has its own secure, winning personality."", ""The Pacific Northwest is the only place where I'm overly excited about eating salmon these days, and the Whale's taut hunk of cured and smoked fish did not disappoint. It perched atop lentils mingled with chanterelle mushrooms, gently roasted tomatoes, and, for some astute sweetness, table grapes. A few leaves of tarragon lightened the dish with their licorice nip. The kitchen employed uncommon shrewdness with herbs in general: Clumps of parsley brightened sardines on toast slathered with curried tomato mayo (wonderful alongside the restaurant's standout pickle plate), mint brought extra zing to lamb tartare with preserved lemon and capers, and a handful of mixed herbs took the high notes in a tomato salad atop of romesco-like sauce of pureed peppers and walnuts. Even when a dish stumbled—as with a funky, muddy-tasting nectarine soup that cilantro pesto couldn't uplift—the intelligence behind the cooking was obvious."", ""This isn't, then, so much a case of sibling rivalry. The Walrus's national reputation may overshadow the Whale's, but each has its own secure, winning personality. It sounds ideal to begin at the Walrus around twilight for oysters and then drive the 2.3 miles over to Whale to finish the night. If I could only choose one, I'd probably lean toward the Whale—but then I'm drawn to the complicated. Wiser souls might argue credibly for simplicity."", ""Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

The resulting blackened, lacy edge compels more than even the scorched edges of a molten lasagna.', 'Deep-dish has its naysayers, but one advantage is that it can handle a profusion of toppings: Piling on the sausage and garlic and green peppers gives credence to pizza aficionado Ed Levine\'s definition of deep-dish as a ""casserole."" Honestly, a plain pie with extra cheese proved most rewarding in texture, the swampy core buoyed by sturdy crust and the crisp, cheesy exterior. One warning: The staff likely won\'t bother to mention that a large pizza can take almost an hour to bake. The wait rewards, though appetizers like jalapeno poppers and mozzarella sticks aren\'t worth the calories to fill the time. 2207 North Clybourn Avenue, Chicago, 773-327-1512, pequodspizza.com.

317,"['\n  In Russian home cooking, the layered salad known as ""herring under a fur coat"" is often covered with a magenta mess of grated beets and mayo, looking like a Slavic version of the cake that got left out in the rain from Jimmy Webb\'s ""MacArthur Park."" At Portland\'s six-month-old Kachka, chef Bonnie Morales miniaturizes her version and tiers it with precision. Grated waxy potatoes form the base, followed by diced salt-cured herring flavored with onion and dill, carrots, beets, homemade mayonnaise (mixed with some beets for the traditional pink shock), and a crowning ring of sieved egg, the whites and yolk separated. Creamy, fresh, pungent: The tastes and textures keep melding even after portions are doled out, when the dish becomes part of the collage of sharp-flavored starters called zakushi.\n  ', ""If ever there was a moment for Russian cuisine to ascend into American mainstream culture, this is it. The curing and pickling crazes from recent years have primed our palates for northern Eurasian flavors. Affordable caviar and electric orange salmon roe are now ubiquitous garnishes on restaurant plates. And who doesn't want to spend a few happy moments with a bowl of silken dumplings?"", ""Morales and her husband, Israel, welcome guests to the Russian table with persuasive hospitality. Bonnie (her maiden name is Frumkin) grew up outside of Chicago, eating variations of the Belarusian foods she now prepares at Kachka. She met Israel at Chicago's Tru, where he helped lead the front-of-house team to its Outstanding Service Award win from the James Beard Foundation in 2007. Bonnie had trained at the Culinary Institute of America but didn't give her mother's Belarusian dishes much professional consideration until Israel became smitten with them. The couple moved to Portland in part to be closer to Bonnie's brother, and they'd been planning to open Russian restaurant since they arrived."", '""Herring under a fur coat""', ""Given the close ties, it doesn't surprise how familial the dining room feels. Bonnie's mother helped pick out the brownish diamond-patterned wallpaper to match her childhood home near Minsk. Notice the cuckoo clock, a must-have ornament in mid-century USSR households. Soviet propaganda posters hang in a montage, as do decorative green window shutters meant to evoke a country house. (To understand how these seemingly disparate objects meld into a cohesive culture of Russian nostalgia, read Anya Von Bremzen's Mastering the Art of Soviet Cooking.)"", ""The setting certainly kindles a thirst for vodka. Israel Morales enables with a list of nearly 70 fire waters. I've been so swept up into our cocktail renaissance, with its emphasis on gins and darker spirits, that it was fascinating to home in vodka's subtleties and sip a premium brand like Slovenia, which seesawed from smoky to sweet to medicinal and back again. And the infused vodkas — in flavors like horseradish, tarragon, and cucumber-lime — are dangerously easy to swig. A goodly number of taxi drivers in Portland are Russian; they'll be understanding."", 'Clockwise from upper right: Caviar with blini and sieved egg, fish board, Cholodetz, smoked fish on pumpernickel', ""Drinking is inseparable from eating in these circles. Eight varieties of caviar run the gamut from $12 for house-cured king salmon roe to $225 for Tsar Nicoulai Golden Reserve, with other prices spread evenly between. It's worth ordering whichever one fits your budget for the pleasure of whole presentation, which includes cumulus-light blini, slices of challah, and tidy rows of egg and minced chive. I can vouch for the $55 white sturgeon option, which I could have shoveled in by the tablespoonful. A selection of fish poses trout, mackerel, Chinook salmon in various smoked and cured guises; gently sweet pumpernickel bread on the platter helps subdue pungent cod liver pashtet (pâté). Ready to go all in? Order the cholodetz, a molded terrine of jellied beef shank and veal feet with a sinus-jangling swipe of mustard alongside. Once I moved past the aspic-like bounciness, it grew on me. A glug of horseradish vodka helped."", 'Siberian pelmeni — six-sided dumplings stuffed with beef, veal, pork, and onion and steamed — brought the whole meal into soothing focus. The optional ""fancy broth"" for the dumplings (a must) is made from simmering collagen-rich cuts of meat. It blended with a healthy dollop of smetana (a delicate sour cream) into a savory custard that enveloped the pelmeni while echoing their beefy brawn. The stroganoff achieved a similar harmony of meat and soured cream, and the use of beef tongue rescued the dish from its purgatory as a kitchen set piece on Mad Men. Chicken Kiev, another last-century American dinner party relic, made of a breaded cutlet folded around butter and fried, resembled a Nerf football in size and density. Its heaviness made me miss the light touch employed in the rest of the dishes.', 'For dessert, I gladly returned to dumplings: vareniki, a Ukrainian specialty filled with cherries, pan-fried, and gilded with more smetana. Morales uses Oregon sour cherries in the recipe, the only overt reference to local foods on the menu. Not that she needs to add others. Portland clearly supports restaurants that mine under-explored jewels among global cuisines, and the city has a new diamond in Kachka.', ""Restaurant Editor Bill Addison is traveling to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

319,"[""Breathing in the brawny, smoky aroma when walking into Ox almost feels nourishing: It's as if vaporized meat molecules have fused with oxygen and the air itself begins to satisfy carnivorous urges. Which works out well, since the restaurant doesn't take reservations for less than six people and waits can stretch to over an hour. Greg Denton and his wife, Gabrielle Quiñónez Denton, have cooked in a kaleidoscope of restaurants across the country together and separately. For their own venture, which opened in April 2012, they nailed an approach that Portlanders immediately endorsed: the multicultural steakhouse."", ""Taking cues from Argentine grilling traditions and Gabrielle's Ecuadoran roots, the restaurant's centerpiece is a fire-breathing hearth fitted with crank wheels that can raise or lower two grills to regulate heat. Cooks plant themselves in front of the thermal blast, basting grass-fed Uruguayan beef ribeye, robust skirt steak, supple beef short ribs, and lamb shoulder chops with seasoned meat drippings. To sample of the full measure of the grill's power, share the Asado Argentino for two or more. It includes short rib, skirt steak, and chorizo but also throws in sweetbreads, grilled so the exteriors are golden with char but the interior remains creamy, and a version of blood sausage made to convert the doubters: The addition of grown walnuts along with rice ameliorates the pudding-like texture that can be unsettling, and nutmeg and cumin infuse it with flavor at once familiar and exotic."", 'Above: Asado Argentino; Left: Clam chowder with smoked bone marrow; Right: Braised tripe with octopus and mint aioli', 'One can start with a shareable spread of seafood preparations (shrimp ceviche, Dungeness crab, octopus poke), but this is really a place to reach beyond variations on classic chophouse tropes. Go bold, instead, with surf-and-turf mindbenders like clam chowder revved by smoked marrow bone or a cauldron of beef tripe and octopus cut with mint aioli. Ease up on the calories when choosing substantial sides —caramelized cauliflower in a bright, clever vinaigrette spiked with golden raisins, mint, and peanuts stands out — and then double back to decadence with sweets like cream cheese panna cotta offset with hot apple fritters.', 'The less adventurous can nibble on empanadas filled with Gruyere and sweet potatoes or avocado-crab toast before the beefy blitz. But what has made Ox a national destination in short order is the uncanny symmetry that the Dentons achieve: the primal savor of grilled meats bracketed by brainy, ballsy, dare-you-to-try them dishes with serious payoff.', '""This sounds strange,"" said my Portlander friend, referring to a pasta dish that incorporated strawberry, turnip, and parmesan. ""We should order it."" Strange often equals exceptional in the world of chef-owner Gabriel Rucker, who revamped a flailing bistro into Le Pigeon in 2006 and became one of Portland\'s most lionized chefs. True to form, the ""Pigeon noodles"" improbably wowed: The strawberries and turnips merged into a brain-jangling chutney that mellowed the fruit\'s sour-sweetness and vegetable\'s grassy-earthiness. Black pepper and scallions helped push the flavors in a savory direction. Parmesan smoothed the flavors. And in place of the breadcrumbs that Italians might use for crunch, the kitchen subbed in — boom! \xa0— crumbled instant ramen noodles punched up with seasonings from a barbecue flavor packet.', 'Chicken and oxtail with gnocchi and taleggio', ""Not every act of imagination sent from Rucker's stoves involved such high-low zingers, but the cooking certainly held our attention the whole night. A velvety saffron sauce worked crowd hypnosis over sashimi-grade fluke, cantaloupe, and avocado, drawing them together with its enigmatic perfume. The French classic sole Veronique received an autumnal makeover, with snowy medallions of steamed fish surrounded by herbed brown butter and punctuated by black-skinned Venus grapes and dots of celery root puree. Chicken rubbed with a peppery Montreal smoked meat spice blend was draped over oxtail meat, semolina gnocchi formed into a rectangle and fried, and a few green beans. The kicker on this entree? A gloss of melted taleggio, which gave the whole thing a wacky, retro-fun vibe that recalled 1990s experimentations."", 'Le Pigeon is a snug restaurant, and the tone of the food encourages communication between tables (though the best seats in the house are at the bar built around the open kitchen). The couple next to us noticed our baroque foie gras appetizer — two lobes of terrine spiced with vadouvan curry decorated with drizzles of marjoram honey and ""ratatouille escabeche"" (vegetables like zucchini and eggplant cooked and then pickled) — and requested their own. They shot looks of concern when liver reappeared at dessert time in the signature profiteroles with foie gras ice cream. Half the parties in the restaurant seemed to have ordered the restaurant\'s other trademark, beef cheek Bourguignon over sour cream and chive mashed potatoes. (The dish leaned salty.) That the dining room was filled with customers embracing offal and barbecue-flavored ramen noodles for garnish said as much about Portland\'s exceptionally progressive attitude toward food as it did about Rucker\'s nervy brilliance.', 'Maurice — prim in its tiny, bridal-shop white interior — is the antithesis of Ox but just as magnetic in its own eccentric way. Pastry chef Kristen Murray structured her storefront to serve the community in many guises, including as a lunch-hour hideaway, a stopover for fika (the Swedish notion of a leisurely coffee break), a happy hour hangout with an edifying selection of vermouth, and an all-day source for meticulous desserts.', 'Lefse with gravlax and salmon roe', ""I scanned the handwritten menu, looked at the antique coffee pots and other country-home tchotchkes on shelves, and wondered if this all might be a tad too precious. Then the food started arriving. Lefse, a Norwegian potato flatbread based on a recipe from Murray's grandmother, had the texture of a thick crepe. A line of gravlax, salmon roe, crème fraîche, and dill fronds stretched over its mottled surface. It was precise and delicious. Hunks of pale but juicy melon and last-of-the-season tomatoes topped with shaved aged goat cheese played off of each other without any one ingredient upstaging. A cloud of polenta clafoutis (so smart to turn the French baked pancake savory) floated down to earth with its accompanying sauté of meaty mushrooms. Smorrebrod, the Scandinavian open-faced sandwich, came piled with shrimp salad, shaved cucumber, and avocado. Its freshness and exacting assembly hoisted it above standard bridge club fare."", ""The food's lightness leaves plenty of mental and physical space for dessert. I came in for a late lunch and kept jumping up to examine the pastry case, asking our server to set aside the last orders of beauties like black pepper cheesecake set on a honey rye graham cookie and topped with a gooseberry anchored by fig preserves. Lemon souffle pudding cake arrived in a haze of powdered sugar, teetering between solid and custard, sugary and citrusy."", 'Left: Shrimp, avocado, and cucumber smorrebrod; Right: Melon and tomato salad with aged goat cheese; Bottom: Black pepper cheesecake', ""Too few pastry chefs get the chance to build their own stage and show off the breadth of their culinary strengths. Murray is an articulate cook with both sweets and savories.

320,"['\n  When I joined my fellow Eater critics Ryan Sutton and Robert Sietsema at  La Grenouille  for dinner in May, we dined on pike quenelles, grilled Dover sole, and Grand Marnier soufflés. We\'d chosen the 1950s fine-dining survivor out of curiosity for the relevance of such haute French dishes: Were they timeless or anachronistic? Each of us had enjoyed the meal more than we expected, and at the end of dinner I asked, ""What\'s the modern New York equivalent of this place?""\n  ', '""Carbone,"" Sutton said immediately. Devotees of Torrisi Italian Specialties and Parm stampeded Carbone when it opened last March, frantic to bask in the midcentury red-sauce swankness reimagined by Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi, and Jeff Zalaznick. ""I\'m suspicious that it\'s a fake,"" said Sietsema. ""The prospect of eating Italian-American food in a restaurant that costs threefold over, say, Bamonte\'s or Frost in Williamsburg doesn\'t appeal."" Sutton countered: ""It\'s a refined version of the Italian-American food I grew up eating on Long Island. I dig it.""', 'Which is how we found ourselves recently together again, shouting to be heard while Dean Martin\'s voice bounced overhead and our slicked-haired server in a burgundy tux flambéed bananas Foster for a nearby party of ten. The trippy quality of Carbone\'s interior is a portal to Little Italy in a parallel, cinematic universe. A scene in The Godfather inspired the black-and-white patterned floor. The walls are the otherworldly blue of Mystique\'s skin in the X-Men movies. Film director Julian Schnabel\'s son, Vito, organized the art on the walls: Irreverent images of Michelangelo-like busts with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths, or pictures scrawled with aphorisms such as ""A black-out is nature\'s way of sparing me the embarrassment,"" are the only overt visual clues that an archetype is being toyed with.', ""The tinkering in most cases is triumphant. What's particularly fun about Carbone is that it doesn't simply pay homage to the red-sauce palaces that simmered their way into popular culture fifty years ago. It also winks at midcentury Continental cuisine and explores the ways the two genres overlapped. Gigantic, pricy, nuanced versions of Italian-American standards populate the menu: baked clams, minestrone, lobster Fra Diavolo, veal Marsala. But a retro Palm Springs coolness informs the meal, too. Cocktail clichés get chic makeovers. Chartreuse gives the rum daiquiri a femme-fatale edge; whiffs of rosemary turns a potent Gibson martini into a harbinger of the herb-rich dishes soon to fill the table."", 'In his thick, Old-World baritone, the server confirms our order and then brings out pre-dinner snacks, including stalactites of Parmesan and logs of delightfully oily ""Grandma bread"" painted with thin, clingy tomato sauce and oregano. Much of the food substantiates Sutton\'s praise. Baked clams in three variations begin playfully (oreganata-style with fluffy, herbaceous bread crumbs) and then go luxe, with lardo subbing for bacon on the ""casino"" variation and the third riff topped with sweet uni. Rigatoni has an appealing slipperiness that verges on gluey—a quirky quality that separates Italian-American pastas from the homeland. It comes in a tomato-vodka sauce with chile to magnify the subtle heat from the spirit. Mario Carbone crisscrosses Italian and Continental with his Ribeye Diana, a lofty spin on steak Diane in a jus that hints of cacciatore with pancetta, rosemary, and tomato paste. Warm, crisp-soft croutons complete a silky, piquant Caesar salad.', ""A couple of misses threaten to disrupt the restaurant's silver screen dreaminess. We each disparage the plate-size veal parmesan—the meat under a luxurious gloss of cheese and sauce is undeniably bland. Gemelli DiMaggio, named of course for the legendary baseball player, uses frilly west coast Dungeness crab (Joe DiMaggio hailed from San Francisco). At this time of year, though, East Coast blue crab is at its sweetness: Why not rename the dish and use it instead? The ending saves the show. The flames surge for our own bananas Foster, ginger icing nudges carrot cake into an exotic realm, and we sip limoncello and grappa brought to the table as part of the meal's conclusion. Two of us leave convinced, the third validated."", ""I was prepared to be nonplussed by Carbone, if not actively hate it. I'd witnessed firsthand (from my vantage point at the sushi joint across the street) how the place had pirated the restaurant sign of the former tenant, Rocco, which had been a landmark on Thompson Street for almost a century. And Carbone's demeanor seemed actively snotty, at least from the accounts I'd read."", ""But the restaurant's cramped and antique feel charmed me. The staff was freaky-retro, the place smelled of parmesan cheese, and a table of eight blondes sat next to us, flirting with their server and looking like they generally do have more fun."", ""As a fan of Italian-American food, I expected Carbone's renditions to be standard—and just offered in larger size servings, the way Il Mulino had done it for decades. Was I surprised! It was not really historical Italian-American fare, but that cuisine in collision with more modern notions of Italian food (from Italy itself) with modern American ideas. What Italian-American restaurant serves a Caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes and freshly made mozzarella? Carbone does it spectacularly."", ' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBill Addison/Eater\n\n\n', ""The tableside Caesar was great, but so many places make an outstanding rendition that Carbone's didn't stand out. I can still taste the vodka rigatoni, a daringly plebian dish for Carbone to attempt. Only the tough veal parm was awful. With what had gone before, it should have been remarkable. We knocked back a spicy Rosso Conero Riserva from the Marche, a region of Italy where some provinces have D.O.C.G. designation and from where it's possible to fine a great bottle in a store at $20. Ours rang in at over $100, but it was almost worth it."", ""Carbone continues to be a place that I send out-of-towners. It's a quintessential New York restaurant you just can't find elsewhere (unless, alas, you're in Hong Kong, where the group has a second location). As I see it, every dollar an out-of-towner spends at Parm or Carbone or Torrisi is a dollar not thrown away on a tourist trap in Little Italy, at a crappy midtown steakhouse, or at Il Mulino."", ""Carbone's cooking represents something most Americans are familiar with-the huge, saucy, melty portions of Italian-American cooking—but at level of refinement, creativity, and technique that's more common for high-end French and Italian fare. This level of service and pampering is becoming relatively uncommon for an a la carte venue, though admittedly you still end up paying as much at Carbone as you do at a tasting menu restaurant: Dinner for three can easily exceed $500."", 'I don\'t buy the argument that Italian-American cuisine has to be cheap because it was born out of poverty—really, most cuisines were born out of poverty. And I like to think a victory for Carbone is also a victory for Alex Stupak\'s ambitious Mexican establishments, and every other so-called ""ethnic food"" restaurant pigeonholed into the culinary bargain bin.', ""But here's the thing: If a restaurant charges top dollar it has to render the best versions of these dishes. That was a damn fine steak Diane—it didn't taste dry-aged, but it had a gorgeous sweetness. Is the $55 veal parm the best I've had? No, not even close—though let the record state that I'm not a huge fan of chicken or veal parm in general. The flip side is that, during multiple separate visits to Carbone, I've encountered better veal Marsala than anywhere else -- and I've consumed my fair share of Marsala growing up on Long Island. Yes, the veal parm needs work. That aside, Carbone gets it right.""]"
321,"['Since the late 2000s, Nashville has been luring in the food world with a spate of new restaurants that celebrate the traditional South but also blend in chefs’ pluck and global influences. Who got the banquet rolling? The region’s food writers point to Tandy Wilson and his City House, which opened in late 2007. He previously worked for Nate Appleman, then at Tra Vigne restaurant in St. Helena, California, and Margot McCormack, a Nashville chef who leans to French and Italian cooking but was also an early adaptor of the locavore credo. Wilson found his own space in a former artist’s studio on a quiet stretch in the city’s Germantown neighborhood. His first menus skewed Italian—charcuterie, pastas, pizzas—but soon wove in more and more Southern influences.', 'City House exterior, Pole bean salad with pickle dressing, Pizza with buttermilk cottage cheese and delicata squash', 'Now Wilson’s kitchen turns out best-of-both-world twists like a take on frico, the Italian parmesan crisp. This one uses potato as a textural base, with a Tennessee cheddar made of buttermilk broiled into a golden, crinkly layer of molten debauchery. Seasonal salads provide the caloric antidote. An early fall spread included pole beans and field peas with red onions and pickle dressing (the dirty martini as vinaigrette); half-moon zucchini slivers in tomato dressing with crunchy bits of bread somewhere in size between crumbs and croutons; and a simple, striking presentation of grilled octopus on a bed of cucumber slices with pickled chiles and mint.', 'Pastas arrived covered in webs of melting pecorino strands. Gnocchi fashioned from cornmeal startled at first: The chew was denser than normal, but I came to appreciate their affinity for the dumplings simmered with greens in the South. Rigatoni with lamb looked more squarely to the Mediterranean, with blasts of cinnamon and black pepper that recalled the Arab influences in Southern Italian cuisines. Tangy cottage cheese made from buttermilk provided a novel base for pizza, matched with shards of delicata squash for contrasting sweetness and red onion for sharpness.', 'Most winning among the entrees was catfish encased in toothy cornmeal crust, scattered with field peas, and lit up with lemon conserva and garlic. If the restaurant’s cross-current style sounds appealing, consider Wilson’s next-level Sunday Supper, when the kitchen truly lets it rip with earthy enticements like scrapple, trotter soup, tripe stew, and pizza topped with ricotta and okra.', 'The last time I ate at the Capitol Grille in the Hermitage Hotel, a columned Beaux Arts building constructed in 1867, Sean Brock was in the kitchen. It was early 2006, and Brock, only 27 years-old, was deep into a molecular gastronomy phase. His modernist tasting menu was separate from the restaurant’s standard menu and could be requested only through Brock’s personal blog. Out came courses like sous-vide lobster on strips of cara cara orange peel (a server poured over hot water to release their fragrance) and pork belly steeping in wood smoke under glass. Gellan gum was used wantonly.', 'Georgia quail with pureed pumpkin', 'Brock departed soon after for McCrady’s in Charleston—and of course seven years later he circled back to Nashville with the second location of Husk—but few chefs had attempted modernist cuisine in the South. His then-psychedelic meal among the hotel’s grand arches and butterscotch lighting stayed with me.', ' Brown helps tend both the farm’s organic garden and a herd of Red Poll cattle that supplies the Capitol Grille with beef.', 'In keeping with the more recent Southern food renaissance, Tyler Brown, Capitol Grille’s current chef, channels his ingenuity into the land. In 2012 the hotel purchased 250 acres of countryside, which it named Double H Farms. Brown helps tend both the farm’s organic garden and a herd of Red Poll cattle that supplies the Capitol Grille with beef. His menu is necessarily broad in the way of most hotel restaurants (the style is billed as ""Southern steakhouse""), but he and his team bring finesse to dishes like an herbaceous salad of corn, charred cauliflower, and cherry tomatoes at their bursting peak, or meaty quail with cranberries and pumpkin puree.', 'Southern food maestro John T. Edge turned me onto the Capitol Grille’s truest glory: sausage and biscuits at breakfast. The buttermilk biscuits—fluffy but not flimsy and with golden, buttery crowns—are textbook. But the meat transcends easy labels. It’s a variation known as ""sock sausage,"" in which cooked ground pork seasoned with sage and chile flakes ages briefly in muslin before smoking under low heat for seven days. Tyler developed the recipe with the late Southern food and social justice writer John Egerton, and he serves the sausage sandwiched between biscuit halves in gravy laced with mustard to complement the piquant, campfire flavors. It beats the hell out of chicken and waffles.', 'Before diving into Nashville’s buzzy dining scene at dinner, have lunch at one of its institutions. Jack Arnold bought the meat-and-three (as in, a cafeteria-style restaurant where diners typically order a plate that includes a protein and three side dishes) where he was employed in 1987 and grew it into the populist destination it is today. Arnold’s wife Rose and son Kahlil now largely preside over the place.', ""Roast beef, vegetable plate, yeast rolls, and peach pie, Arnold's exterior, Arnold's interior"", 'A Nashville friend suggested a rendezvous at 11 a.m.; I wondered why so early until I saw the trail of people winding into the parking lot by 11:30. By then we’d already moved through the line, our red trays crowded with plates. Pepper roast beef carved to order is the house specialty, as are the don’t-miss turnip greens simmered with ham hock. Other menu items like fried catfish, meatloaf, liver and onions, fried green tomatoes, and creamed corn rotate through the week. The old Southern yarn that ""mac-and-cheese is a vegetable"" definitely applies here. Plush yeast rolls will tempt, but cornmeal hoe cakes flipped fresh on the griddle evoke an even stronger sense of place.', 'Wisely, the restaurant positions desserts at the front of the line so you’ll nab one hungrily before you get to the savories. Peach pie featured ripe, end-of-the-season fruit, but its billowy white garnish wasn’t whipped cream.

Follow his progress in this travelogue/review series, The Road to the 38, and check back at the end of the year to find out which restaurants made the cut.\n  "", '\nPhiladelphia has done right by\xa0transplant\xa0Eli Kulp. He was chef de cuisine at Manhattan\'s empire-spawning Torrisi Italian Specialties before being recruited in 2012 by\xa0Ellen Yin, who openedFork in 1997. The restaurant is often credited as sparking the dining boom in Philly\'s Old City district, but bringing in Kulp and his brainy Italian cooking pushed Fork into the national limelight like never before.\nAmong across-the-board local accolades, Kulp was also named one of\xa0Food & Wine\'s Best New Chefs 2014 in April. Since his arrival, he and Yin revamped her next-door cafe Fork Etc intoHigh Street on Market, which serves food throughout the day. The duo\'s newly formed High Street Hospitality Group also overhauled menus this year for A.Kitchen and A.Bar in the AKA Rittenhouse Square hotel.\nTo explore the cult of Kulp, I started with lunch at High Street and returned the same day for dinner at Fork.\nHIGH STREET ON MARKET\nSouthern bakers should have come up with this first. High Street\'s red eye danish reconfigures one of Dixie\'s classic breakfasts—country ham in a simple pan sauce jolted with coffee. Laminated dough winds around a creamed gravy center with porky undertones and a java kick and then receives a coiled crown of Benton\'s ham. A final sprinkle of Gruyere hints at the flavors of a ham and cheese croissant. Genius.\nThe pastry is a window into Kulp\'s approach: He\'s drawn to reimagining culinary touchstones. Jewish deli cuisine, for example, gets nods throughout the restaurant\'s various menus. At breakfast, a misshapen bialy come scattered with morsels of whitefish and pickled red peppers. The roll is dyed dark as midnight with squid ink, with scatterings of black and white sesame seeds to further stress the color scheme. On the dinner menu, deli fare goes Italian in a winking concoction of caraway rye rigatoni tossed in a pastrami ragu and dabs of oil infused with mustard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed eye danish;\xa0Duck meatball sandwich; Pastrami sandwich\nAt lunch, the restaurant\'s most straightforward meal, the interpretation is transparent: a walloping pastrami sandwich on rye with cabbage slaw, Russian dressing, and a slathering of yellow mustard. In terms of excellence, it beat a basic, satisfying grilled cheese oozing cheddar lava between slices of roasted potato bread, but the pastrami number couldn\'t best the outstanding duck meatball sandwich. Kulp rejiggers the Italian-American standard by simmering the meatballs in tomato sauce, slicking the semolina hoagie roll with liver mousse, and sealing in the ingredients with barely melted Swiss cheese.\nHigh Street (the old name for Market Street, one of the city\'s main thoroughfares) is all about the bready pleasures. Even if you order a sandwich, consider doubling down with the $4 bread service, worth it for thick, chewy slices of anadama rich with cornmeal and rye. Or lighten the meal with vegetable revelries like the grilled broccoli salad (complex with blistered grapes, endive, and Marcona almonds) and easy-to-like sides such as roasted carrots with ginger and currants. For a fuller measure of Kulp\'s strengths I\'d return next time for dinner. 308 Market Street, Philadelphia, 215-625-0988, website, Open for breakfast Monday - Friday, 7 - 11:30 a.m., Saturday - Sunday 8 a.m.-3:30 p.m.; lunch daily 11:30 a.m. - 3:30 p.m.; and dinner Tuesday - Thursday and Sunday 5:30 - 10 p.m., Friday - Saturday 5:30-10:30 p.m.\nFORK\nOur duck had already seen quite a journey before it was presented tableside with a bouquet flowering from its derriere. The carcass had been hung and dried, Peking style, for a week before an air compressor inflated the space between its skin and flesh. It was then boiled in a vinegar mixture, dredged with baking powder, and basted with maltose over several days to achieve a glossy lacquer.\n \n\nFork lays out several routes for approaching a meal.\n\nWe would soon be relishing the efforts in several forms. Roasted breast presented austerely on a round wooden platter, sauced with only drizzles of almond puree and dustings of Sichuan peppercorns—the better to savor the crackly skin and rosy meat without other flavor distractions. Sliced heart, as well as bits of leg and thigh skin and duck pastrami (previously prepared), arrayed over a refreshing salad that included celery leaves and baby artichokes. And for the finale: two fist-size orbs of ground leg meat bound with cream-drenched bread and pecorino, deep-fried, and finally braised in tomato agrodolce enhanced with liver and plenty of black pepper. Kulp and his crew can clearly do no wrong with duck meatballs.\nThe bird feast, bridging the cuisines of China and Italy, whirled us through the five taste senses and an extravagance of textures. And it was but one aspect of our dinner. Fork lays out several routes for approaching a meal: One can order a standard format of starters ($14 to $18), pastas (available in half-portions for $16 to $19 or full for $26 to $29) and mains ($28 to $48). Compose a four-course meal from the a la carte choices and dessert for $70 per person. Or hand over the decisions entirely to the kitchen with the lengthier $95 tasting menu, which includes dishes created solely for this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuck salad; Fluke draped over buckwheat; Whole duck\nOur table strode the middle path with the four-courser, incorporating the duck (a frequent special meant for two) as part of our entrees. So many chefs concentrate their artistry into appetizers and peter out at entrees, but this meal only gained momentum. The starters were captivating enough: fluke sashimi cured with kombu, pounded like carpaccio, and draped over a curved buckwheat cracker like ghostly moss spreading across a rock. A rhubarb consommé that was refreshing and astringent but could have also used a sweet accent from strawberry. Pastas showed off the kitchen\'s prowess, with beauties like freeform lasagna noodles slinking over molten puddles of washed-rind cheese with scattered hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and porcini powder.\nThe duck stole the night, though it had a worthy sidekick in branzino presented ""en croute"" by fusing the fish with a plank of pan de mie (baked at High Street next door, of course, as were other tempting breads) and serving it in a nicely acidic tamarind broth. Pastry chef and Eater Young Guns 2014 class member Sam Kincaid helped the evening finish strong with summery desserts that were intricate yet came together on the palate—a study of corn that included whiskey sabayon, sweet corn ice cream, roasted blueberries, and locally grown popcorn, and a gorgeous little tart filled with berry jam and brown butter custard that sidled up to local plums and berry sorbet.\nThis is indeed a restaurant restored. 306 Market Street, Philadelphia, 215-625-9425, website, Open for lunch Wednesday - Friday 11:30 a.m. - 2 p.m., Sunday brunch 11 a.m. - 3 p.m., dinner Monday - Thursday 5:30 - 10:30 p.m., Saturday 5 - 10:30 p.m., Sunday 5 - 9:30 p.m.Email Bill at bill@eater.com and follow him at @BillAddison.\n \nPhotography: [Bill Addison]\n', ""Philadelphia has done right by\xa0transplant\xa0Eli Kulp.

Follow his progress in this travelogue/review series, The Road to the 38, and check back at the end of the year to find out which restaurants made the cut."", '""Would you like to reserve a table or seats at the bar?"" asked a staffer over the phone. ""A table?"" I guessed, which was the wrong answer. The joie de vivre at Hotel Herman centers around its U-shaped, laboratory-white bar, which seats 18 and dominates the space. This isn\'t any sort of guesthouse but one of Montreal\'s most progressive neighborhood restaurants. It would be a worth a swing-by just to sit among the diverse, effervescent clientele and glean some quick cultural insights. The French Canadians in the mix, for example, often scrutinized the menu and held serious deliberations before ordering. The English speakers tended to wave a nonchalant hand over the list and request the first dishes that popped out at them. ', 'Either approach leads to the same rewards. Chef/co-owner (and Eater Young Gun) Marc-Alexandre Mercier composes light, New Nordic-influenced small plates scattered with artful lettuces and flowers, but the flavors mine unexpected depths. Razor clams hide under a lush garden of diced cucumber, milkweed flowers, black bread crumbled and dyed with squid ink (aka the soil effect, used winningly here) and dots of aioli that help bind the flavors. Creamy celery root puree anchors pale, sweet shrimp; celery root shavings on top are sprinkled with powdered dulce, which resembles black pepper. A sauce made from unfiltered honey tames the peppery bite of radishes cut in several fetching shapes. Bits of lamb belly, cured like bacon, season both hunks of lamb shoulders and the English peas rolling around the plate. ', '', 'Razor clams with black bread soil; Grilled zucchini with caviar', ""Given the kitchen's leanings, it's no surprise to find a wine list full of small-production, biodynamic wines from France and Germany; the bilingual staff is swift with smart recommendations. Many of Montreal's most renowned restaurants wallow in the glory of fatty meats and sustaining starches. For a departure from the richness, Hotel Herman is a choice destination. 5171 Rue Saint-Laurent, Montreal, 514-278-7000, website; Open for dinner Wednesday-Monday 5 p.m.-midnight. (Closed Tuesday.)"", ""And now back to the Montreal of the imagination. For an immersion into the city's vital Frenchness, step into this 34-year-old institution on shop-lined Rue Saint-Denis. The zinc bar lined with mirrors, the burgundy walls, the black and white checkered tiles: L'Express couldn't be more of a true, classic bistro. The menu of dishes like veal kidney in mustard sauce, chicken liver pâté with pistachios, and cold roast beef with salad or fries makes it clear that this is no Disney personification. So does the crisp service, friendly only to the point of professionalism."", 'The food is not designed for thrills and revelations. It is honest bistro cooking that sets a spectacular sense of place. Settle into a sturdy chair or a swiveling, fire engine-red barstool. Submerge a spoon into wonderfully murky fish soup, swirling in the dollop of aioli extra-potent with garlic, and drop in a shard of crusty cheese toast for good measure. Swat off the small petals of cabbage atop the hunks of bone marrow and spread the unctuous goodness inside over slices of toasted baguette.', 'Bone marrow', ""Every dish delivers these kinds of earthy, grounding savor. Tarragon's licorice zap cuts through calf's liver blackened with a gutsy sear; the fries piled on the plate are middling, but they still satisfy when swiped through the sinus-clearing mustard served alongside. Grilled cobia makes a pitch-perfect light lunch, drizzled with olive oil and served with haricot vert, halved cherry tomatoes, and boiled potatoes. For dessert, sidestep the floating islands for more basic pleasures, such as a prim lemon tart or the baba au rum speckled with boozy currants. "", ""In most regards L'Express embodies the dignity of the everyday bistro. Its one extraordinary quality is its wine list, a rotating tome of priced-to-move options that draws from a cellar stocked with over 11,000 bottles. Manager and wine director Mario Brossoit is usually on hand to offer guidance on his finds from Burgundy, Loire, and Côte du Rhone. 3927 Rue Saint-Denis, Montreal, 514-845-5333; website; Open Monday-Friday 8 a.m.-2 a.m., Saturday 10 a.m-2 a.m., Sunday 10 a.m.-1 a.m."", 'Hof Kelsten interior; Bialy, pain au chocolat, strawberry rugelach', ""Montreal native Jeffery Finkelstein was already supplying bread to some of the city's best restaurants (including Joe Beef) when he opened his own boulangerie last year, a modern twist on the Jewish bakeries his family frequented when he was growing up.

""Do you know about your drawers?"" she asked. ""There are drawers under each place setting that contain all the flatware you\'ll need for dinner.""', 'It was but one detail about Asta that reminded me of the intimate restaurants burgeoning in Copenhagen—particularly Relae, where a Noma alum, Christian Puglisi, cooks abridged but sumptuous tasting menus, serving whimsies like a study of carrots or beef tartare with oysters and lovage. Chef Alex Crabb, who runs Asta with Parsigian, spent two months apprenticing at Noma before opening his own place and clearly absorbed some of the Danish aesthetics. He borrowed the silverware-drawer conceit from Relae, and both restaurants sport scruffy exposed brick and buffed concrete floors. But Crabb and Parsigian also threw in some American quirkiness for their spare, 41-seat room. Spray-painted birds and bunnies flit on the walls of the restroom hallway, and they left an image of Zeus, hoisting a lightening bolt, etched by previous occupants and uncovered during renovation.', 'Mussels and potatoes; Monkfish with garlic scape; Duck and onions with beer-cheese sauce', ""Crabb also worked at Boston's starry L'Espalier for five years, and his food is a rewarding sum of his experiences. He offers three tasting menus for dinner, each tailored to different appetites: a $45 three-course meal full of comforts like deviled eggs, braised lamb or duck confit, and coconut cream pie. The five-course $70 option veers more to the conceptual, a polished sequence of dishes fully in Crabb's repertoire, heavy on au courant vegetables. The eight-course $95 prix fixe is for the open minded, a chance to taste ideas in progress and notions, like beef heart with potatoes and whey, culled from the New Nordic lexicon. Obligingly, a group can order any combination of menus."", ""Asta opened in January 2013, and Boston's critics lauded Crabb as one of the city's most promising new talents in recent years. After one of his five-course progressions, I can see why. His food has bravura but isn't uptight. The meal kicked off with mussels escabeche, set in a squid ink-stained broth as black as the mollusk's (absent) shells. Small potato spheres rolled around the bowl, with a few raw turnip orbs, identical to the spuds, tossed in to playfully booby-trap the palate."", ""Parsigian is in good company on the floor with sommelier Paige Farrell, who connects Crabb's cooking with some strikingly compatible wines. For the mussels and potato dish, she poured a flinty Weingut Robert Weil Riesling. The pairings soon moved into French varietals. A fragrant, floral Domaine de Reuilly Pinot Gris Rosé from the Loire fell in with the flavors of hard-seared monkfish made earthy from black sesame puree and a grilled garlic scape lassoed around the fish. A lemony Savagnin (not Sauvignon) Blanc from the Jura counterbalanced a handsome splay of duck confit with various fresh and cooked local onions alongside a pool of beer-cheese sauce: It was Strange Brew meets Now, Forager. A Pinot Noir from Burgundy's Côte Chalonnaise brought springtime strawberry notes to the breast and leg meat from D'Artagnan's Green Circle chicken. (The birds were crazy pricy and Crabb didn't buy them for long.)"", 'Apricots over milk bread', ""All this food and drink hit the Goldilocks sweet spot: I wasn't hungry, glutted, or overly buzzed at the end of it. I was just right. Elated, in fact, by dessert: a slice of toasted cinnamon milk bread, somewhere between the texture of brioche and tea cake, topped with fresh and revived dried apricots, speckled with almonds, and bathed in vanilla bean milk. No shenanigans, no deconstruction—only simple deliciousness."", ""The restaurant, wedged between a cupcake shop and a convenience store, resides on a curious nether-block in Boston's Back Bay: It's near the hustle of swank Newbury Street but apart from it, and flanked by six-story apartment buildings.

At O Ya, what comes under that label is an expression of harmony, and one example of chef-owner Tim Cushman\'s elegant redirection of Japanese cuisine. The idea for the creation began with a piece of nigiri sushi, the rice properly warm and threaded with vinegar. Cushman, a New England native, had Maine lobsters in his kitchen and wanted to use every part of them. He thought about his childhood, when his mother would employ a rolling pin to extract the meat from the creature\'s spindly legs. They were Cushman\'s favorite part.', '""Legs and eggs""', ""To fortify the squiggly leg meat, bound to the rice by a nori ribbon, Cushman added a few grams of osetra caviar and tomalley sauce (made from the lobster's liver) for uni-like sea funk. Flurries of yuzu zest and diced chives sharpened the pitch. The result was a thumb-size masterwork, luxury minus the pretension and tasting of cultures that entwined without conflict. It cost $27 for two pieces. I'd gladly pay it again."", ""O Ya's 40 seats, half of them at a long bar, have been steadily occupied since the restaurant opened in 2007. It was an improbable debut.  The place resides in a former firehouse in the city's leather district near the waterfront. The area is clogged with commuters during the evening rush hour and then quickly falls into an otherworldly silence. Cushman, who runs O Ya with his wife, Nancy, had never owned a restaurant before, though he had worked in food for three decades. He'd become a consultant specializing in stranger-in-a-strange-land restaurants: an Italian trattoria in Hong Kong, a deep-dish pizza parlor in France, a tapas bar in London. All the cross-pollination gave him the confidence to create a menu built on Japanese cuisine (which he loved but had no formal training in) that incorporates a worldly array of flavors."", 'Kumamoto oyster with watermelon and cucumber', ""Also: Cushman is a guitarist who graduated from Boston's Berklee College of Music. The man understands structure and cadence, tension and resolution, and that comes through in his cooking. He composes in bites, so his food is more in a form resembling virtuoso pop tunes (Brian Wilson, not Katy Perry) rather than lengthy symphonies. He sears hamachi, adding smokiness to sweetness, and then layers in acidic contrast with banana pepper mousse—odd-sounding but effective. Cucumber mignonette and tiny watermelon spheres gently buoy kumamoto oysters. Pork ribs are brined in tea, the tannins standing up to the meat. Olive oil bubbles, atop diver scallops in sage-scented tempura, fade like last night's dreams before your taste buds even register them."", ""Cushman's rhapsodies can be experienced either à la carte or through omakase/tasting menus. The basic seventeen-course tasting menu starts around $185, give or take the night's ingredients, with a grander presentation of $285 for seven additional courses embellished with caviar and other rarified ingredients. Yes, the latter puts the meal's starting point somewhere between San Francisco's Saison and Los Angeles's Urasawa. In this instance, I prefer rambling through Cushman's ninety-plus à la carte possibilities. Many of the best dishes are on both menus, and I was more drawn to select what felt most enticing in the moment. Our server had a cowboy-casual demeanor, disarming for a Japanese restaurant, but he paced the meal deftly and doled out solid advice on sakes and wines by the glass. (Hint: Rieslings work well here.)"", 'Daikon dumplings; Rock shrimp kakiage', 'Two of us devoured seven riffs on nigiri and sashimi: Beyond the ""legs and eggs,"" another particular favorite was uni crowned with dashi gelee and lightened by the mysterious, vanilla-like essence of tonka bean. Daikon dumplings acted as a bridge course between sushi and cooked items: The short-lived but influential raw foods restaurant Roxanne in Larkspur, California, inspired the dish. Cushman soaked the radish in a soy marinade to soften it, folded the slices around a miso-nut puree with mild kimchee and toasted garlic, and dressed the plate with nori sauce, ginger-scallion oil, and a variation on mayo made with pine nuts. Lots going on, yet it all clicked. We enjoyed a slow-cooked onsen egg (named after the hot springs in Japan) bathed in dashi but liked it even better as part of a bowl of thin somen noodles with fried squid.', 'Yuzu curd', ""If you order foie gras nigiri, one of Cushman's signatures, there's no need for dessert. Servers know to bring the foie, painted with balsamic chocolate kabayaki (eel sauce) and capped with cocoa pulp, as a finale; a tumbler with a splash of aged sake comes alongside. Yuzu curd with spiral meringues and streaks of blackberry-jasmine sauce, while pretty, felt redundant afterward."", ""After six years focusing on their firstborn, the Cushmans are expanding to New York. In May they launched a rooftop bar in Manhattan's Park South hotel, which is undergoing renovation and is where the Cushmans plan to open a restaurant next spring. Watching Tim divide his time will be fascinating. I can't imagine how his Boston corps of cooks (including several Japanese sushi chefs behind the bar) will manage to keep the catalog of dishes straight without him; maybe he'll streamline the menus. At the moment, O Ya definitely merits a splurge. It was a meal that left me whistling a happy tune down the lonely streets outside.""]"

And it is long enough (nine plus-courses) to make the eight-month old venue feel like another manifestation of The Destination Neighborhood Restaurant, a local spot attracting, whether intentionally or not, a citywide and sometimes countrywide following. Dover\'s culinary team, Joe Ogrodnek and Walker Stern, were the only two New York delegates in Food & Wine\'s 2014 class of ""best new chefs."" Bon Appetit named sister spot Battersby the third best new U.S. restaurant for 2012. And GQ named the then three month-old Dover one of the 25 best new restaurants in America in March. Congratulations.', ""Too bad Dover isn't equipped to offer its most expensive wares to those crossing borough lines, never mind state lines. The $35 caviar pie is a study in how much uninformed diners will pay for mushy, low-grade paddlefish roe. The $65 chicken barely rises above the level of mediocrity — a bland, under-salted breast in an otherwise fine piperade, and a floppy-skinned thigh in a more concentrated pepper jus. "", ""And then there's the tasting, which Dover says about 25 percent of the guests order most nights. One of the first courses on a recent Friday was a tiny ramekin of what we (correctly) guessed to be gazpacho; the waiter's description was barely audible amid the din of the room. Is there a bit of oxidized gray around the foie gras torchon, and a bit of sinew inside? Hard to tell because the lighting's too dark at Dover post-sunset. A cozy bistro serving grilled skirt steak can keep things dim, but part of the fun at a tasting menu spot is taking in the beauty of the composed dishes in full Technicolor."", 'Grilled tuna and chickpea fries', ""There are flashes of genius during the tasting, just not enough. Rare grilled tuna, the throwaway dish of the early aughts, finds new relevance here. The interior is cool and crimson while the toro-like edges are oily and oozing with umami-rich maritime flavor. The fish sits in a pool of intense red pepper sauce and is topped with chickpea fries for dunking. Even better are ruby red shrimp from Maine, packing the distinct iodine tang you'd expect from the regal Mediterranean crevette. Dover tosses the bite-sized crustaceans into a pool of white almond soup so silky and tart that it could command 100 euros at Alain Ducasse's Le Louis XV in Monaco. "", ""Then you encounter a tomato, burrata, and strawberry salad that's little different from something your hedge fund buddy made last week at his Hamptons pool party. There's also pici pasta with butter, chanterelles, and parsley, which are coated with so many sandy breadcrumbs it's as if someone accidentally dropped the noodles on East Rockaway Beach. Lamb ribs with eggplant and mint feels less like a composed dish, more like three disparate ingredients thrown into a single bowl. If the tasting menu's individual plates sometimes taste like unfinished ideas, the $95 menu as a whole has the feel of a random collection of a la carte dishes, an iPod shuffle version of an omakase instead of the full length album it needs to be.

Then they dredge it in flour, deep fry it, and sprinkle it with dehydrated lemon powder. The flesh is (assertively) salty yet sweet. The crunch is marked. And thanks to the citrus ""dust,"" it all has a fragrant finish that recalls a gourmet version of the coating on a Haribo Gummi Peach. On the side, there\'s a bottle Tabasco-spiked honey that starts off spicy and ends with a wave of sugar. It\'s not just good, it\'s unmistakably unique. You could close your eyes, taste this dish, and know it didn\'t come from anywhere else.', ""When compared with the ranks New York's most distinctive fried chicken — the Korean-wings at Boka, the Old-Bay-spiked Bell & Evans breasts at Momofuku Noodle Bar, the classic extra tasty crispy stuff at Pies n Thighs, the surprisingly delicious boneless variety at ABC Kitchen, and the habanero-laced bliss at Ma Peche — Root & Bone's bird is no less exemplaryI'm not so amped on this chicken as Sutton is, though it's very nicely fried — to me it's too darn sweet by a mile, and I like my chicken savory — Sietsema. And the price is right too — $18 for a half-order (feeds two), and $35 for a full one."", 'Looks like McInnis and Booth have themselves a winner, which perhaps explains why the wait can reach 60 minutes or longer during peak eating. Not bad for two out-of-towners; McInnis is a Florida native who grew up in Alabama while Booth is an Australian who cooked with Jeff at Yardbird in Miami.', 'Biscuits; Fried chicken and waffles', ""Barbecue and uptown soul food notwithstanding, the diverse edibles of the South, which are so often synonymous with the notion of a larger American cuisine, have never really established as strong of a foothold in serious New York restaurants as French, Spanish, Italian, or Mexican cooking. Root & Bone, like Joaquin Baca's excellent Brooklyn Star, is an essential outlier in this regard, taking a local and seasonal approach to comfort food. And while it's far from perfect — the deviled eggs are as average as anywhere else  — Root and Bone's kick-ass classics give hope that New York can play a legit role in not just honoring the foods of the South but also in moving the culinary conversation forward."", 'Thyme-topped biscuits, whose fluffy layers seem to peel off like a magically glutinous onion, are excellent by themselves. But what makes the dish approach greatness is the accompanying bowl of honey-roasted gravy. The flavor is deep, round, and rich at first, then gives way to a restrained sweetness.', 'Indeed, there are few other savory chefs who deploy sugar with such aplomb as McInnis and Booth. They tone down the vegetal notes of mashed parsnip with a gentle maple sauce. They take a Kurobuta pork chop and inject a world of flavor into it with a heady peach-bourbon syrup. It almost veers into cloying territory until the sting of chili shocks the palate back into order, and a soft nugget or two of pork belly adds a musky uppercut.', 'That 18 oz chop is enough to feed two as a second course, or a solo diner as a one plate meal, a recommended move as many of the appetizers are entirely forgettable. Deconstructed BLTs turn out to be jaw-aching slabs of bacon with bland pimento cheese and ho-hum fried green tomatoes. Even worse are fried chicken and waffle sandwiches, two leaden gut bombs stuffed with overly-fatty thigh meat. And corn on the cob is doused in a one-note cornbread butter and stale popcorn. SELL.', 'Noise levels can reach 90 decibels or higher in the 45-seat restaurant, but give credit to the McInnis and Booth for throwing together a sexy duo of rooms, with pressed-tin ceilings (partially covered in matching silver masking tape) and a gorgeous ""open air"" dining counter that overlooks 3rd. Waiters actually exit the restaurant and serve guests from the sidewalk, a clever people-flow strategy that keeps the slim dining room from getting too crowded.', 'Meatloaf; Shrimp and grits', ""The sides are stellar, waffle cut fries with dill pickle remoulade would be a best-seller at any Major League ballgame, and the caprese salad, with tart green tomatoes and grilled peaches, approaches near classic status thanks to a few drops of malty molasses vinegar subbing in for balsamic. Meatloaf isn't really meatloaf, but rather a shredded, $24 square of short rib disguised as brownie. The red wine tang and griddle-crisped beefiness result in a product that could easily compete with the (excellent) $42 version at Tom Colicchio's Craft. And as for the shrimp and grits — this is the version to compare all other versions to. The crustaceans pack that gentle maritime tang that let you know they come from good waters; the grits are bursting with robust corn flavor; and the country ham, shellfish jus, and Brooklyn lager sauce combine to produce such a funky, salted, umami-packed punch I was convinced the chefs slipped some fermented XO sauce in there (they did not).

Carrot tartare, a hat tip to the version once served at Eleven Madison Park, is sweet and crunchy, with just enough mustard to make you wish every coleslaw could taste like this. Raw scallops seem to vibrate in the mouth with the zing and zap of yuzu, while the unexpected crunch of pistachio brings out the gentle nuttiness of the shellfish. Sometimes creativity falls flat.

He lived in Italy for a year and a half, moving from ristorante to ristorante and mastering recipes, before returning to his hometown to launch his ode to alta cucina.

In 2011 he left behind a la carte service in favor of prix fixe, which had already been the only available option on Fridays and Saturdays. Dinner then was priced at $135 per person; it is currently $155, with wine pairings available for $90 or $135.', 'Small bites', 'The tasting menu format does align with the environment. Set in a converted townhouse, the 30-seat restaurant\'s mustard walls, slatted wooden chairs, and mounted antique plates and copper pans resemble a Roman apartment where generations of a family live together.

Quivering asparagus flan barely contains a quail egg aching to ooze. Onions, caramelized for half a day into a chocolaty jam, are encircled with a crepe, baked with parmesan, and lowered into a pool of white truffle fondue. Speckled brown butter coats chubby orbs of spinach gnocchi; it came paired with almond tortellini caught in a sweet-savory tug of war between crushed amaretti cookies and glossy white truffle sauce. We were each treated to plates of a Vetri masterpiece, smoked goat with crackling skin over a slick of soothing polenta.', 'Agnolotto with pistachio soup', ""But executive chef Adam Leonti also has the chance to flex his intelligence and creativity with some newer novelties. The evening's most memorable dish was the salt-baked quail, inspired by the salt-baked branzino that Vetri helped popularize. For the quail version, Leonti blanches and purees spinach and mixes it with salt and egg white until it becomes dough-like. He wraps it around the bird, which is stuffed with spinach and farro. The result is intensely saline, which Leonti ameliorates by dousing the quail with a fragrant syrup from Alto Adige made from pine cone buds. It smells like a freshly cut lawn on a fall day."", 'Leonti is shrewd in his tinkerings with pasta. A riff on the American idea of soup/salad/pasta comes in one bowl: A silky agnolotto filled with julienned zucchini ribbons in a moss green moat fashioned solely from pistachios, onions, water, and olive oil. He draws in Spanish influences for smoked-paprika chitarra that ensnares charred octopus and Marcona almonds in its tangles. Desserts included a flamboyant blueberry baked Alaska and a pert little cake that seeped pistachio cream.', 'There were a few hiccups. A pea and ricotta tart had a dense, mealy texture. Saffron fusilli, though surrounded by a wondrous lobster emulsion tinged with absinthe, fell apart at first bite in a way that reminded me of gluten-free pasta. A server mentioned that the kitchen has been experimenting with a new batch of semolina that week, so I\'ll call it a fluke.

Further afield find a bowl of orange-date muesli splotched with yogurt and also a chia-seed pudding that manages to incorporate hemp and buckwheat."", ""There are excellent breakfast tacos— presented in authentic Austin fashion on flour tortillas—but most of Dimes' leggy and attractive patrons had their noses deep in acai bowls ($9 each). These cold soups are based on a purple berry puree shipped frozen from Brazil and reported to have medicinal properties. And they turn out to be unexpectedly tasty. All contain bananas, along with other seemingly random ingredients, among them lavender, goji berries, bee pollen, cashew cream, and coconut. In case that seems too healthy, you can also have sausage or bacon on the side for an extra couple of dollars, and wash it all down with the establishment's industrial-strength coffee."", ""Breakfast is served till 4 p.m., and there's also a lunch menu offering meal-size salads, grain concoctions, and sandwiches. Some of the lunches are remarkably transgressive, while remaining fruit and vegetable intensive. Amplified with avocado, arugula, juice-dripping roasted tomatoes, more of those sweet jalapenos, and lime-cilantro mayo, the BLT ($11) is a thing of beauty that will also burn your mouth off. And the bacon is piled on with a generous hand. (No Fakin' Bacon here.) There's an oddball banh mi made with Tuscan-style chicken livers, and a marvelous salad featuring cantaloupe, kale, and raw tomatillos – three ingredients that have probably never been in such close proximity before."", 'Acai bowls; Egg sandwich', ""But the low-key diversity of breakfast and lunch won't prepare you for the tour-de-force of dinner, when the gals get serious with their menu and its modern obsessions.

More conventionally, a splendid damp expanse of homemade burrata arrives looking like a runway model clad in heirloom tomatoes in eye-appealing colors.

And the elusive herbal qualities in hay ice cream buddied up playfully to strawberries scattered with meringue chips made from curd."", 'But many of the dishes veered from refreshing and earthy to downright austere. The kitchen goes through great pains to make a crumbly butter out of actual soil, to be swiped with seasonal vegetables. Nifty, and it certainly establishes a sense of place, but then I yearned for the next course to deliver more lushness. Instead, a bowl of shucked Quebecoise oysters arrived in a bowl of oyster leaf and sea asparagus with a faint broth of whey and dulse. It tasted like undressed weeds. And a similarly unadorned plate of cucumber with fresh currants, lemon balm, and fennel felt oddly placed between the halibut and some beautifully cooked sweetbreads with chanterelles and turnips. The wine pairings—white Rioja, rose, Pinot Grigio, Vouvray—helped add nuance to the starker preparations.', ""Cournoyer has embraced a fascinating transition as a chef.

He makes a compound butter with black truffles and Madeira, pipes it under the skin, and then tucks in a few more truffle slices. The bird is washed with extra Madeira before roasting, covered, in a snug pot over alfalfa hay for 45 minutes."", 'It arrives at the table in its rich juices, covered with generous discs of shaved, striated truffles. As decadent as the ingredients sound, the final effect is a marvel of subtleties—like taking a deep breath in the countryside, with wafts of earth and herb that drift by rather than assailing. The buttery meat more than compensates for the lack of crisp skin, and the yielding textures are cleverly mirrored by an accompanying salad of Bibb lettuces glossed in schmaltz vinaigrette.', '', 'The chicken cost $100; I didn\'t feel one speck of buyer\'s remorse when the bill arrived. It was the supplemental centerpiece to an already remarkable eight-course meal. Edulis (""edible"" in Latin) has the air of a dinner party.

Caballo mans the kitchen; Nemeth oversees service and occasionally jumps on the line as well.', ""They both left jobs in Toronto to travel and work abroad in Spain and Italy (among other places) for several years before returning home. The food has the savor of someone who absorbed Europe's modern culinary culture at a leisured pace rather than in a fevered expedition. The ever-changing dishes Caballo sends out in five- or seven-course menus aren't exactly homey, but they taste the way I'd imagined Caballo would cook if he were trying to impress guests at his own dining table.

Nova Scotia lobster with Australian black winter truffles (a hint of what would come with the chicken) came suspended in an astringent, palate-perking gelee of young, foraged grapes. The flavors warmed with the next two dishes: house-smoked eel with chanterelles and cauliflower in matelote sauce (which includes red wine, fish stock, and crème fraiche) and octopus grilled over charcoal over a rich corn emulsion with radishes and basil sprouts. Smoked duck breast with hunks of feisty duck sausage and morsels stuffed silky foie gras primed the taste buds for the forthcoming chicken.

335,"[""\n  What's the meatiest restaurant in the city? You might be inclined to mention some steakhouse like Peter Luger, but what with the tomato appetizer, pretzel rolls, fried potatoes, creamed spinach, and farewell piece of cheesecake, only 50 percent or less of your meal is actually meat. Pondering this while joy riding on Queens' wild eastern frontier one day recently, some friends and I stumbled on a far meatier place: Bundu Khan.\n  "", 'There it sat all aglow on Union Turnpike as the sun set, a narrow storefront in bright green and orange wedged between a cleaners and a laundromat, directly across the street from an ancient German butcher called Hans Meat-O-Rama, which we took to be a good omen. The interior boasts two rows of plain dark tables, each with its own number designation hoisted on a pole. The walls are the same bilious green as the façade, with color blow-ups of kebabs as the main decoration. At the rear, a woman in a sari staffs an order counter equipped with a computer connection to the kitchen behind her. Order at the counter and your dishes are delivered to your numbered table. Not sure how to tip with a system like this, but 20 percent always works.', 'A rough calculation reveals that, out of the menu\'s 75 or so choices, over 85 percent involve meat, including lamb, goat, beef, and chicken. The rest are breads, vegetable curries (only three of those), a single fish dish, and plain white rice. Yes, there are extreme-meat selections. One goes by the intriguing name of kat-a-kat ($21), though it contains no discernible cat. When it arrives, you get to play a little game called ""Name That Organ."" Topped with shredded raw ginger and a lemon wedge (which you should squeeze on immediately), the bumpy brown morass certainly contains goat or lamb kidney, brain, heart, and testicles, which are, respectively, tart, squishy, muscular, and spongy. The surface of the kidney tidbits is shiny and nephritic. If you love offal, this dish is a joy; if you don\'t, maybe not so much—though the flavor is mellower and less skanky than you might expect.', ""Then there's badshahi haleem ($10), sometimes considered the national dish of Pakistan. It goes back to the Mughal Empire that once dominated this part of South Asia, when the food and the folkways of the region were heavily influenced by the Middle East. Named after a mosque in Lahore, once the largest in the world, this type of haleem consists of ground beef stewed with wheat and lentils for eight or more hours, resulting in a consistency like library paste—but what delicious paste it is, dotted with green chiles and caramelized onions! The thickness makes it perfect for scooping up with the restaurant's whole-wheat, tandoori-cooked rotis; white-flour, yeast-risen naans (both breads $1 apiece); or, best of all, the deep-fried, multilayered lachcha paratha ($3.50), which is one of Bundu Khan's specialties. The flaky flatbread almost falls apart and leaves your hands slippery with grease—but if you can maneuver it well enough to grab a fistful of haleem, the taste combination is fantastic."", 'This being a self-described kebab house, there are kebabs you\'ve probably never heard of. Tenderest is gola kebab ($10), associated in a menu side note with Karachi, Pakistan\'s Burns Road, named after Dr. James Burns, an early 19th century British colonial physician. Gola means ""hand grenade,"" which this kebab resembles in shape, if not texture. In fact, finely minced with papaya, yogurt, and spices, the beef is so soft it must be laced together with thread like a girdle. The first thing you should do upon receiving it is carefully remove the thread, which can be quite annoying. Though the gola kebab won\'t look like a grenade anymore after being unthreaded, it will still explode in your mouth with flavor.', 'My table liked nearly every kebab we tried, with the exception of the boti kebab. These lamb chunks marinated in yogurt and then grilled melt into mush in your mouth, proving that, where meat is concerned there can be such a thing as too tender. In chocolate such melting could be an advantage, but with lamb cubes you want something more sinewy.', 'Bundu Khan serves virtually nothing but meat—boiled, broiled, fried, or tandoori-roasted—and the South Asian immigrants who come here, the women dressed in sumptuous and colorful outfits, the men in plain sports clothes, are willing to wait outside for it and think nothing of foregoing vegetables entirely for one meal, at least. Chicken is a highlight, too. You can get it sauced in a Delhi-style qorma of medium spiciness; in a glorious, particolored biryani; ground-up in seekh, chapli, or reshmi kebabs; or in boneless or bone-in chicken tikka (order the bone-in for extra flavor). Best of all is chargha ($15) an entire bird laved in lemon juice and what the menu is pleased to call ""Oriental spices."" The sheer size of the chicken suggests you may be eating the leftovers for days to come.', ""Could a vegetarian get by at Bundu Khan? Barely. The tastiest vegetarian curry is chana masala ($7), perfectly cooked chickpeas immersed in dark gravy. Sometimes there's also palak paneer, the familiar casserole of spinach and fresh pressed cheese. But really, the restaurant is set up to encourage orgies of meat consumption, and that is exactly what you should expect. And you'll find yourself eating more meat than you ever expected too, even at a place like Peter Luger.""]"

There, the food can be even spicier than that of Isaan.', 'One of the first restaurants in New York to concentrate on southern Thai food is Kitchen 79, a new spot in Jackson Heights in the shadow of the 7 train, in a space that once held Arunee Thai.

The stew is also vegetable heavy, bobbing with pumpkins, bamboo shoots, and string beans. What are those striped globes that look like miniature watermelons? Thai eggplants. This strange and salty curry demands to be consumed with plenty of rice. One bite and you'll wrinkle up your nose; by the second you may or may not love it."", 'Similarly spicy, but not so fishy, is kua kling, a dish that undermines our ideas of what constitutes a curry. The recipe is typical of the unusual dry curries of southern Thailand. Instead of being mixed with sweet coconut milk, the ground pork (or beef or chicken) is cooked in a curry paste with a small amount of water, along with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, until the meat turns damp but not soupy. The accompanying cucumbers and lettuce are used to scoop up bites, serving to partly staunch the burn. Though kua kling outwardly resembles an Isaan larb, the dish is much more variegated in its flavoring.', 'But not all the curries from this region are spicy. Showing the influence of Indian food on southern Thai, gaeng massaman (the second word is a corruption of ""Muslim"") is a mild curry of beef, potatoes, and peanuts principally flavored with onions and coconut milk. Mellowed with turmeric, yellow curry (gaing karee, $10 to $13 depending on principal ingredient) is also tender to the tongue, and unspeakably rich. Malaysian and Indonesian fare also inform the food of the southern region. Maybe you\'ll be surprised to hear there\'s a version of Malaysian roti canai called roti panang nuea ($7) featuring the same flaky pancake. But instead of the soupy chicken curry that usually comes alongside, there\'s a more substantial serving of a coconut-thickened beef stew that will remind you of Indonesian rendang.', 'Fried shrimp cakes', ""Other apps are similarly lively. You've never eaten bigger or better curry puffs ($4) – three hefty crescents of puff pastry stuffed with poultry that may owe something to the early Dutch colonial presence in the region; then again they may be Spanish or even British in origin – they look like Cornish pasties. Part of the lure of Southeast Asian food is its wild mixture of influences, aboriginal, colonial, and modern international. Other delectable southern Siamese snacks include deep-fried shrimp cakes and chicken wings lacquered with turmeric and fish sauce."", ""What about the Isaan cook laboring side-by-side with the southern cook in the kitchen? He rocks the green peppercorns – which look like little trees – in several notable recipes, including a stew of wild boar called pad ped moo pha ($13), which might be one of New York's hottest dishes. It left one of my guests hiccupping after a few bites. Another northern dish worth ordering is ka prow ka moo, a thick slurry of pork knuckle, fiery fresh chiles, and basil in a thick sweet soy sauce. It's so rich with pork fat that even after blotting your lips afterwards you'll still feel like they've been injected with Botox."", ""Kitchen 79 has unusual décor.

But last year, a dispute between the restaurant\'s proprietors and the building\'s owner dismantled the business.

Follow his progress in this travelogue/review series, The Road to the 38, and check back at the end of the year to find out which restaurants made the cut.\n  "", ""It's heartening to find the flavors of Turkey and the Middle East emerging in ambitious, finer dining restaurants across America. The nutty luster of tahini, the wafts of cinnamon and earthy za'atar, vegetable salads lolling in olive oil, spiced lamb in every permutation: Their prominence in our national culinary identity is overdue."", 'Ana Sortun was an early ambassador for these cuisines. She studied at the famed La Varenne cooking school in France and then moved to Massachusetts, working for a Tunisian-born chef, Moncef Meddab, then running the kitchen at Casablanca restaurant in Harvard Square. In 1997, Sortun travelled to Turkey where she encountered pomegranate molasses, spice blends as brain-teasing as jigsaw puzzles, and airy pita pulled fresh from the oven. Four years later, she opened Oleana in Cambridge, celebrating these sun-dazed flavors and demonstrating how nimbly American ideas can meld with the ingredients of the ""Mediterranean"" (a Middle Eastern restaurant euphemism ripe for retirement).', ""Is Oleana still relevant 13 years later, in the age of Yotam Ottolenghi's cookbooks and fusion fattoush? I visited both Sortun's flagship as well as Sarma, the new small plates restaurant in Somerville (a couple miles northwest of Boston) where Sortun is a co-owner."", 'Labneh-filled burrata; Cacik', 'Our warm-spirited server nearly lost my attention when she began to describe burrata as a special. Let\'s formally designate the milky-buttery mozzarella as the molten chocolate cake of the 2010s. But then she went on: ""The kitchen hollows it out and fills it with labneh flavored with za\'atar and serves it with grilled pita spread with chopped morels and green garlic."" Hmm. Stuffing burrata with yogurt strained to the thickness of cream cheese did sound tempting …', ""It was, in fact, a dairy rendezvous—a meeting at the intersection of smooth and delicate. The yogurt gave the cheese shell a tangy new angle. The lemony za'atar merged with the mushrooms and garlic on the pita, intensifying each bite in the same way that herbes de Provence adds fragrant depth to ratatouille."", ""The lesson: If the choices at Oleana seem overwhelming, just look for yogurt and all will be right. Cacik, a classic Turkish dip, blends labneh with spinach, mint, cucumber, and garlic. It comes in a circle, dotted with spiced chickpeas and indented in the center to hold a pool of olive oil. Orbs of spinach falafel sprawl over a magenta bed of yogurt and beet puree, so soothing against the fried garbanzo's crunch."", '', ' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuinoa salad with carrot-saffron soup', 'Yes, Oleana remains very much germane. Sortun and chef de cuisine Cara Chigazola have mastered a tricky symmetry: Their food, even when occasionally pulling from current American trends, tastes true to the lands of their inspiration. The plating is modern and pretty without detracting from the crucial interplay of flavors.', ""Take the chickpea terrine, an igloo-shaped mold of hummus, firmed up with pureed potato, and filled with braised greens, golden raisins, pistachios, and dried apricots. Tahini sauce is spread across the top like freeform frosting, flecks of Aleppo pepper look like bacon bits but taste tart and hot, and a shallow well at its crown contains a tablespoon of pomegranate molasses. All the elements flirt with one another. In another special, a pebbly beach of quinoa salad with date puree disappears under a tide of carrot-saffron soup poured tableside. The soup's complex sweetness offsets crisp crab croquettes floating in the center of the bowl. Ouzo aioli acts as a rich-toned backup singer to a duet of grilled broccoli and firm sfela cheese crusted with walnuts and sesame seeds."", '', ' \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShawarma', ""Sortun's husband, Chris Kurth, grows the produce for the restaurant at the couple's farm: The quality shines through in dishes like a reinterpreted shawarma, with lush shreds of lamb snug in crackly phyllo with pickled turnip greens, bright and pleasantly bitter. And don't leave the cozy dining room without having dessert. Longtime pastry chef Maura Kilpatrick opened nearby Sofra Bakery with Sortun in 2008. Kilpatrick sees Oleana's thematic through-line to dreamy conclusion with creations like Turkish profiteroles filled with brown-butter cream, slicked with sesame caramel, and finished with crumbled halva and cashews."", ""On the side I ordered what became the meal's only off-note: A gritty, muddy cup of Turkish coffee. I much preferred sipping on a sour cherry spritzer of sorts that came with bohsalino, a rectangle of pistachio paste scattered with fresh cherries. In the sour cherry drink bobbed a popsicle made with mastic, the edible resin popular in Turkey that hints of pine."", ""Squid saganaki; Labneh with za'atar"", ""Sortun's latest project is a partnership with Cassie Piuma, Oleana's former chef de cuisine whose previous gigs include a stint at Providence's Al Forno. It opened this past September, and in a reflection of the times it's a more casual restaurant, modeled after Turkish tavernas known as meyhanes. Fittingly, a large bar with neon-green stools takes up nearly half the space. Ornate plates purchased in Istanbul line one turquoise wall, setting the scene stylishly against the dominant motif of exposed brick. The setting at bistro-like Oleana calms; the scene at Sarma rouses."", ""Likewise, Sarma pushes boundaries more playfully. The kitchen focuses even more squarely on small plates, broken up into categories like meze, shish (foods cooked on brochettes), savory pancakes and pies, and the namesake sarmas, or rolled and stuffed dishes. Young, engaged servers encourage diners to kick off the meal with riffs on bar snacks—perhaps dates stuffed with goat cheese and fried in sheer batter, or sesame-coated haloumi fries with white fig ketchup, the next generation's mozzarella sticks with marinara. Balls of labneh coated with za'atar harken to yesteryear's chevre balls rolled in herbs. Here, too, there are many dairy-sluiced seductions."", ""And after we've ordered squid saganaki (a stew heady with olives and ouzo), straightforward lamb souvlakia (threaded on a skewer and grilled), and a version of fattoush with strawberries and arugula that strayed a little too far from the original for my liking, another server approached the table. He was circulating specials from a tray, dim sum-style. First up: hunks of boneless fried chicken, with sesame, nigella seeds, and green chile enlivening the rippling crust. Fried chicken is the universal language of food. Sure, why not?"", ""The staff parceled out the dishes evenly and thoughtfully: A meat dish would arrive with a seafood or vegetable counterpart. Aromatic cocktails, local brews, and glasses of appropriate wines like Greek Xinomavro went down easily. Ultimately, I preferred the more finessed cooking at Oleana, but both restaurants have obvious value. For residents well acquainted with Sortun's culinary dimensions, Sarma is a plucky, fresh vantage on those balmy flavors. For visitors or those new to Middle Eastern cuisines, Oleana stands strong as a local—and national—treasure."", 'Email Bill at bill@eater.com and follow him at @BillAddison.']"
339,"['The youthfully gray-haired John Winterman, a self-proclaimed ""maitre diva"" who once plied his jacket and tie trade at Daniel, Charlie Trotter\'s, and other white linen factories, strolls over to an older gentleman at Batard in Tribeca and hands him a can of Pabst Blue Ribbon in a koozie. ""That\'s what you get when you\'ve arrived,"" Winterman later quips. It was like watching Manhattan tipping its hat back to Brooklyn, even as Brooklyn increasingly takes its inspiration from Manhattan.', ""And just as the stereotypically hipster beer isn't what one might expect at a prix fixe-only spot, neither is an off-the-menu fried chicken. The name of the dish is technically schnitzel — pounded, breaded, and fried meat — though half of the preparation is nearly the opposite: a rich and crispy poussin drumstick."", ""The other half of the schnitzel, the young bird's flattened breast, keeps things more conservative. The milk-fed meat recalls the soft texture of sweetbreads; the exterior boasts an audible crunch; and the flavor is pure butter and olive oil. Add a smear of ligonberries for sweetness, a dab of sea buckthorn puree for a bit of sourness, and wash it all down with a $25 glass of Marie Weiss Champagne."", 'Such is the high-low state of affairs at Batard, which replaces the avant-garde Corton that closed last year. The wonderful double-entendre of a name either refers to a fancy vineyard in Burgundy or the unwanted product of extra-marital monkey business. No more 16-course tastings like at Corton, just set menus at $55, $65, and $75 for two, three, or four courses.', 'Poussin schnitzel', ""Winterman, who will try to sell you cheeses smuggled in from abroad at multiple points throughout the evening, is a partner in the venture, as is Austrian-born chef Markus Glocker, a Gordon Ramsay vet. And the ringleader of course is the King of Tribeca himself, Drew Nieporent, who started running this space in 1985 as Montrachet, back when today's crop of hot young chef's were still watching Muppet Babies."", 'Montrachet\'s importance can\'t be overstated: It helped establish Tribeca as a legitimate outpost for fine dining in the same way that Wylie Dufresne\'s wd-50 introduced many of us to tasting menus on the Lower East Side. The original chef was David Bouley and the goal was to serve high-end French fare in a slightly more relaxed environment (and at lower prices) than the old-school ""Le\'s"" and ""La\'s"" Nieporent used to work at. ""Affordable French restaurants are as rare as air-conditioned subway cars,"" Bryan Miller wrote in his three-star New York Times review of Montrachet, and he praised the $16 prix fixe as ""one of the better deals in town."" Montrachet also offered a $26 set menu, which works out to $57 in inflation adjusted dollars, just $8 off from Batard\'s current three-courser.', ""Batard isn't as groundbreaking or exciting as either of its predecessors. But it still ranks as one of the year's most enjoyable and approachable new restaurants, turning out playful riffs on modern European-American fare."", '', 'Octopus ""pastrami""', 'Glocker uses the natural gelatins of octopus and the warming spices of pastrami to make a silky mollusk terrine; it looks like a visual ode to a cobblestone road and it wouldn\'t be out of place between two slices of good rye. He employs the gentle sugars of scallops to mimic the sweetness of the corn soup that surrounds them. And he deconstructs a Linzer torte into a killer salad of roasted beets, red currants, creme fraiche and ""cookie"" breadcrumbs. It\'s a brilliant dish where the line between sweet and savory is so brilliantly blurred the salad could easily function as a dessert with just a hint more fruit.', ""Sometimes the creativity goes overboard. Poached oysters with pickles are fine starters on their own, though it's not clear why each shell is garnished with a knob of fried pigtail. Pork and shellfish is a classic combination (chowder!) but the addition of the crispy swine complicates what could have been a one-bite affair. And while rabbit with flavors of bouillabaisse results in an excellent saffron-heavy soup, substituting the dish's traditionally rich fish for one-note hare is questionable."", ""Pro Tip: Ask for a table closer to the bar for a more tolerable noise level. The sound-absorbing carpets and tablecloths of Corton are gone, and even with a bit of soundproofing newly installed, Batard's decibel levels can still strain the ears."", ""But such an inconvenience doesn't mean Nieporent has fully embraced the stripped-down ethos of our budget gourmet era. Riedel wine stems are thin and tall; good Laguiole and Christofle knives inspire thoughts of flatware robbery. And instead of amuses, the kitchen sends out bread — hot, delicious poppy seed baguettes that you'll use to mop up the remnants of black olive tortellini with foamy basil mousse sauce."", 'Veal tenderloin', ""Meats rule the entree section, though keep in mind that Glocker is going for European-style balance with classic sauces, rather than nouveau-American purity, where the chef is a slave to the protein's natural inclinations. So veal isn't a chop but rather a tramezzini; the gorgeously pink loin wrapped in dough and paired with a vinegar-heavy jus. Lamb for two doesn't exhibit Breslin-style gaminess; it's rather an exercise in mild flavors."", 'Strip steak boasts no concentrated dry-aged funk because it isn\'t dry-aged. The beef is dipped in soy, ""triple-seared"" over binchotan charcoal, plated with beef tongue and braised beef cheek, and finished with a lip smacking, Madeira red wine sauce.', 'Cheese cart; Milk bread', 'Consider one of Winterman\'s rare cheeses for dessert, though it would be a shame to miss out on the proper sweets, like caramelized milk bread with brown butter ice cream, or a soft ""cheesecake"" of fromage blanc with cilantro and lemon verbena.

He doesn't, though he's selling an open-face roast beef sandwich as a starter too. His pitch sounded like an antidote to our long tasting menu world where you don't get any bread until course fifteen or red meat until course twenty. And so his pitch was well-received."", '', ""This is all par for course at The Breslin in the Ace Hotel, a half-decade-old gastropub whose porky pyrotechnics make it all the more relevant in our vegetable-heavy era. Such protein-heavy hospitality is precisely what one might expect from April Bloomfield, a bi-costal chef with a track record of casually posing with pig corpses. And neither she nor her business partner, Ken Friedman, are down with modern cuisine's whole time-release gratification thing."", ""Like sex on a first date, eating a lamb chop as an appetizer is awkward at first, but once the flesh is in front of you it's hard to say no."", ""Just keep that all in mind before you deign to devour an entire lamb chop as an appetizer, which can feel a bit like sex on a first date; it's awkward at first but once the flesh is in front of you it's hard to say no. And Bloomfield isn't sending out those little lollipop chops you stole off the hors d'oeuvre platter at your uncle's wedding. This lamb is a proper chop, pounded like veal Milanese and painted green with spicy cilantro chutney. Don't expect medium-rare mush in your mouth, this flattened affair is a study in the occasional deliciousness of eating something medium-well. The chop has big-steak heft, big-game flavor, and a world of fragrant heat from the verdant chutney."", 'Lamb chop; roast beef', 'Now that your palate is primed you can move onto that rare roast beef — the original American answer to carpaccio. The kitchen gently warms the crimson slices and drapes them over fat-fried onion bread. The beef tastes of blood, and horseradish cream is your ultra-rich mayo substitute.', ""Step three: Order the saltimbocca. A sheet of nutty prosciutto covers a layer of sage-infused pork so thin I'm certain Bloomfield could market this nationwide as carnivorous fruit-roll-up. And what a school snack this would be; the savory juices squirt out as you masticate, like MSG-laced chewing tobacco."", ""None of this food looks new but it all tastes new and that's the genius of Bloomfield and her resident chef, Christina Lecki, who prove that British-accented pub fare, however rustic, can feel just as refined and boundary pushing as the American avant-garde. Sure, there are other great meateries in New York, and if you combined DBGB, Bar Boulud, and restaurant Daniel into a fearsome Lyonnaise Voltron you might have the greatest. But that unlikely scenario notwithstanding, it's worth noting that The Breslin, five years after opening, has grown into the best place to eat meat in The Big Apple, period."", ""The bill of fare reads like a dead dog's breakfast in the high-class canine afterlife. At any given time The Breslin sells up to five terrines, four sausages, two meat pies, two to three types of lamb, pork fat-fried peanuts, pork rinds, pork shoulder, a whole suckling pig dinner that starts at $680 before tax and tip, and a prime rib feast that starts at $760."", 'My suggestion: do the curried lamb supper, which feeds eight for $640. The entry fee guarantees access to those killer chops, flaky samosas, saag aloo, and a cannonball-sized Kashmiri leg of lamb that you wrap up in buckwheat parathas and eat like a taco. The large-format affair is like a tasting menu served all at once, the culinary equivalent of binge watching ""House of Cards."" Your ideal pairing: a chilled glass of gamay for $11.', '', 'Seafood sausage', ""There are a few fish items on the menu too, and the best one of course is a sausage. The butter-drenched seafood brat is a crack blend of shrimp, scallops and lobster. Testament to Lecki's cooking is how each component sings through with remarkable clarity; it's how you wished frutti di mare would taste at Italian restaurant but never does. Lecki also makes a mean merguez sausage, topped with lemon breadcrumbs to counter the smoky harissa. She sends out a mild blood sausage, which practically crumbles itself into a runny egg. And she forges a forearm-sized pig's foot sausage, scented with nutmeg, fried and paired with spicy pickled vegetables. That $49 trotter for two is less about musky flavor of pork and a more about sticky, gelatinous, stomach warming bliss; leftovers will last for days."", ""Keep in mind that The Breslin's reservations policy* is pretty much identical to sister spot The Spotted Pig: It doesn't take them for the most part. And nor should it. Friedman and Bloomfield cater to hungry diners rather than plan-ahead people who insist on booking casual steak dinners 30-days out (and then cancel them). So don't be the plan-ahead person. Just swing by The Breslin in off-hours. I usually head over around 10:30 p.m. or later and grab a bar seat right away."", 'The lamb burger; Scallions with Romesco sauce', ""Is the grass-fed lamb burger sitting in front of every third patron? That's because it's just as compelling as it was when it debuted back in 2009; a side of cumin mayo lets you double down on the locker-room odor and the medium-rare meat is so soft it's almost as if you're eating a hot terrine on a bun. It's not as easygoing as an everyday beef burger and that's why The Breslin surely ranks with Ma Peche as New York's most envelope-pushing hotel restaurant; such establishments usually cater to a more conservative crowd."", ""Instead of chicken fingers The Breslin gives us scrumpets, fried batons of fatty lamb meant for dipping in mint vinegar. Instead of gussied-up pot pies for $36 we get stinky beef stilton pies for $9. And instead of a typical Caesar salad Bloomfield gives us an essay in fish oil, packing her croutons with more anchovy flavor than a jar full of anchovies. The lesson is this: Great chefs don't always ask diners what they want, they tell diners what they want, and if you disagree with that you can go to the local IHOP and build your own stack of pancakes."", ""For a number of years, my barometer for the official start of winter was whenever Bloomfield decided to put her bone marrow soup on the menu. Now that it's summer, The Breslin is doing a thin corn and squash soup. Skip it, and take a pass on the hen of the woods mushrooms with prosciutto too. Remember, you're here to eat meat, like a summery stew of swine. Lecki uses milk as her weapon, braising the pig down to the texture of pillows, and coaxing a riot of sage into a soft, herbal sweetness. Time for bed."", ""Or perhaps it's time for steak. The Breslin's ribeye for two, cooked in its own fat in a steel pan, has a dry-aged funk that's detectable before it hits the table and that lingers on your fingers for hours after. The meat doesn't quite have the same level of concentrated minerality that I fell in love with at Roberta's, but it's still a class-A cut. It boasts a level of fattiness that mandates a tannic California syrah ($16) as much as it does a Widow Jane Manhattan. Or perhaps more importantly, such bovine brilliance is yet another reminder to all the hedge funders and tourists tossing their money under the broilers at Del Frisco's, Wolfgang's, or STK that our city's best steaks are not to be found in steakhouses, but rather at restaurants with actual chefs."", '', 'Ants on a Log. Peanut butter mousse, celery sorbet, raisin, pretzel', ""At this point you'd hope that desserts were terrible because you've already stuffed yourself beyond reason. Sadly, they're as excellent as they were back in 2009. Strawberry sorbet is so fragrant it could be sold in the perfume section of Macy's; throw a few spoonfuls of that into your Eton Mess (more strawberries, cream and crunchy meringue) and there's your summer evening in the British countryside."", ""A few nights back I passed by the chef's table at the tail-end of someone else's hog dinner. A pig carcass sat in the center, stripped to its bones like a garbage pail skeleton in a Heathcliff cartoon. It was a very particular type of haute-junkyard carnage that made me wonder whether the Breslin could do away with custodial staff and let in a herd of stray cats at night to do the cleaning. Perhaps not, but such are the meaty fantasies engendered by one of New York's great restaurants."", ""*Update: The Breslin now takes a limited number of reservations on OpenTable, following in the footsteps of Bloomfield's Tosca Cafe and The John Dory."", 'Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.']"

Hearty Germans arrived at the small colony in the 1820s. But at the dawn of the twentieth century, when Detroit became an industrial capital brimming with factories and Henry Ford opened his automobile company, immigrants began arriving from all over the world seeking work. Their deep-rooted communities still support the restaurants that make up the fabric of Detroit\'s enduring dining scene. Among several paragons, there was only one highly trafficked but noteworthy disappointment.', 'Top: American Coney Island; Bottom: Lafayette Coney Island', 'Any odyssey into Detroit\'s food culture begins with a coney—a chili dog cradled in a steamed bun with chopped onion and a couple slashings of yellow mustard. Origins of the ""coney"" moniker are hazy, though likely it came to Michigan in the early 1900s from Greek immigrants who passed through Ellis Island and heard of, or perhaps sampled, a Coney Island hot dog. Less murky is the man who popularized the dish: Constantine ""Gust"" Keros, who came to America in 1903 and, after peddling hot dogs from a cart, opened American Coney Island in 1917. Eventually Gust\'s brother, William, joined the business and then opened Lafayette Coney Island right next door.', 'Lafayette is no longer family-owned, though the grandchildren of Gust Keros still run American, which is clearly the more ambitious business between the two. American is as shiny as a new baseball stadium, with checkered floors and bright red and gold stripes running down the toothpaste-white walls. It runs a successful outpost in Las Vegas. Lafayette, in stark contrast, looks like a 1950s lunch counter, with avocado-colored paneling and beige tile. Service can be gruff. Both places inspire fierce loyalties.', ""Which is better? It's easy to decide for yourself: Coneys at both Lafayette and American cost $2.35 and, unless it's the prime lunch hour, you can be done eating in less than half an hour. (Bring a pack of Tums for dessert.) I found them similar but slightly preferred the one at Lafayette: The toppings showed a more generous hand, and the balance between sweet and sharp flavors was slightly more attuned. American's hot dog flaunted more snap, however. A preference between the two, then, can easily come down to environment: American's incessant cheer or Lafayette's Edward Hopper moodiness?

The Lebanese family that runs Al-Ameer also operates a butcher shop next door, so this is a place to indulge in meat dishes like sujuk sausage, lively with paprika and cumin, or raw kibbeh, minced beef massaged with bulgur wheat, pureed onion, and subtle spices. Squeamish souls can opt for fried kibbeh, ground lamb croquettes studded with pine nuts that are falafel's meaty counterpart."", 'Both falafel and fried kibbeh arrive as part of the Al-Ameer maza, a spread of small plates that comes either as a serving for two for $26.95 or four for $49.99.

Servers brought the dishes in waves: hummus and baba ghanoush, labneh (drained yogurt) sprinkled with dill and dotted with olives, puckery stuffed grape leaves, palate-cleansing tabbouleh heavy on the parsley, and jawaneh, the garlicky, lemony Lebanese version of chicken wings.', 'Our table was already chockablock when the server delivered a platter of stuffed lamb. The name turned out to be a misnomer. The lamb was roasted on its own, hacked into lush shreds, and then piled onto a plate with traditional ingredients for stuffing: rice seasoned with lemony sumac and handfuls of slivered almonds. It was a deconstruction of sorts that nonetheless came together beautifully. 12710 West Warren Avenue, Dearborn, 313-582-8185, website.', 'El Barzon patio', ""Just off Michigan Avenue, the broad artery through Southwest Detroit, sits this local haunt that serves Italian and Mexican food. Yes, both cuisines, though they aren't entwined: Don't expect saltimbocca napped in tomatillo salsa or enchiladas layered with Bolognese and mozzarella. Owner Norberto Garita, a native of Puebla, Mexico, cooked at a now-defunct Italian restaurant for nearly a decade before opening El Barzon in 2006. He planned to cook his native foods but also didn't want to let his acquired expertise languish, either. The menu, then, lists Italian and Mexican dishes separately, never dipping into fusion experiments."", ""But the kitchen's duality does make for a charmingly brain-jangling meal. It's like ordering dinner from two favorite neighborhood restaurants simultaneously. Neither halves of the menu delve into regional obscurities: Most dishes are so familiar they're essentially American. We strived to be equal opportunity in our ordering: arugula salad with Parmesan and chile relleno, veal piccata and chicken enchiladas, a trio of pastas and two versions of tamales. And to drink? First a margarita, then a glass of Chianti."", ""One cuisine didn't outshine the other, either. The piccata seduced with its kiss of capers and white wine. Enchiladas didn't rely on a mantle of cheese; its sauce of jalapeño, tomatillo, and roasted poblano pepper bore a feisty bite. The pasta trio (cheese ravioli bathed in tomato, cavatelli smothered in mushrooms and cream, strozzapretti with sausage) and a chile relleno in salsa rojo each dispatched their own versions of red-sauce comfort. You can guess the choices for dessert: tres leches or tiramisu? (Go for the latter.)"", ""In winter customers huddle together in the dining room painted sage and with sombreros on the wall.

Follow his progress in this travelogue/review series, The Road to the 38, and check back at the end of the year to find out which restaurants made the cut.\n  "", 'Chef-owner Tony Maws received his share of accolades at his first restaurant, Craigie Street Bistrot, located in a cramped basement space in Cambridge about a half-mile from Harvard University. But in 2010, when he moved his business into the light of a standalone brick building closer to MIT, he ascended to the national map and stayed put. Craigie on Main maintains the kind of ambassador status afforded to one or two places in most every U.S. city—the ambitious, elevated American restaurant led by a perfectionist who keeps pace with trends but never loses sight of his own culinary compass.', 'The digs certainly fit the part. The room is so comforting it is almost patriotic: brick walls, partly painted and partly exposed; polished wood floors that make the starched white tablecloths stand out in high relief; a wraparound burgundy banquette in one corner. Much of the kitchen is open and in line of sight from the moment you enter. The cooks tango around one another frantically, but their stovetops gleam. They have nothing to hide.', ""My recent dinner at Craigie showed off Maws' penchant for technical precision. A curling octopus tentacle was seared to smokiness, offset by chickpeas that dissolved to puree on the tongue and a black garlic vinaigrette that pumped out umami. Two scallions, twisted into a complex bow on top, received their own attractive scorching to echo the octopus. The mirror effect in a bowl of squid ink rigatoni was even more arresting: The black pasta was cut to match the shape of squid ringlets, and they had such a similar al dente texture that I had to concentrate on the flavor to distinguish them. Fried clams were too heavily battered for my taste, though I admired how the other, powerful elements of the dish—preserved lemon, pickled peppers, an anchoïade (similar to tapenade) as black as tar—breached the crust to zing the clams."", 'Squid ink rigatoni; Octopus à la plancha', ""Maws is known for his meaty predilections (one menu signature is confit and roasted pig's head for two), but the kitchen revealed a delicate hand with seafood. Blushing sea trout simmered in olive oil just to flakiness, and, in a nod to Middle Eastern cuisines currently in favor, it was drizzled with tahini vinaigrette. A Levantine gust also blew through a fragrant, soothing saffron-vanilla pudding dotted with apricot sorbet."", ""It wasn't until the meal's end that I realized how low on the food chain I'd ordered. At the kitchen's pass, the cooks were assembling the restaurant's lauded burger — a half-pound brute adorned with cheddar and homemade ketchup pinged with mace. I should have marched into the bar, where the burger is served (except on Sundays, when it anchors the dining room's brunch menu), and started dinner all over again."", 'Beef heart pastrami crostini', ""There was no shortage of meat during lunch at Coppa, the Italian-themed wine bar and small plates haunt in Boston's leafy South End. A steel-gray pig sign above the door swung in the breeze. On the table, in the flesh, was the namesake dish—pink and white kerchiefs arranged in a circle around a plate, as veined as radicchio leaves but silky in only the way that properly aged, salt-cured pork shoulder can be. Alongside stood a plate of toast piled with shaved beef heart pastrami, brawny in flavor yet feathery in texture. A slick of harissa under the toast held its own with a jolt of peppery acidity."", ""Chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette opened Coppa in 2009 as a little sister to Oringer's Spanish tapas bombshell, Toro; the duo have lately been giving their attention to Toro's Manhattan spinoff that opened last year. Coppa has its own ardent devotees, and when eating the most carnivorous dishes I understood why. Bone marrow made a sly substitute for cheese on white pizza, its fatty gush surprisingly soothing among cured beef heart and horseradish shavings that resembled grated parmesan. And there was a lilting rendition of cacio e pepe, ricotta gnocchi with perocino and pepper but with the addition of nasturtium butter that gave the dish an herbaceous lift."", 'Gnocchi with nasturtium', ""But a few dishes fell flat. One antipasto combined stracciatella with apricots, toast, greens, and a generous trail of caviar into a summery tableau. The ingredients had nothing in common, though, and didn't socialize well as flavors. Metallic-tasting blobs of uni tasted one day past their prime in an otherwise satisfying dish of twisty gemelli tossed among clams, bits of pancetta, and lovage. And I love charred food as much as the next obsessive grazer, but a head of cauliflower looked like it had needed a fire extinguisher. Maybe Oringer and Bissonnette's middle child could use a little extra TLC just now?"", ""For 50 years the space under Harvard Square's tenacious art house cinema, Brattle Theatre, lodged a bar called Casablanca. In 1996 the owner hired Ana Sortun to help expand the place into a full-fledged restaurant, serving chicken tagine and other dishes with spices that alluded to Morocco. For decades Casablanca was an institution, a convenient, easygoing post-movie hangout: As a college student, I had one of my first legal cocktails there after seeing Schindler's List."", ""Casablanca finally closed in December 2012, and in its place a year later local chef Michael Scelfo opened his first solo venture, named after the architectural firm that designed the building in the late 1800s. Alden & Harlow is more than a simple reincarnation of a beloved neighborhood watering hole: Scelfo has turned it into one of the Boston area's buzziest new restaurants."", 'Squid ink rigatoni; Octopus à la plancha', 'People jam this place nightly, and blessedly the restaurant does take reservations. The crowd is predictably young, and savvy enough to come in groups to share a table full of frisky small plates. Scelfo strikes with gonzo flavors. Chickpeas, green garlic, and cocoa nibs surround slices of avocado smoked and then blistered from the grill. Beef neck, roasted to tender submission, collapses over parsnip puree. Crisp corn pancakes act as a neutral foil for other contrasting elements: glossy shishito peppers, trickles of maple syrup, and a couple fistfuls of chewy popcorn.', 'As with any small plates menu, the key at Alden & Harlow is to entertain the palate with a span of textures and flavors. Something crunchy: the chicken-fried rabbit, encased in a panko brick and given a gastropub makeover has become an early signature. Something cleaner: grilled bluefish with pickled fish and a cooling celery remoulade. Skip the mediocre desserts and save the calories for another cocktail mellow with sherry or thumping with mezcal. This is sharply conceived food and drink for unwinding and fueling conversation. It should enjoy the same longevity as its predecessor.']"
343,"[""\n  There isn't a richer starter at any restaurant in New York than adjaruli khachapuri ($16), a freshly baked bread shaped like a world champion wrestler's belt, with straps on each side. In the middle is a chasm seething with melted sulguni, a stark-white and slightly sour cow's milk cheese. On top of that a raw egg is cracked just before the bread hits the table. Your job, if you can suppress your awe for a minute, is to immediately seize a fork before the bread cools and twirl the cheese so that the egg mixes in. Can succeeding dishes compare with this gluttonous and glutenous treat?\n  "", ""New on Bleecker Street, Old Tbilisi has an unusual backstory. Until recently the restaurant was located on Kings Highway in Brooklyn's Gravesend, one of only three places in that borough serving food from Georgia — not the Peach State, but the former Soviet republic. Originating in the Caucasus Mountains at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, the cuisine is a mixture of grilled kebabs, eggplant salads, fortifying soups, steamed dumplings, and casseroles of chicken and veal baked in clay pots. Many dishes incorporate nuts, pomegranates, and large wads of fresh herbs like cilantro and tarragon. One day last year the Brooklyn restaurant shuttered, changed its name from Tbilisi (the Georgia capital) to Old Tbilisi, and set down in Greenwich Village in a region of student honkytonks and small Indian restaurants."", ""The space used to be an eatery devoted entirely to mussels, and after that, one that specialized in sliders. Now the premises are more sumptuously decorated, with a crescent-shaped bar in front open to the sidewalk, and an elongated, dumbbell-shaped dining room. In back, a rocky garden with a cliff and waterfall presents a lovely spectacle. The walls are hung with contemporary Georgian work, including Calder-like smeary village scenes and giant gray canvases showing tortured Roman subjects. All are for sale, with price tags that hover around $2000. Don't even think about it, your apartment isn't big enough."", 'Lula kebab; Megruli kuchmachi', 'Do any other dishes match khatchapuri\'s cheesy egg-bread elegance? Well, sliced into a pair of heavy lead pipes, the ground-lamb-and-onion lula kebab is equally dope. Cooked over charcoal, the thing is smoky and sheepy and comes wrapped in a thin lavash bread that might be mistaken for a flour tortilla. At $25, it\'s an entrée that could easily feed two. (The also-great pork version is $3 less.) Another ""don\'t miss"" entrée, especially if you\'re a fan of organ meats, is megruli kuchmachi ($25), discouragingly described as ""slow cooked veal entrails."" It turns out to be finely minced liver, kidney, and heart in a bubbling casserole prettily scattered with pomegranate seeds. Strangely, it comes with a big bowl of hominy grits, establishing an unlikely connection between our Georgia and the other Georgia.', 'Old Tbilisi seems generally aimed at Russian expats, for whom Georgian food was typically incorporated into menus found anywhere in the U.S.S.R. The restaurant\'s bill of fare includes several Russian dishes, too, including caviar-stuffed cucumber rolls, sturgeon done several ways, and your typical post-Soviet pickle platter, but skip these in favor of ""pxali trio"" ($18). This tongue twister designates three scoops of salads — really, more like bread dips — dressed with walnut paste. Old Tblisi\'s trio deploys eggplants, green beans, and spinach, respectively, each propelled by a different mixture of fresh herbs. For something more familiar, but no less delicious, check out ajapsandali ($14), a close cousin of Sicilian caponata in a serving so generous it threatens to cascade off the elongated rectangular plate.', '', 'Pxali trio', 'There are disappointments, too. Nadughi is three scoops of gritty, mint-laced pot cheese, pretty to look at but boring to eat. And the first two salads in the appetizers section of the menu are paltry things composed of tomato, cucumber, and raw onion, no matter how interesting the dressings sound. Charcoal-grilled kebabs (called mtsvadis) are available at Old Tbilisi in chicken, pork, and lamb, served with pickles and fried potatoes. Unfortunately, these are less delicate and not as tasty as the ones you find in Uzbeki restaurants. With the exception of the lulas mentioned above, skip the kebabs.', 'But do grab the Silk Road dumplings called khinkali (three for $10), especially the ones stuffed with lamb and onions. Note that these are shaped like Shanghai soup dumplings, showing the fascinating concurrence of dumpling shapes along the Silk Road.', '', ""As good as much of the food at Old Tbilisi is, the real utility of the place may be in exposing New Yorkers to some exceptional wines on the all-Georgian list. If you've had too-sweet plonk from this country before, take another look. Teliani Valley's Saperavi ($38) is an intriguing red single-grape varietal on the light side, while Marani's Saperavi Cabernet ($38) is a blend of the same grape with Cabernet Sauvignon, delivering a more saturated punch. The best white tasted was Teliani Valley's Tsolikouri ($38), which flung floral notes with just a hint of sweetness. It, too, represents a single-grape varietal. And since the country is original home to 500 of the 4000 grapes found in the world, we've clearly got a lot more tasting to do."", 'Email Robert Sietsema at robert@eater.com and follow him @robertsietsema.']"
344,"[""\n  After strolling past the street-side marquee for Tavern on the Green, guests might encounter any of the following: brown trampled grass wedged between stones, weathered green wood panels, a quarter block's worth of knee-high weeds, construction tarp, a metal gate that seems to have been discarded long ago, and two giant shipping containers, one of them ajar, filled with what appear to be restaurant supplies. Turns out that $16 million, the reported cost of the most recent revamp, didn't fix everything.\n  "", '""There\'s no one to take you to your table,"" a host said to me last week. ""Would you like to wait here, or would you like to walk over yourself?"" I accepted the more challenging option, and spent the next minute or so wandering through the stadium-sized outdoor seating area until my already-seated colleagues flagged me down. How luxurious.', ""Tavern on the Green is a former sheep barn that Robert Moses, in 1934, turned into what would eventually become one of New York's most famous restaurants, under the management of great names like Joe Baum and Warner LeRoy, and with cameos in films like Ghostbusters and Wall Street. It's one of the few New York hangouts that an out-of-town culinary novices could name with ease, which probably explains why it was once America's highest grossing independent eatery — a title it could very well claim again, as it currently feeds 900-1000 guests on weekdays, and up to 1,700 on weekends."", '', ""There's a gift shop"", ""Those numbers themselves mean the Tavern is a de facto gastronomic ambassador for the Big Apple, an unfortunate phenomenon for a venue whose $22 mac 'n' cheese is real prison slop. And when the waiter upsells you into topping it off with salmon — because what's better than oily fish to pair with cheese-y, mushy, pasta — you'll have spent $32 on what is surely one the worst things anyone can eat outside of Rikers."", ""At the very least, it's good to have one of Manhattan's great spaces up and running again. The Tavern shuttered in 2010 after the city decided not to renew the LeRoy family's operating lease. New York lost millions of dollars under the closure, and citizens of the world lost the opportunity to re-visit a historic space as a proper restaurant. It finally reopened four months ago under Jim Caiola and David Salama, two Philadelphia restaurateurs who are apparently famous for their creperie. The duo's chief gift is the physical overhaul, turning much of the dining room into a glass cube overlooking the park. Hang out here when it rains and you'll experience a profound sense of peace possible in few other places in New York. And then the food starts coming."", '""This could be a turnip. This could be a potato. This could be anything,"" my companion says of the roasted Japanese eggplant, devoid of flavor. Gruyere and goat cheese sandwiches, two tiny halves for $14, boast more grease than a lube job. Mushrooms, nominally affordable at $9, still overpriced because they\'re the same criminis you could find at a supermarket for $1.50. They sit in bowl above a slice of baguette to soak up all the juices. Except there are no juices.', 'Yellowfin tuna with kimchi; Brisket sandwich', 'This is all the type of quasi-global continental fare that one might expect from a Sandra Lee ""Semi-Homemade"" cookbook, not a serious New York restaurant. The chef in question is Katy Sparks, who made a name for herself in the late 90\'s as a chef at Bobby Flay\'s Bolo and Mesa Grill, and then at Quilty\'s, where Food and Wine named her one of the country\'s best new chefs.', ""Perhaps that's why she's still serving grilled yellowfin tuna, everyone's favorite dish from 2001. Ordered medium-rare, it arrives closer to medium-well and is served atop an indistinct mash of ham and beans that is paired, for no reason in particular, with a few strands of kimchi. Call it failed ode to David Chang."", 'Is your food underseasoned? A waiter brings over one of those cute little ramekins that better restaurants use to hold expensive fleur de sel. Here, the elegant cup is filled with what looks and tastes like iodized table salt. Did you order the $45 brunch to ensure quick access to carbohydrates? The included pastry basket, filled with passable croissants and stale pain au chocolat, might not show up for 20 minutes. Tea, requested when your (excellent) grits with chorizo and eggs arrive, might not come until your (absentee) waiter clears the entrees. Sugar? Five more minutes. Exhausting.', '', 'Faroe Island Salmon', 'Not everything is bad. Sparks sends out a great gazpacho and lovely warm squid with a creamy interior and a charred exterior. Striped bass has a crispy skin and a cured salmon platter is fine, likely because the fish is cured at Shelsky\'s in Carroll Gardens (""we don\'t have the capability to do that here,"" a server tells me, and I believe him).', ""Red meat is expensive anywhere, but it actually should taste good to justify the prices. Minetta Tavern charges $59 for its world-class strip steak. Tavern on the Green charges $56 for its so-called USDA prime strip from Lobel's; the aggressively under-seasoned cut boasts no char or funk, chews like leather, and tastes like the gas it was cooked over."", 'And a ""prime"" brisket sandwich is a study in masking the flavor of meat with barbecue sauce. Cost: $28 — over three times more than you\'ll pay for an infinitely better product at Mighty Quinn\'s in the East Village. It should break any local\'s heart to think that an out-of-towner could come here and get the false impression that New York is a rip-off city with bad steaks and crummy barbecue. Even the brownie sundae dessert fails, because the fudge is served cold underneath the ice cream; cutting it requires as much force as slicing a steak. Shitshow?

The opinions among our group of six differed as we began dissecting the meal outside on the sidewalk right afterward. One person mentioned the awkward lag time before a proper greeting: It was 9:15 on a Saturday when we were seated, and the night's service was at its apex. Brazilian samba bounced overhead. (The playlist soon mellowed to Snow Patrol and then somnambulant jazz.) We sat in the center of the boardroom-gone-glamorous, watching the staff deliver entrees or desserts in synchronized sweeps to other tables, or dole out creamy slivers from the cheese cart. Ten minutes later, when we were beginning to mutter about flagging someone down, a server finally approached us."", ""It was a clanging start, certainly. But we eventually received our share of steady, lavished attention. No, for me, the dinner's patchiness started with a friend's plate of hiramasa (yellowtail kingfish) crudo during the first of the prix fixe menu's four courses. It tasted fishy enough that she didn't want to eat it. I took a bite and agreed. The dish also included uni and lardo; the menu didn't list them and it probably should have. Perhaps they're meant to be luxury surprises, but sea urchin and cured fatback are, for many palates, make or break ingredients. And, in this instance, their emphatic presence only magnified the fish's pungency."", 'Foie gras with fresh and fried cherries', ""It was, of course, a shame we were debating the meal's sundry flaws at all. I clearly caught Menton at a transitional moment. It opened in 2010 in the burgeoning Fort Point district (part of the South Boston Waterfront) as the French-Italian crown glory of the Barbara Lynch Gruppo, which includes eight culinary businesses around the city. Lynch, who won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurateur this year, is one of Boston's most respected chefs, deservedly. Her South End paean to pork, The Butcher Shop, is a favorite stopover for charcuterie and pâté, and I lunched happily earlier on that Saturday at her bustling seafood bar, B&G Oysters."", ""In April, Menton lost its chef de cuisine, Top Chef winner Kristen Kish, who'd been in the kitchen less than a year but who'd worked for Lynch since 2010. Scott Jones—another longtime employee who was previously chef de cuisine at Lynch's flagship, No. 9 Park—took the reins."", ""The plates that Jones and his kitchen sent out as part of the four-course, $95 tasting menu (there is also the option of a chef's tasting for $155) were picturesque sculptures of color and geometry. At times the flavor combinations lived up to the visuals. Fresh and fried, almond-stuffed cherries buddied up nicely to a creamy round of foie gras torchon, encircled with duck rillettes and splashed with sherry vinaigrette for sweet-sour contrast. A roasted quail entree most embodied the restaurant's efforts to marry French and Italian cuisines. The plate held ponds of a Ligurian-inspired sauce that melded red wine, chicken livers, foie gras, spices, and yogurt. Chickpea farinata (a small, crisp pancake popular as a snack in Genoa) cradled grilled escargot and was used to prop the bird into various states of repose, like avian Renoir models."", 'Parisian gnocchi; Chilled Maine lobster with bean salad', ""But for every one dish that clicked, there were two that didn't square. Sometimes it was the composition: The chopped fresh legumes (garbanzos, peas, favas) under chilled Maine lobster had a shade too much crunch, and dots of spiced date puree distracted from the lobster's own natural sweetness. Parisian gnocchi, the version made from pâté à choux and then browned, begged for richness in their leading roll. Instead they were relegated to supporting players—fancy croutons, essentially, among crisp radicchio, chanterelle mushrooms, dabs of chickpea puree, and cherries with pickled mustard seeds. Others pointed to execution issues: While cappellacci—pretty, fluted-edged pasta filled with pine nuts and goat cheese—came off as under-seasoned, roasted halibut arrived salty enough that my tablemate didn't take more than a couple forkfuls."", ""That was two dishes left uneaten, and it sent the service staff into high gear. In both cases Meredith Gallagher, one of this year's Eater Young Guns, leaned in discretely to ask if the guest would like another dish instead. When they both politely declined, our server brought out a complimentary bottle of red wine (we'd already consumed two bottles). He was a man who refused hospitality defeat: His ebullience approached mania, with a level of energy that brought to mind Kathy Najimy's nun character in Sister Act. The wine was lovely, as was a plate of cheese we shared, but it didn't make up for the ensuing desserts: A tough little sticky bun surrounded by apricots and fig was particularly disappointing. I was looking less for fireworks than for basic comfort at that point."", 'Brioche sticky bun']"

A bowl of griddled polenta sloshed with red chile sauce, chorizo, and eggs (scrambled work better here) radiates a more aggressive heat.

For my dinner in an hour, he especially recommended the grilled chicken skewers wrapped in shiso leaves, the tonkatsu, and, for a splurge, the two ounces of grilled wagyu beef for $36. The setting for our chat wasn't unusual given where we were: Ten Thousand Waves, Santa Fe's famous Japanese spa nestled in the ponderosa forest just outside of town. Late last year, the spa fulfilled a longstanding wish among locals by opening a restaurant on the property. Now visitors can relax for two or three hours and then enjoy a meal yards away."", ""Izanami is open daily from 11 a.m to 10 p.m., serving the same menu of small plates overseen by Kim Müller, a veteran chef whose previous stints include The Compound on tony Canyon Road in town. Even without a massage and a soak, the restaurant would unwind the senses. A waterfall trickles down jutting stones outside the door. The patio on the far end of the building looks out over the mountains. Paper lanterns emit a silky glow inside. The owners sent Müller to Japan to absorb its food culture, which she translates here faithfully. The flavors are grounded and direct: julienned carrot and burdock root flecked with black sesame seeds; hijiki, the frilly black seaweed, composed in a salad with edamame, English peas, and miso-tofu dressing; a traditional presentation of tonkatsu, panko-breaded pork cutlet, with cabbage and hot mustard and a squiggle of sweet, inky miso sauce. The cook was right about the chicken skewers. The grill's heat subdued the shiso leaf's assertive minty qualities and left the pieces of meat tender but slightly smoky."", 'I bypassed the steak splurge for the gratifying burger gussied up with asadero cheese, caramelized onions, and bacon. Only desserts dabble in Americanization, including a small, moist cake crowned with slivered strawberries, or cheesecake perked with sweet-sour yuzu.', 'Bone marrow', ""Santa Fe may be a world onto itself, but it isn't immune to fluctuating trends: Italian trattorias, the latest iteration of Asian-fusion, and New American strivers come and go just like in any U.S. city. It's been a while since Santa Fe had a charming Gallic bistro, and Charles Dale, a native of France who has cooked locally for years, gives Bouche its creds. He opened the place in February 2013 to steady business. Locals and habitués likely appreciate the break from green chile overload."", ""The kitchen delivers honest, sure-handed bistro cooking. A terrine layered with red peppers, spinach, zucchini, and yellow squash tastes clean and bright, particularly with forkfuls swiped through tomato vinaigrette. A crock of escargot exudes garlic, bone marrow is all textbook unctuousness, and sweetbreads flaunted an exterior crispness that gave way to creamy richness. Crowds huddle near a fireplace in the dining room on chilly nights and spread out on the handsome patio in the warm months. Frankly, it's an earnest place run by a skilled staff, but for visitors with a solid bistro close to home it doesn't need to be on their to-do list. My meal's most vivid moment came from the profiteroles, correct with a tender pastry and cold, quality vanilla ice cream and irresistible in the moment when the server poured over chocolate sauce in grand slow-mo food-porn fashion. That's a dessert worth scarfing down anywhere in the world."", 'Sipping chocolate', ""And speaking of theobroma cacao, this sweet adobe storefront in the center of town makes chocolate truffles and caramels, come-hither brownies and velvety ice creams. But the unique draw is its intense sipping chocolates infused with both Meso-American and European flavors. The former means potions like the Mayan, enriched with coconut sugar, chiles, Mexican vanilla, and enigmatic herbs and spices. From across the Atlantic, the Marie-Antoinette, a sweeter concoction with almond milk, orange blossom water, canella, and vanilla. Arrive earlier in the day lest the best variations sell out. And yes, once you're hooked, the store does sell packaged versions of their drink mixes.""]"

It's the blackboards in every room, scrawled with the names of carnal pleasures in lilting French: foie de veau au girolles, tournedos de cheval aux escargot, saucisse de lapin en salami, steak de gigot d'agneau. It's the slinky knots of spaghetti, ensnaring lobster and bacon in their coils, being devoured at every other table. It's the way an arc of flowing Chablis refracts the dim lighting. It's the chat-up-your-neighbor coziness. And really, it's having seized on a reservation at all."", 'Like many American dining sensations that emerged over the last decade, Canada\'s most famous restaurant began in 2005 with humble aims. Owners David McMillan, Frédéric Morin, and Allison Cunningham had worked in fine dining and longed to be their own bosses. They found investors willing to help them purchase a divey cafe in Montreal\'s then-scruffy Little Burgundy neighborhood. A friend built the bar from hardwoods torn out of an old farmhouse. They christened the place in honor of Charles ""Joe Beef"" McKiernan, a storied 19th-century saloonkeeper who was very much a man of the people. Morin and McMillian would be in the kitchen, preparing food, slightly personalized, that hewed to Quebec\'s bistro traditions. Dishes like foie gras au torchon, Dover sole meuniere, côte de boeuf, and profiteroles.', ""Locals immediately embraced the populist feel: old-timey wainscoting, posters of Bowie and Dylan, a massive bison head that an early customer brought in. As the cooking became more bombastic, while still retaining its Gallic finesse, its reputation grew internationally. Chefs and food writers proselytized. The owners swore they'd keep the place small, but by 2011 they doubled the space (taking over a luncheonette next door they'd launched after Joe Beef's success), cultivated an abundant garden and terrace out back, and wrote an exceptional cookbook."", '', 'Lobster spaghetti; radishes with house-cured ham and pesto', ""Success has not dulled the restaurant's frisson. Jump full-throttle into the scene with appetite and wallet. (The digs may be funky but the bill is not cheap, and it's perilously easy to over-order.) The staff—professional yet gregarious and almost familial—guides you through the menu, which changes constantly but follows similar themes. "", 'Start with seafood from the raw bar. In summer the oyster selection was small but unerring. Joe Beef is known for its meaty spectacles but the warm weather also brought cornucopias like the grand aioli, a plate piled with cauliflower, zucchini and asparagus spears, garlic scapes, and a half a dozen other vegetables with clams, boiled eggs, and garlicky aioli chunky with potato. Radishes lent their peppery freshness to buttered toast lined with velvety house-cured ham and surrounded by loose, mild pesto. ', 'Croquettes like overgrown tater tots shatter to reveal a filling of smoked meat, Montreal\'s answer to pastrami. The signature ""spaghetti lobster-homard,"" with chopped bacon and whiffs of tarragon among the cream and butter, bridges the decadence between retro lobster Thermidor and pasta carbonara. I ordered the restaurant\'s take on the KFC Double Down—lobes of foie gras sandwiching bacon, cheddar, chicken-skin mayonnaise, and a drizzle of maple syrup—and wished I hadn\'t. It may be a moneymaker but it was as vulgar as it sounds. The dinner\'s other surprise letdown was veal tongue covered in shaved turnips that looked like white rose petals. Beautiful, but it was difficult to chew in a way that tongue never should be.', 'The foie gras double down', ""We forgot about the misstep when the lamb's neck landed. It sat on a shallow pool of rich polenta, scattered with slivered herbs and chile flakes and grated cheese, and it looked no more unsettling than a leg or bone-in shoulder roast. The meat was lush—tender and only faintly feral. We'll be seeing more of this on menus soon. Ebullient beverage director Vanya Filipovic kept us flush with Chenin Blanc and other French glories. Be sure to discuss pricing: Two-thirds of the selections leap into the three-digit range. "", 'Dessert closed the meal fittingly, with classic marjolaine (a painstaking, many-layered chocolate and hazelnut cake) and a witty Yule log translated for the season with pistachios and strawberries. Joe Beef does largely manage to meet the absurd expectations that its reputation creates. Montreal has a stupefying bounty of grand eating options, but this is a restaurant around which to build a trip. 2491 Notre-Dame West, Montreal; 514-935-6504; website; Open for dinner Tuesday - Saturday, 6 - 11 p.m.', 'Celery root', ""If the server hadn't pressed it, I never would have ordered celery root in July. But then out came the sex kitten of the vegetable world. Downy folds sprawled on a plate, the usually crisp texture tamed by a dressing taking its cues from bagna cauda. It was a root transformed, celeriac as charcuterie. Alongside the server poured minerally, citrusy Particella 128, an obscure white from Emilia-Romania. With the pairing, the celery root purred even louder. "", ""Le Vin Papillon is the wine bar from the Joe Beef owners, located four doors down from the flagship (and two doors up from Liverpool House, the Joe Beef group's second restaurant). Unlike its older sibling, Papillon doesn't take reservations. In this case it makes sense: A desirable time slot at Joe Beef often requires two months planning. Slip into Papillon's 25-seat slip of a space early or late and though the meal doesn't come with the Joe Beef bragging rights, it is nearly as accomplished. "", 'Cauliflower; Lobster with yellow squash', 'Turn up for the food and wine equally. As at Joe Beef, the menus revolve ceaselessly and the menus and lists appear on chalkboards. Vanya Filipovic oversees the beverage program here as well. (She runs between the restaurants every night via a back alley.) This is where she lets her wine geek flag fly proudest, serving plenty of biodynamic French darlings from Burgundy and the Loire and the Jura, but also lesser-knowns from Slovenia or Georgia (the country) and the occasional New World gems, like a Pinot Blanc from Kerner Estates in New Zealand. ', ""Vegetables, for a refreshing change, dominate the small plates menu ($5.50-$13), though they're accented with proteins in savvy ways. Capers and crisped chicken skins highlight the grilled flavors of cauliflower cooked over a rotisserie. Hunks of lobster mingle amiably with mint, basil, and translucent coins of cucumber and yellow squash. What's astonishing is not just the finesse of the cooking, but how easily so many of these produce-driven dishes play well with wine. 2519 Rue Notre-Dame West, Montreal; website; Open Tuesday-Saturday 3 p.m. - midnight.""]"

The blocks around it house tattoo parlors, consignment shops, hair extension pit stops, and stores like Atomic City Comics and Lady Love, a ""toy lounge."" Among them the restaurant\'s iron-hued exterior looks almost ominous, like it fronts a mafia-run nightclub or a local headquarters for the Legion of Doom.', ""The area probably feels like home to Peter Serpico. He was David Chang's director of culinary operations and opening chef of Manhattan's Momofuku Ko before partnering last year with Philadelphia's omnipresent restaurateur Stephen Starr. And isn't this how Chang's empire started, in the East Village a decade ago surrounded by similar urbanity? It's apparent even from the outside, though, that Serpico is adapting to local culture: Valet attendants loiter outside the restaurant to park cars for $16."", 'Walk through a glassed-in foyer to the black box theater of a dining room: painted brick around the ceiling gives way to slick dark walls full of dinner and drink lists written in precise handwriting. Lighting is last-moments-of-twilight dim. A narrow, oblong wooden table near the entrance comprises the bar—cool design idea. On the opposite end of the space gleams the kitchen, a miniature steel metropolis where the cooks stride around the ovens and diners settle in around the 18-seat counter. Serpico floats among his crew, his eyes mostly down and his mouth set in concentration.', 'Deep-fried duck leg', ""There's no better way to describe the food than Changian—a balls-out collision of popular American, Asian, and modernist seasoned with New Nordic and Italian. Serpico helped perfect the style; he has every right to serve it. In the warm weather order two dishes straightaway: lobes of sashimi-grade scallops backstroking through buttermilk, scattered with poppy seeds, and dotted with chive oil, and a calming bowl of dashi decorated with trompe l'oeil, including gelatinized cubes of crème fraiche resembling tofu and pea pods filled with tiny cucumber orbs."", ""Then home in on dishes that embrace Philly and Pennsylvania tradition. Serpico takes the idea of Chang's now-ubiquitous pork belly buns and switches out the major players. He brines, sous-vides, and deep-fries duck legs and nestles the crackly morsels in hot dog-shaped potato rolls from Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, a beloved and longtime bread supplier out of Chambersburg, PA. They form the centerpiece for a striking tableau on a chestnut-colored ceramic plate also set with a cup of pickles and a swirl of ruddy hoisin sauce."", 'Caper-brined trout with crab', ""Cope's Dried Sweet Corn, a century-old Pennsylvania Dutch product, is cooked and pureed to the consistency of smooth grits and used as a filling for ravioli. The pasta then gets dropped south of the border, landing in a saucy mélange of chorizo, sour cream, roasted onions, and hearts of palm chips marinated in lime. Fun, fun. But nothing beats a soul-revving bowl of filigreed crab dyed turmeric-yellow from pepperoncini, the pickled capsicums that adorn salads in Italian-American restaurants all over Philly. It adds the right vinegary smack to offset the crab, the caper-brined trout filets, and the smoked potato salad that lines the bottom of the bowl. (Lamb ribs soldered, via meat glue, to shoulder meat blazed with Sichuan chiles and soothed with charred eggplant and minted yogurt was a close second favorite.)"", 'Desserts—yuzu semifreddo, a riff on rock road ice cream—felt gloomy for summer. I yearned for peaches or berries while spooning up an autumnal apple cake with warming flavors of charred apple sauce and brown butter. The restaurant needs its own Christina Tosi, the pastry whiz of the Momofuku clan.', ""So where does Serpico fall right now in the must-try Philly lineup? For locals, it certainly delivers some brassy edge to the dining scene, and the chef-owner's kitchen chops are undeniable; it warrants an outing. For visitors and newcomers, I'd say first make your way to some of the city's more homegrown celestials—like Zahav and Vedge—and then head to South Street to experience the curios of the latest New York transplant.""]"
350,"['\n  Driving the ten miles on Woodward Avenue from Detroit\'s downtown toward Ferndale in the northern suburbs lays bare the city in all its disparities. The road leads past the glittery Fox Theatre (with its eight-story marquee flanked by winged lions), Comerica Park where the Tigers roam on their home turf, and the Detroit Institute of Arts that houses its collections in a palatial Italian Renaissance building. Along the street one also glimpses derelict blocks, empty apartment buildings, and poignant markers like ""St. Curvy,"" an abandoned turreted church nicknamed by long-ago parishioners for its winding balcony.\n  ', ""The ride can stir up a blur of emotions. But after dining at Ferndale's destination restaurant, it's easy to feel hopeful for what's next. Torino is an unlikely stage for some of the country's most promising culinary talent. It sits at the bottom of a condo building and opened as an espresso and cocktail bar in 2011. In January 2013 Torino owner Noah Dorfman was introduced to Garrett Lipar, a native of nearby Waterford Township and a young chef with serious wanderlust. Not yet 25 at the time, he'd already powered through positions at New York's Public, Chicago's Boka, and Frantzen in Stockholm, and staged at many other star-chasers, Alinea among them. Along the way, he'd been indoctrinated into the creeds of tasting menus and modernist techniques."", 'Smoked Pike', ""Lipar and Dorfman, energized by their mutual ambitions, decided to go all in. In May 2013 Lipar began serving prix-fixe meals, with the cooks working on an induction stovetop (no gas ranges allowed in the space) in a kitchen no bigger than a coat-check closet at a posh steakhouse. In the first months the menus were three courses for $34 or five for $52 and they changed weekly. New Nordic flavors—flowers and dill cream, a focus on seafood—came into play. Locally sourced ingredients met liquid nitrogen and Japanese smokers. Nothing outré for New York or San Francisco, but radical for Michigan. Diners came slowly at first, but then word started to circulate and the critics began praising. In March the Detroit Free Press named Torino its Restaurant of the Year. Last month Lipar was named to Eater's Young Guns Class of 2014."", ""Skeptical that this might be a case of overreaching greenhorns in a market hungry for some dazzle, I almost skipped Torino. I'm so glad I didn't. It was the most rewarding surprise of my travels thus far. Lipar has the gift for composing tasting menus, drawing on various genres as his own style emerges and evolves. In June, he decided to offer nine courses for $89 and change the menu once a month—a wise choice that allows the kitchen staff to fully master each course."", 'Apricot with nasturtium', 'The first dish of the July lineup was a three-component bento box, each filled with summer squash: gently fermented slivers dotted with milkweed flowers; a battered squash blossom stuffed with pinto beans uplifted by summer truffles; and tiny zucchini, patty pan, and zephyr squashes grilled over a yakatori with sour beer foam spooned over them. Each element had the alchemical touch of a skilled chef: They tasted fresh and true to their essence but also amplified. The dishes grew incrementally more complex as the meal careened on. Apricot slowly simmered in whey turned savory, with verdant blasts from nasturtium flowers and young green grapes that resembled English peas. Asparagus arrived alongside a pool of savory chocolate sauce—a mole for vegetables. Fried eggplant stuffed with roasted heirloom tomatoes became a brilliant riff on moussaka, with warm gazpacho filling in for tomato sauce and honey aioli standing in for béchamel.', 'Suckling pig; strawberry and spruce dessert', ""More protein-driven courses of smoked pike and suckling pig  gave way to the two most modernist creations. First, a sweet-savory palate refresher of shiso-green grape sorbet over compressed cucumber, briny from vinegar and simple syrup and decorated with vinegar gelee and Marcona almonds. It was all covered with yogurt snow, the tableau a reminder that Michigan's cold months are never too far away. Dessert was the evening's most esoteric effort—strawberries with angel food cake ice cream, house-made fromage blanc with macerated spruce buds, and other iterations of spruce and berry in the forms of powders, crisps, and caramels—but the components all merged in a way that satisfied rather than bewildered. As a finale, black garlic caramels and chocolates filled with aloe vera marmalade appeared with a sustaining cup of Sumatran coffee, a wink at Torino's origins."", ""Many liquid pleasures came before the java. Lipar has an advocate on the floor with beverage manager Ian Redmond. Starting off with a cocktail like Nigel's Magic Carpet (jasmine-infused gin, Luxardo Maraschino, crème de violet, sloe gin, and lemon) acclimated the palate for the journey ahead. And Redmond made choices for his $45 wine pairing that coaxed even more out of Lipar's cooking. A minerally Domaine Quénard white from France's Rhône-Alpes helped the stone fruit flavors resurface in the apricot. And he wittily chose a Greek Xinomavro with the tomato-eggplant dish to emphasize its moussaka-like characteristics."", ""This team of emerging talents could surely disband and find success individually in other cities. But their strengths are needed in their home state. Here's hoping they stay put and lead a revolution while Detroit recovers its traction."", ""Throughout the year, Restaurant Editor Bill Addison will travel the country to chronicle what's happening in America's dining scene and to formulate his list of the essential 38 restaurants in America.

These days, the city's modern raw bars serve New England specialties alongside dishes laced with global flavors. I recently bellied up to two of the most popular seafood counters in Boston."", 'Oysters and Jonah crab claws', ""Apparently a dozen of us had the same clever idea: Show up at 2 p.m. for a late Thursday lunch to avoid the notorious lines at one of the North End's biggest draws. Didn't happen. The cheerful server manning the door at Neptune smiled apologetically and told us the wait would be around 45 minutes. This did not surprise my Bostonian friend. To stave off hunger, she suggested we split a square slice of Sicilian pizza (the crust was remarkably light) around the corner at Galleria Umberto. The Neptune server called after 35 minutes, summoning us back for seats at the marble-topped bar."", 'Jeff Nace and his wife, Kelli, opened 42-seat Neptune in late 2004. The place has always maintained an eclectic menu covering a breadth of raw and cooked seafood options. Michael Serpa, Neptune\'s outspoken chef for five years, creates entrees that pull from many cultures: a take on San Francisco\'s cioppino; roasted branzino with feta, olives, and other Greek overtones; maritime ""steak frites"" with yellowfin tuna; a Veracruz-style fish preparation (tomato softrito, cilantro, and green olives) made with Nantucket striped bass.', 'But simple, regional fruits of the sea lure most strongly, because the place crackles with the frisson of a classic American oyster bar. Customers scrunch in together at the counter or along an L-shaped, candy-apple-red banquette. Globe-shaped fixtures hang from a pressed-tin ceiling; sconces flank mirrors with thick, pewter-colored frames. The mad shucking of oysters and clams leaves a seashore tang in the air.', 'Our bartender, capable but not especially warm, slid us a sheet with a dozen oyster selections and a few more seasonal enticements. It listed origins and flavor profiles: Onsets from Buzzards Bay, Massachusetts, for example, were medium size, high in salt, and had a ""seaweed finish."" I appreciated the honest mention that the shrimp hail from Indonesia. We downed eight oysters in quick succession before savoring the dense, sweet meat from Jonah crab claws. Kimchi, the condiment du jour, found its way into a freeform ceviche of hamachi slices over a slick of tomatillo salsa. The straightforward joys of frilly Maryland crab tossed in light Dijon dressing proved more gratifying.', ""As did two cooked dishes. Properly fried Ipswich clams—crisp-chewy, not too greasy, the oceanic equivalent of potato chips—are one of the great pleasures of New England, and Neptune did them justice. And the meal's surprise hit was the johnnycake, a dish that harkens back to European settlers. For its luxury makeover, it was capped with smoked salmon tartare and a thimbleful of California sturgeon caviar and then saturated with melted honey butter. It arrived as an appetizer but it made dessert redundant. And anyway, this isn't a place to linger over sweets. Someone is always anxious for your seat."", 'Oyster platter', ""While Neptune feels timeless, B&G revels in its mod vibe. Hexagon mosaic tiles cover a wall in groovy shades of chocolate and shale. Chandeliers, covered in glass resembling flowers set in amber, hang over tables with a metallic finish. Barbara Lynch's intimate seafood bar, which she launched in 2003, sits partially subterranean on a picturesque stretch of Tremont Street in Boston's South End, and the multigenerational clientele reflects the neighborhood's diversity."", ""Lynch's team—led by chef de cuisine Stephen Oxaal, a New England native—brings in designer regional oysters like Naked Cowboy (appropriately fleshy), Taylor Bay (briny to the hilt), and Little Island (minerally and with cupped shells so pretty you'd collect them on a beach). They're piled under ice in one corner of the center three-sided bar, where one staffer stands tirelessly shucking."", 'But here, a platter of oysters is as much opening salvo as centerpiece. Gulp down a few and then bask in summer with a salad of grilled, sliced peaches drizzled with yogurt and scattered with crumbled feta and golden raisins. Share a plate of golden smoked shrimp beignets, snatched fresh from the fryer.', 'Lobster BLT; Lobster roll', ""Don't stray too far from the theme, though. Chubby cavatelli sluiced with dried tomato sauce and blanketed with Jonah crab? Pleasant enough. But I'm all in for the fried clams, cleaner tasting even than Neptune's and suitable for gobbling with only a squeeze of lemon. As for the lobster dishes, they will cost you, but they are masterful. The chef touches are subtle in the $29 lobster roll (which comes with fries, house-made pickles, and slaw). Bits of celery and mayo merely perfumed with lemon and garlic keep it homey, and the chives, besides adding their glittery green, infuse a delicate onion nip into each bite. The claw and tail meat tumbles out of a hot dog-style bun. The $30 lobster BLT, with the same accompaniments, could easily be lunch for two. It's a towering act of engineering, with two slices of ciabatta sandwiching a generous mound of lobster salad, which is partly held in place by a lettuce leaf acting as wrapper. Not wanting to concede to knife and fork, I had to attack the thing at angles with two hands. The ripe tomato was splayed at the sandwich's base, and with each bite its juices bled more into the bread, creating a pronounced acidic counterpoint. Ingenious.""]"

The meal began, as is traditional in Persian restaurants, with a platter containing sprays of mint and tarragon, radishes, soaked walnuts (to cut the tannins and revive their crispness), olives, and rectangles of sharp feta sprinkled with nigella seeds. These made eloquent accompaniments to the ridged flatbread just yanked from the oven—as did a homey version of kashk-e bademjan, eggplant puree with caramelized onions and Persian whey, which is akin to a thin sour cream.

""Dizi"" refers to a conical stone vessel typical in Iranian cooking: It arrived filled with a fragrant, long-simmered stew of lamb shank, boneless rib meat, white beans, potato, and tomato. The red-orange broth was drained off, brightened with lime, and served in a separate bowl for slurping and dunking. A metal masher came on the side; the idea is to pound the stew meat into a rough puree with a texture akin to pulled pork, and then scoop it all out and spread it on hunks of flatbread with torshi (a garlicky pickle), yogurt, and scallion greens.

A caloric wonderland of a casserole, the Chesapeake region recipe typically includes lump crabmeat folded into mayonnaise and a cream sauce (or melted butter) with seasonings like dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce, sometimes sherry. It was served on its own in scalloped shells or as the capper for stuffed fish.

It enhanced each bite without announcing itself too loudly. Eating it reminded me I was home.', ""Woodberry Kitchen electrified the town when it opened in the rehabbed Clipper Mill industrial park in 2007. It was the most forward-thinking Baltimore restaurant in years; even Washingtonians journeyed to savor the finesse of Gjerde's food. In every mid-size American city last decade there seemed to be at least one chef who led a committed charge toward local sourcing and building lasting relationships with nearby farms. In Charm City it was Gjerde."", ""But something else has changed—deepened—in the restaurant's direction. After my recent dinner at Woodberry Kitchen I went back to my parents' house in the suburbs and rooted through a stack of papers on the desk in my old bedroom. It's not news that food critics swipe menus, but when a meal makes an impression I tend to save the pieces of paper that I shove folded and crumpled into my pockets. I found a menu from my previous meal at Woodberry, during Christmas vacation in 2009, when it was easier to book a same-week reservation at a decent time. I held the old menu up alongside the new one. The differences were obvious. From 2009, the list of dishes boasted global inspirations: fried rice with shitake mushrooms and egg, poutine, sizzling shrimp, pork loin with buckwheat crepes, roasted vegetables with polenta. In 2014, many more options directly reference Maryland heritage: oyster stew, chicken and biscuits, crab cakes with tartar sauce, rockfish in several preparations. There are nods to Baltimore's longstanding immigrant communities, including roasted kielbasa with potato salad and Greek salad."", 'Wreckfish with crab Imperial', ""Plenty of other current dishes—braised beef with grits, whole porgy roasted in the brick oven with tomato rice, five different flatbreads, pea shoots with pickled kohlrabi and tarragon yogurt—sound enticing purely on their own merits. But it is heartening to find Gjerde adapting recipes that engender such a clear sense of place. Other cooks around the country might follow suit. I'm not suggesting that creative minds tether themselves solely to community cookbooks and grandma's recipe box. I think, though, that the next step in the local-seasonal movement is for chefs not only to be champions of the land but also stewards of regional foodways."", 'Gjerde has shown his love for oysters from the Chesapeake Bay\'s estuaries since Woodberry\'s earliest days, but in the last seven years the selections have doubled. We slurped a few saline beauties fresh from Virginia waters and spooned up others simmered in an appropriately simple cream- and milk-based oyster stew. From their shells we scooped out several others that had been roasted and dressed with port cream and smoked ham, or with the house hot sauce, called Snake Oil, made from a local chile variety known as fish peppers. The peppers were once widely used by Maryland cooks but then nearly forgotten. Gjerde convinced some growers to plant heirloom varieties. Their impressive heat waded through Woodberry\'s ""crab pot""—a double entendre for the crock holding hot dip that also refers to the name of the traps used to catch crabs. The dip\'s foundation was quark, similar to fromage blanc, and it was doused with sherry, a flavoring for dairy and crab dishes that stretches back to the country\'s founding.', ""On the lighter side, a thin piece of toast balanced lush hunks of rockfish surrounded by a halo of young chicories, dill, spring onions, and other greens. The meal's single disappointment was the Greek salad, an interpretation that included kohlrabi, pickled green tomatoes (mingled with their ripe red counterparts), slivers of fresh fish pepper, and ricotta subbing for feta. The herb dressing that should have united all these elements was so light that we probably should have sent the dish back: I'm convinced now it was missing altogether."", '""Crab pot""; Rockfish on toast', 'Mindful of their cholesterol (and worried about the lack of concern for my own), my folks urged that we order the chicken and biscuit, a disassembled, defatted version comprising a nicely browned breast angled over braised greens, roasted asparagus and carrots, pan jus, and a tawny biscuit that managed to be flaky and sturdy at once. A similar though sweeter biscuit appeared in the shortcake dessert under a snowbank of whipped cream showered with strawberries.', ""Woodberry's success has brought Gjerde, who grew up in Baltimore, a national platform, including a couple of James Beard award nominations. He's no upstart, though. He and his brother ran several restaurants—including Spike and Charlie's, Atlantic, and jr. (all defunct)—through the 1990s before he started Woodberry with his wife, Amy, and another partner no longer involved. The space's cultivated warmth (craggy brick walls, mottled cement floors, chopped wood stacked on shelves overlooking the lower part of the two-story room) and the staff's efficiency speak to Gjerde's years of experience in the business.

Still, the platter is a rollicking good deal, enough for two to share."", 'In fact, all the entrées at Ecuatoriana are big, which suggests you bring a crowd and pass the plates around. King of the big feeds is the bandeja paisa ($13), which translates to something like ""national tray."" It features a large chorizo split longitudinally and grilled, and a mass of top-round steak, sliced wafer-thin. This multiplies the caramelized surface area of the well-done meat. In a country where the cattle are muscular from climbing up and down the mountains and expensive, too, the thin-slicing is economical and makes for a tenderer chew.', ""Orbiting the steak and sausage like indistinct planets, find a llapingacho – a fat potato patty colored yellow with annatto and stuffed with cheese, an ingredient that's one of the few happy legacies of the Spanish Conquistadores. There's a sculpted mesa of rice with a carrot cross on top, as if constituting a high-altitude helicopter landing pad, a mess of white navy beans, a fried egg with a gooey yolk that threatens to inundate the rest of the platter, and that damn fusilli-bearing green salad again."", 'There are plenty of meal-size soups, too, served with rice or corn nuts at your request. The sopa de mariscos is a tomatoey tour-de-force containing a similar selection as the ceviche mixto, while the caldo de gallina is a tough old hen stewed with vegetables to total tenderness. On the weekends, an expanded roster of soups include the frankly weird caldo de bola – a vegetable soup sporting a brown globe in the middle. Inside the dumpling is a combo of ground meat and boiled egg, which spills out into the soup the minute you cut into it. There\'s a wonderful caldo de pata (""cow-foot soup,"" $10), too, which might remind you of the tonkotsu broth used in Japanese ramen; it\'s gooey and gluey and good for your complexion via the dissolved collagen.', ""Many of the most desirable and unusual dishes are weekends-only, but it doesn't hurt to request them on the other days of the week, when they may appear at random. I loved guatita ($11), a fricassee of honeycomb tripe and potatoes thickened with a turmeric-laced peanut sauce. The patches of digestive tissue are glove-like and not at all skanky, while the spuds are so overcooked they recede into the sauce. The recipe is considered the country's foremost hangover remedy."", ""In fact, a lion's share of the menu at Ecuatoriana incorporates potatoes in some form or other, reminding us that Ecuador and its surrounding Andean countries can boast over 3,000 varieties—a testament to the region's impressive biodiversity.

He was making us a welcome cocktail, a hot and cold iteration of the pisco sour. The first step for the drink: a sorbet made from pisco and lime syrup, frozen in seconds by a modernist cook's handiest chemical element, liquid nitrogen. The freezing mist rolled out of a canister, as thick as fog on a summer afternoon in San Francisco. For a moment the vapors completely engulfed Spero — we could only see his short-sleeved arm continuing to whip the mixture. The drink turned out smashingly—warmed egg white foam melted the sorbet to make it drinkable—and the bit of spectacle relaxed the crowd. The next few hours would be anything but stuffy."", ""Comparing Minibar, José Andrés's 12-seat restaurant in D.C.'s bustling Penn Quarter, to a theatrical experience is unavoidable. The two counters that comprise the dining area angle toward an open kitchen area; diners are also the studio audience. But it doesn't feel so much like The Chew as much as it does a culinary Cirque du Soleil blended with the heady themes of a Sondheim musical—pageantry, but also cooking as wry social commentary. You can spend the night absorbed in the tasks of the kitchen's many cooks, who are always twiddling with pans and tweezers and gizmos. A seductive waft of ham-scented broth may drift from stage right while you're absorbed in a plate of white gazpacho solidified into cubes that resemble tofu. And if you're so inclined, the meal can prod rumination: If familiar dishes are deconstructed and reassembled into something both recognizable and foreign, does it push the eater deeper into a comfort zone or alienate them altogether?"", 'José Andrés at Barmini', 'Questions like that, of course, have been at the heart of this kind of cuisine since the late 1990s, before the term ""molecular gastronomy"" was banned by the cooks who practice it. Andrés helped usher D.C.\'s dining scene into the new millennium with stellar small plates restaurants like Spanish-inspired Jaleo and Mediterranean-themed Zaytinya. The first six-seat incarnation of Minibar opened in 2003 in Andrés\'s now-closed Cafe Atlantico. Conceits like lobster emulsion served in a plastic syringe and mango soup sprinkled with Pop Rocks stemmed from Andrés\'s tutelage under El Bulli\'s Ferran Adrià. The early experimentations paved the way for Andrés\'s restaurant Bazaar, with locations in Los Angeles and Miami, and é by José Andrés, a six-seat tasting menu room that\'s part of the Jaleo in Las Vegas\'s Cosmopolitan hotel.', ""In the beginning Minibar charged $65 per person; today it costs $250 before beverages. I gather from what I've read recently and over the years, though, that I caught the restaurant in its most masterful phase yet. Yes, there were plenty of trompe l'oeil small bites and lab-rat remakes of iconic foods from around the globe. But the progression of 25 or so dishes also had enough substance that I left sated, not merely amused or provoked."", '""Rubber Ducky"" meringues filled with foie gras ice cream; Chicken shawarma', 'Befitting the performance atmosphere, the menu is divided into three implied acts. First came the warm-up of sharp flavors. It started in the front-room lounge, with edible flowers pressed into oblate—transparent potato starch paper from Japan—and brushed with St. Germaine liqueur, rosewater, and fennel pollen. They came tucked inside a guidebook for wild flowers. Cute. Once inside, several tidbits arrived while we sipped our pisco sour: a savory twist on canelé pastries made with Parmesan, pineapple shortbread presented in a tin cookie box, a slice of ""pizza"" made with the oblate paper, and a frozen cup of blitzed Marcona almonds and cream containing whipped queso de Valdeón and passion fruit reduction. The ""dessert"" of this group: an apple-scented meringue in the shape of a rubber ducky filled with sultry foie gras ice cream. The chain of dishes even wrapped up with its own late-night snack, a riff on chicken shawarma swathed in oblate with crackly chicken skin, herbs like mint and cilantro, and a dollop of Greek yogurt alongside dusted with Aleppo pepper.', 'Pasta fusilli / Beech mushrooms with truffle', 'Reset for act two, the heftier plates. This sequence limbered up with an ode to Vietnamese street food—a pig\'s ear, fried chicharrón-style, into a puffy cup holding pork shoulder braised in curry with pickled vegetables, Thai basil, and a dropper of chile oil on the side so we could add our own level of heat. No tricks, just a handful of potent flavors. The technical alchemy showed up most overtly a couple of dishes later with pesto fusilli. The pasta was made from water and gellan gum: Cooks dipped cold corkscrews into the mixture, which formed hollow ""noodles"" that were injected with extra-pureed pesto. I don\'t always go in for these shenanigans, but the faux-fusilli was satisfyingly al-dente and the pesto flavor more intense and direct than the traditional method.', 'Ibérico tendon; Beech mushrooms with truffle', 'I was similarly hooked by a dish called ""Ibérico tendon,"" where noodles fashioned from Ibérico ham consommé and Japanse kuzu root mimicked the translucent chewiness of beef ligament. It steeped in a fragrant caramelized onion broth given body by raw quail egg yolk. And I was astonished in a different way by the next course: espardenyes, or sea cucumber—which I officially proclaim as the ""it"" echinoderm among the country\'s fine dining chefs. I also ate the creature recently at Saison and Benu. Spero said the team that develops the Minibar recipes (which includes Andrés, Spero, and Ruben Garcia, director of research and development) was fascinated by the texture and decided to serve it, draped with bone marrow, well into the meal after trust had been established with the guests. Searing the sea cucumber on a plancha helped assuage its gelatinous chew.', 'Lamb shoulder with whey and dill', ""Spero staged at Noma and worked at D.C.'s Komi, and his experience with Danish and Greek cooking merged in the night's most generous dish, lamb shoulder seasoned simply with whey and dill. A take on After Eight dinner mints, a disc with a liquid chocolate center, closed this portion of the dinner."", '""Foieffle"" at Barmini; Edible flowers with whiskey gummy bottle', 'Then we were whisked into spunky Barmini next door for act three—a series of sweets, including the restaurant\'s version of chocolate dipped Pocky sticks, saffron pâte de fruit, a coconut bon bon encasing raspberry puree and freshly grated wasabi, and a chocolate ""doughnut"" filled with Krispy Kreme ice cream. The evening whizzed by, and the meal\'s breadth impressed: the zigzag between European, Asian, and American flavors, and the balance between modernist and straightforward preparations. Andrés was in town and stopped by to chat with guests before they departed. The night ended as it began—with edible flowers. These came in a bowl encased in plastic wrap, upon which sat two gummy candies shaped like bottles and flavored with aged Japanese whiskey. A fitting nightcap. Curtain down.']"

But at Bar Tartine, where he's co-chef with Cortney Burns, the menu's Asian and Eastern European influences may not immediately pop out on first glance. One might take note of the rainbow trout and brown rice, kale with sunflower tahini, and sprouted lentil croquettes and think: tiresome hippie food."", 'Those impressions dissolve within the first few bites.', 'Nasturtium butter and buttermilk with bread; Potato flatbread', ""First, there's the bread. Don't flinch at the $3 charge for a few thick slices. This is, after all, an extension of nearby Tartine Bakery, Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson's game-changer in the Mission neighborhood that bakes the country's most transcendent sourdough. Prueitt and Robertson opened Bar Tartine in 2005 and installed a 15,000-pound oven during a remodel in 2011, the same year that Balla came on board. This bread—tangy, smoky, crusty but with an interior like set pudding—ruined me for others when I lived briefly in San Francisco last decade. I want a hunk of it to be part of my last meal on earth."", 'There are spreads for the same price as the bread, also worth the cost. A pat of butter comes flecked with chopped nasturtium petals, sitting in a pool of buttermilk verdant from pureed nasturtium greens. A ruddy, glossy paste of lard and paprika is essentially a porcine compound butter.', ""Balla and Burns are DIY freaks. They've received ample attention for the ways they incorporate fermentation—a vital part of bread-baking and thus a natural extension of the bakery's essence—into the foods they serve, but almost every dish has an element they've also pickled, cured, inoculated, or dried. The lard I mentioned? They render it. The paprika? They make that from scratch as well. Their compositions look simple—and pretty, showered liberally with herbs and multihued sprouts—but quickly reveal beguiling depths."", 'Rainbow trout brown rice; Beef tartare', ""The bland-sounding trout and brown rice is actually an exploration of narezushi, a centuries-old Japanese method of preserving fish and cooked rice. Balla and Burns combine rice and trout with lacto-fermented brine left over from pickling. It was an experiment in which they found that the rice takes on the complex flavor of the brine and the fish absorbs some of the rice's nutty earthiness. They finish the dish by simmering the rice in dashi (the broth that includes fermented bonito, which of course they make themselves from fish that Balla's uncle sends from Florida) and scattering bite-size pieces of the trout on top. The textures are creamy and the tastes are clean yet mysterious."", ""Beef tartare is a signature dish, itself a meta-fermentation of techniques and cultural collusions. The bread, draped with silky wisps of lean eye of round, is baked with koji, fermented rice cultured with a fungus that's long been used as a base for soy sauce, miso, and other Japanese condiments. It lends a sweet, salty base note rich with umami—a Barry White rumble that evens out the tinnier tones of freshly shaved bottarga. For creaminess and further harmonics, the bread is slaked with a sauce of shio-koji (a salty version of koji, which I'm banking will be a hot ingredient nationwide in the next few years), pureed potatoes, butter, and beef fat. Presented on a wooden board, the tartare resembles Danish smorrebrod, but the Japanese overtones propel it into a unique dimension all its own."", 'Sprouted lentils croquettes with kefir and cilantro chutney.', 'These sound complicated, but they are immensely comforting to eat, which is why this cheerful, charmingly cramped space on busy Valencia Street is always packed. Know, without thinking too hard about them, that similar refinement and energy go into pleasures like langos—a puffy Hungarian potato bread spiked with sour cream, garlic, and dill—and smoked potatoes with black garlic and an aioli often sharpened with pickled ramps. Spinach, beet sauce, yogurt-like kefir, turmeric oil, and bright cilantro chutney bring substance and zing to the sprouted lentil croquettes. The dish hints at Middle Eastern flavors, the next region that Balla and Burns are gazing toward for inspiration.', ""Bar Tartine's desserts—well, they sparked quite the conversation at my table of four. The kitchen avoids white sugar, finding it one-dimensional. I'm down with that, but I found the fermented notes in the creations like steamed black rice koji cake and a cheesecake made from astringent farmer's cheese a bit jolting. The friend at the table who tends to avoid dessert liked them the most. I prefer cakes and other treats that aren't too sweet but that have satisfying degrees of salt or tartness. In these the sour taste dominates. Something as straightforward as a bowl of ripe, glorious California fruit with homemade yogurt and honey would fall in line with the aesthetic. Or a gentle fruit soup?""]"
361,"[""\n  Filling out expense reports. Putting down lame horses. Ordering ramps or soft shell crabs come springtime. These are all tasks that evoke a sense of duty — the ramps and the crabs more so this time of year. So it's with a degree of skepticism that I eyed a crostino containing both at Gato, Bobby Flay and Laurence Kretchmer's Spanish-tinged Mediterranean restaurant in Noho. In fact I'll go even further: it was a dish I didn't want to order in a restaurant that, thanks to a trio of uninspired meals, I wasn't terribly excited to be in. \n  "", 'And then I sampled the toast and was briefly reminded that The Iron Chef was once quite good at what he did.', ""Too many cooks render their soft shells flavorless in the fryer. Not Flay, who sears them on the plancha, adds harissa vinaigrette, places them on a grilled baguette, and anoints the entire affair with charred ramps. The crustaceans collapse in the mouth with little more resistance than a communion wafer, spilling out their heady oceanic juices, while the bread soaks up any errant liquid, and the oniony ramps reset the palate for another bite. The cost is $15 and it is, without question, one of the few interesting soft shell or ramp preparations I've had in the past half-decade."", 'Inside Gato', ""It's also one of the few interesting things to eat at Gato. The menu boasts shellfish salads with as much maritime essence as textured soy protein and braised rabbit legs ($30) with less pizazz than a Lean Cuisine microwavable meal. Not a whole lot is bad here, just blah, and that brings us back to the discussion of obligation, because Gato isn't really the type of place I'd review if the chef weren't a national celebrity like Bobby Flay. Most of the food is about as affordable and forgettable as at many of the city's neighborhood joints that scratch by on good will, good service, a few solid dishes, and lots of walk-ins."", 'Gato, on the other hand, books up many of its prime time slots three to four weeks in advance, revealing that a certain class of New Yorkers apparently thinks about white bean dip with pita 30 days out (""Better make a reservation!""). Most of my own meals, in turn, occurred at the U-shaped counter for walk-ins; bartenders could usually rustle up a few seats for me and my companions in 30 minutes or less. Those bartenders also make some ghastly potables — from watery gin cucumber cocktails to medicinal (and flat) French 75\'s.', 'A friend who dined at Gato recently told me a host asked her the following curious question: ""Are you Bobby Flay fans?"" It was surely innocuous small talk but it\'s also something I\'ve never encountered at, say, The French Laundry. ""You guys must be big Thomas Keller hounds, right?"" In other words, Gato is aware of the chef\'s draw. Come in on any given night and you\'ll see him in the kitchen, cooking.', '', 'Trio of Bites: Beef crudo, white anchovies, tuna stuffed piquillo', ""Long before Flay became top Food Network Talent, he was the acclaimed young chef behind Mesa Grill, which he opened in 1991 and where he introduced many of us to ancho chili powder and other spices of the Southwest (it shuttered last year). He also opened Bolo in 1993, a three-star New York Times Spanish restaurant that partly informs some of the food at Gato. Flay still serves Bolo's seared duck liver in his new Noho digs, a dish that, when you get past all the nostalgia, ranges from overcooked to over-sinewy."", ""The Iberian food scene, alas, is different than it was in the 1990s, or even the early aughts, when Bolo was in its prime (it closed in 2007). We now have fine spots like Tertulia, taking its inspiration from Asturias, Aldea, representing for Portugal, Toro, doing the pan-Spanish thing with panache, and La Vara, tipping its hat to Andalusia and the country's historical Sephardic and Moorish populations."", 'Cauliflower; Pizza', ""Flay casts a wider net, serving tuna stuffed piquillo peppers alongside chile-spiked Greek yogurt and Roman-esque flatbread pizzas ($16-$17). It's all average enough fare that ends up doing about as much for the Mediterranean as Tao does for Asia and Lavo, for Italy, which is to say not a lot. Call it a summer blockbuster of a restaurant, where safe flavors reign supreme. Flay's calamari with favas might as well be seitan with favas, and his garlic shrimp ($15) are perfect for those who prefer their crustaceans to taste as if they were genetically crossbred with styrofoam."", ' It does about as much for the Mediterranean as Tao does for Asia and Lavo, for Italy, which is to say not a lot.', ""Like any proper blockbuster, Gato, with its 3,640 square feet, is a large, well-oiled machine. Bartenders work their way through the crowds quickly and with aplomb; their heavy pours of wine help too. For those with reservations, expect around two feet of space between the tables — not quite Eleven Madison Park-style business class but definitely economy comfort. Gato might be one of New York's least cramped casual restaurants."", '', 'Scrambled eggs', 'Still, I\'ll sit at the bar, order a $13.50 Rioja ""Biga"" Luberri (served at cellar temperature), and pair it with Flay\'s stunning scrambled eggs ($14), which get a whisper of heat from Calabrian chili oil and a hint of funk from goat cheese. Then I\'ll try the crab risotto ($18), which is decent as a crab dish, less so as a risotto — the arborio grains are overcooked. Also overcooked is the octopus, whose wilted exterior shows little sign of having been crisped on the griddle. The insipid tentacle is edible enough as long as you stay away from the tangerine sauce, which is about as tasty as a frozen can of orange juice concentrate.', ""That brings us to perhaps the biggest flaw in Flay's food: his propensity for sugar, and not in a smart agrodolce way. He tops his chorizo with apricot mostarda — which in the right hands can balance the fruit's sweetness with a sinus-clearing sting but here is all candy. His blue cheese-topped strip steak, boasting gorgeous char on four sides, is slathered in a honey-spiked red wine sauce that would be better suited for pancakes. Even the tarte tartin, with all its complex caramelization, makes the throat well up from sugar shock just like a Cinnabon."", ""It all makes me wonder whether Flay is sometimes catering to an Applebee's or TGI Friday's crowd, where guests with a high tolerance for sweetness expect bland meats to get their kick from the likes of Jack Daniel's glazes and such. Then again, there's no accounting for Gato's cumin-scented pork porterhouse, whose flesh contained about as much swine flavor as a can of supermarket tuna. And the tarragon chicken, with little trace of fat, tasted like what happens if you cooked the bird by leaving it out in the sun for a few days."", 'Paella, ""Fettucine""', 'Stick with the crab crostini and the eggs, as well as the beef tartare, which stings of pickled fresno chiles. The go-to entree is the kale paella ($27), where crusty calasparra rice packs a world of deep mushroom flavor. Pair that with the carrots — an epic roast of earthy, vegetal awesomeness ($10). The squid ink pasta is decent too, not for the heavy handed squid ink, the limp ""fettucine"" [sic], or the guacamole-like green sauce, but rather for the two giant carabinero shrimp. They alone would justify the $34 price tag.', ""You can and should skip the ho-hum desserts, but you'll be sent out some sweets whether you like it or not. The petits fours are undercooked biscotti meant for dipping in sweet sherry. Yawn. In this exceedingly boring year for New York City restaurants, Gato might be proof that boring is precisely what the public wants.""]"
362,"['""I believe that Japan and Italy have a great deal in common,"" chef Chris Jaeckle tells me and he proves that ballsy assertion by making delicious food at a restaurant called All\'onda.', 'He goes on: ""The roots of these cuisines take food and manipulate very little. It is based on good ingredients cooked simply. They are almost entirely surrounded by water and have mountainous regions, etc."" It\'s enough to make me wonder what kind of wonderful and wacky pasta this guy will toss if he ever visits Iceland or Madagascar. In the meantime Jaeckle gives us parmesan dashi with tomato oil and ricotta dumplings. There\'s your tortellini en brodo, baby.', 'The broth is nutty while the tomato is just strong enough to let you know it\'s there. The hot soup has the same roundness as anything made with meat or MSG and the pasta\'s eggy filling has the density of a good American custard. If a hip spot on the Lower East Side like Ivan Ramen put it on the menu it would sell out in an hour, because it\'s obscenely delicious and it\'s probably something a stoner would crave after hitting the bong a few times — ""Cheese Soup With Cheese Pudding Dumplings!""', '', ""Alas, I regret to inform you that Jaeckle, late of Ai Fiori, took it off the menu. As packed as All'onda gets on any given night, no one was ordering the parm dashi, I'm told. Such are the risks of doing something different, especially in this normcore era of eating out where mid-level continental restaurants and steakhouses are cloning themselves at such a rapid pace that Hollywood's recycling of the Spiderman franchise feels slow by comparison."", '""Very few people are willing to step outside of the common Italian box and I never really understood why,"" says Jaeckle. He\'s right. As New York\'s high-end French and American venues play around with modernist techniques and international ingredients, our Italian spots continue to thrive, for the most part, in their more rustic or ethnic incarnations. And when things do get fancy, it\'s typically in more of a conservative, buttoned-up way, like at the excellent Del Posto or Marea.', 'Of course, we\'re slowly getting more open-minded about things. The Major Food Group is doing pretty well for itself spinning old-school red sauce fare into kick-ass tasting menus (and spendy raw fish bars) at Torrisi and ZZ\'s. Chris Cipollone is moving the conversation forward at Piora, tipping his Italian hat towards South Korea with his gochujang octopus. And now we have All\'onda, where Jaeckle re-textures polenta into vegetarian ""pork rinds"" — meant for scooping up meaty shards of baccala — and where he treats bonito flakes as if they were truffles, shaving them over veal glazed sweetbreads, imparting a whisper of tonatto savoriness to the vitello.', 'Jaeckle, who\'s a partner at All\'Onda with Jeffrey Chodorow\'s son Zach, calls this ""Modern Venetian cuisine."" That\'s probably a smart move; you don\'t see Jean-Georges Vongerichten or Cesar Ramirez referring to their three-Michelin-starred flagships as Asian-inclined French spots on their websites. Anything that smells of fusion can clear a room.', '', 'Tuna with wasabi and preserved tomato', ""All the All'onda action takes place in a bi-level space on 13th Street, just across from Corkbuzz. Nice company, right? Head upstairs for the quieter room, with exposed brick and wood environs. Or stay downstairs, where you'll find me at the shouty bar, cooling off with an icy Moretti ($6) and digging into raw hamachi, where pepperoncini and salty soy show off the fish's natural fattiness."", ""Jaeckle's crudo kung fu is strong. He dials down the oils of sardines with fennel-saffron puree here and pine nut relish there. He paints crimson tuna green with sinus-clearing wasabi and finishes the treat with salty black olives; gotta bring it back to the Mediterranean, right? Just one gripe, and Mother Nature might strike me with lighting for saying this: Jaeckle uses yellowfin for this preparation. Sustainability issues aside, it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as bluefin. So be it."", 'Lumache with aged duck ragu; tortelli with short rib', ""Pastas, rightly portioned somewhere in between appetizers and entrees, sometimes boast Asian touches. And sometimes they don't. A bowl of garganelli, studded with sweet chunks of peekytoe crab and sporting an undercurrent of heat, seems normal enough until you taste the sauce, which has more tang than tomatoes. Is it yuzu? It sure is, or yuzukosho to be exact, a chile paste made with the rind of the flowery Japanese citrus."", ""Lobster risotto is flawless, chock full of good fish fumet and cleanly tasting of the namesake crustacean. Mortadella agnolotti, a rich baloney sandwich in pasta form, is slathered in house made XO sauce — a funky mess of sopressata with dried shrimp and scallops. There's your Michelin star right there."", ""Then we have smoked uni bucatini. It's agreeable enough if you eat in 30 seconds flat; wait too much longer and the carbonara-like sauce starts to take on the texture of Elmer's glue. SELL."", ""Around this time you might run into a bespectacled New Jersey guy known as Chris Cannon who, like Jaeckle, was once a key player in the nascent Italian restaurant empire now known as the AltaMarea Group. Here at All'onda, Cannon helps out with the excellent wine list. You'll be well off with a variety of lean whites and light reds, none of which exceed $17 by the pour, even for the sparklers."", '', 'Squid ink monkfish', 'An easygoing Pinot Nero ($14) or even a fizzy Lambrusco ($15) will take you through the squid ink monkfish, as ugly as it is tasty, and packing the same ""cuts with a spoon"" texture of a scallop.

I\'ll take it.', 'The dorade over chickpeas are fine, as is a somewhat above-average guinea hen (with foie gras sugo) and pork chop (with smoked apples). My advice: go for the beef, the good looking guy at this dinner party.', ""Jaeckle charges $52 for his strip; it reeks of dry-aging and rendered kidney fat. The flavor is clean and sweet and continues throughout the chew, without the blue cheese musk that can turn off entry-level carnivores. Is it a hint under-seasoned? That's what the veal reduction dipping sauce is for. And now you know why it's pre-sliced. Chopsticks, please!"", ""Just as good is the football-sized short rib for two ($62), sous-vided for 48 hours to keep the insides nice and pink. Need a vegetable with that?

Skip the icy apple sorbet and the gelatin-heavy fennel panna cotta. Affogato, stinging of good rum, will get the job done. No, All'onda isn't exactly Osteria Francescana, Massimo Bottura's avant-garde playground in Modena, nor should it be. Jaeckle pushes the envelope just enough to keep things interesting without alienating."", ""Better to think of it this way: As Jaeckle's former bosses at AltaMarea keep pumping out more of the same at their Italian Restaurant Replicating Factory, All'onda wants to bring us something different. That's no slight on the people of AltaMarea; they've set a high bar for hospitality and I'm jealous the citizens of Tajikistan will get a Morini sooner than we'll have a Second Avenue Subway. But what our own city's culinary scene needs right now is an increased tolerance for creativity and risk, and that's why All'onda is so vital."", ""Update: An earlier version of this story stated that All'Onda was on the same block as Gotham Bar & Grill, which is located on 12th Street."", 'Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.']"

She was raised in New Haven and now lives in nearby Wallingford with her husband and three children. We delivered them eight boxes worth of leftovers. ""Look, kids—apizzas!"" said MaryLee, pronouncing the last word as locals do: ah-beetz. The trio swarmed the dining table and started flipping open the cardboard tops. The oldest one, who is 10, went straight to the box that read ""The Original Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana."" Then he looked up at me, his eyes set in an appraising squint.', '""Did you go to Sally\'s?"" he asked.', '""Not yet,"" I said. ""It\'s only open for dinner. We\'re headed back in a couple of hours.""', '""Sally\'s and Pepe\'s are the best,"" he pronounced, reaching for a slice with clams and bacon.', ""That's a popular opinion, and one I agreed with by the end of the day, though of course I needed to find out for myself. The merits of New Haven-style pizza are well documented: Eater published a definitive guide in March as part of Pizza Week 2014. I'll skip the origins and lexicons, then, and simply recap my experiences through the five area pizzerias with the largest reputations. Rather than sampling the same toppings at each place in an attempt at pseudo-scientific analysis, I instead ordered each establishment's signature pies. I ate no bad pizza that day, though my favorites were easy enough to rank."", ""We stopped first at Modern, started in 1934, purely by proximity: It sits a mile away from Wooster Street, the stretch of Italian-American businesses that includes Frank Pepe and Sally's, and Modern is closest to the highway. We arrived shortly after it opened at 11 a.m. The booths in the first of two dining rooms were nearly filled but the place was surprisingly calm.

By national standards it was standup pizza: The cooks pull the thin discs, bolstered with breadcrumbs on the bottom that scorch appealingly, from an open flame brick oven. The lip is puffier than the others I tried, the crust chewier around the edge. We went for the restaurant\'s famous Italian Bomb, loaded down with crisp curls of bacon, pepperoni, sausage, onion, mushrooms, garlic, and strips of red and green peppers—with just enough ""mootz,"" the native verbiage for mozzarella. We ate quickly, before its center sagged too heavily from the weight of all those ingredients. A clam pie tasted bland, leached of the usual brininess.

At Modern, I'd tried the legendary birch soda from Foxon Park, the preferred beverage brand in these parts. I hadn't gulped that antiseptic sting of wintergreen since childhood. Now I switched to Foxon Park's Gassosa, a lemon-lime sparkler much friendlier to food. We ordered the house salad in a feeble stab at healthiness. It was a perfunctory muddle of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage and olive. All of the restaurant's life force flows into the pizzas—as it should."", 'The staff hacked our two lopsided beauties into irregular slices; some were triangular, others rectangular. It was so rich with Italian umami that I didn\'t care about the shape. The tomato pie with mootz was a prototype for the ""plain pizza"" we all know, with the border of acidic-sweet red sauce and the golden specks of baked cheese, which mirrored the larger splotches of char that seared smokiness into the crust. Remarkable. Pepe\'s clam pie was my one previous foray into New Haven dining. This time I added bacon, which mimicked the clams\' texture and stoked their saline qualities.

A quail egg, moored by a dollop of preserved ginger, had been lightly smoked in tea and brown sugar and set in a moat of smooth cabbage and onion soup scented with bacon. Rousong—pork braised and then dried, also known aptly as ""meat floss""—was scattered over the egg to give the dish a bit of chew. Bright, rich, soothing, varied: This warm-up nudged the taste buds to attention.', ""Then the true kindling of the senses began. An ornate black vessel arrived containing one elaborate bite. It resembled siu mai, the open-faced dim sum dumpling usually filled with pork and shrimp. This version was stuffed with pork belly, diced kimchi, and a tiny oyster on top. The wrapper looked cast in amber—a technique from the modernist playbook in which kimchi broth was set with hydrocolloids to give it body and then dried until pliant. By the time it reached the table it was akin to edible glass. In one bite the wrapper crackled into tingly shards before dissolving, leaving the soft burn of kimchi and the proteins' crisscross of earth-sea flavors. My tablemate and I looked at each other wide-eyed and laughed. What would be next?"", ""Many, many pleasures, from a mind that stands alone among the country's vanguard of fine dining. Lee—36 years-old, born in Korea, raised in New Jersey—felt the call of refined cooking early. He worked in Pied à Terre and La Tante Claire in London before he was 21, moved to New York for stints in the kitchens of Daniel and Lespinasse, and then spent nine years with Thomas Keller. He was the chef de cuisine at The French Laundry before he opened Benu. What Lee gleaned from Keller was a confidence in his upbringing as a culinary bedrock. Keller famously took Americanisms like mac and cheese or peas and carrots and reconstructed them using Escoffier's techniques and California's bounty. Lee has fashioned a coexistence cuisine that honors both his Asian and American selves. It takes mettle. Upscale renderings of sea cucumber and salt-and-pepper squid don't pack the reservation books quite like pasta snowed under with shaved truffles does."", 'Not that Benu is empty. A mix of casually dressed tech types and suited Asian businesspeople kept the restaurant humming and the people-watching prime on the night I dined there. But it is easier to snag a table here than, say, Saison, or certainly The French Laundry.', ""Beggar's purse; Oyster, pork, and kimchi dumpling"", ""And yet, for seasoned diners, I'd currently recommend Benu for a splurge over all the other blowout restaurants in the Bay Area. The cost is on par, perhaps slightly more reasonable by comparison, with other high-rollers: Tasting menus, the only option, are $195 per person. (The French Laundry starts at $295, though that price includes service.) More importantly, the food at Benu bridges East and West like nothing I've ever tried before. Unlike his peers, who often look first to Japan among the Asian nations for inspiration, Lee looks primarily to his native Korea and to China. His rigorous, brainy cooking has become more grounded in those countries since Benu opened in 2010. Then, he may have slipped sweetbreads or risotto into the sequence. Those types of dishes are less frequent now, which makes meals even more of a mind-opening delight."", ""Much of what sets the restaurant apart is the Asian emphasis on texture. Of course all chefs think about textural contrast—the handful of breadcrumbs over spaghetti, a sprinkling of candied walnuts in the salad. But in Lee's kitchen the tactile sensation moves to the forefront. Take a chicken-based soup that appeared halfway through the meal. The star ingredient was wild bamboo fungus, which in its natural state resembles white asparagus stalks and has a consistency that brings to mind tripe and honeycomb. It hit the palate slippery but then snapped between the teeth. The effect fascinated and its umami earthiness gratified."", ""Ditto Lee's take on shark's fin soup. The prized part of the swimmer was always more about its feathery elasticity than its flavor. Mindful of the way shark species are endangered by brutal fishing practices, Lee employs more modernist lab work to approximate the fin, which he serves in a bowl with Dungeness crab, custard infused with Chinese ham, and a broth perfumed with truffles and ginger."", 'XO Sausage with basil curd; Salt-and-pepper-squid', 'I loved the studied way our meal unfolded. The soup and the engineered dumpling introduced us to Lee\'s mindset, and then a progression of finger foods followed: Eel in crisp feuille de brick pastry, a riff on spring rolls, with a blob of crème fraiche for swiping. An angular sliver of celery capped with caramelized anchovy and peanut. A spoonful of silky tofu made with sunflower miso. A metal skewer impaled with sausage made from pork and dried scallops and shrimp, with a square of basil-infused bean curd. A luxe beggar\'s purse of ""treasures from the oak,"" marrying acorn flour (a prominent ingredient in Korean cooking) and a filling of Iberico ham from pigs that were fed acorns and truffles that grow under oak trees. Genius! Then a play on salt-and-pepper squid—a crackery squid ink rice ship dotted with a gentle confit of squid, garlic puree, pickled chiles, and cilantro shoots. The progression was startling and fun—and with minimal exchanges of silverware, it made for a gracious balance between service interaction and our own engaged conversation.', 'Sea bream with aged tangerine peel', ""The thrilling juxtapositions never let up. Soup dumplings awash in lobster coral were also laced with clarified butter, evoking the American penchant for lobster with drawn butter. Aged tangerine peel brought a citrus intensity to a tiny sea bream that enhanced without overwhelming. An optional sea cucumber course for a $25 surcharge brought texture to spare, stuffed with a shrimp mousse that emphasized the creature's spongy texture rather than masking it. Ballsy, and also rewarding. Hot mustard and fermented Chinese black olives gave roasted quail, the most Western-looking of the dishes, a distinct Asian pungency. Lee has access to sake lees (the byproduct of making the beverage) due to connections with sake producers in Sacramento, and he paired the fruity, cheese-like ingredient winningly with strawberry sorbet. The finale brought a pale orb of fresh and dried tofu skin—imagine the al dente bite of a fruit rollup but milkier—filled with almond and white chocolate. Glorious textures right to the sweet conclusion."", ""Four years into Benu, Lee is now tackling other projects. In the next month he'll open Monsieur Benjamin, a return to Lee's roots with casual French cooking. And though he doesn't yet have a location, Lee plans to next launch a Korean barbecue restaurant. Jason Berthold, who has cooked at The French Laundry and Per Se among others, will be chef de cuisine at Monsieur Benjamin, and Brandon Rodgers, also a Laundry alum, watches over Benu's stoves as chef de cuisine. They help free up Lee to work on his new ventures, but I hope he doesn't stray far. The energy he puts into his flagship now makes Benu one of the country's most extraordinary—and enlightening—dining destinations.""]"

It was 9 p.m. on a Saturday. The front door guy, Stephen, winced on my behalf when I inquired after a table for three. ""You\'re looking at 11:30,"" he said. My optimism for any less of a wait, I knew then, had been as masochistic as it was delusional. Chef April Bloomfield and restaurateur Ken Friedman\'s first venture—the tiny, cluttered, well-funded West Village upstart (Mario Batali and Jay-Z were among the original investors)—imported the no-reservations gastropub from Britain ten years ago. The bedlam has never quieted.', 'I put my name down nonetheless and drifted outside to call my would-be tablemates en route. ""Oh, didn\'t I mention?"" said my friend Kim from a cab. ""Earlier we were at the Breslin""—Bloomfield and Friedman\'s sister gastropub at the Ace Hotel in Chelsea—""and we asked our server if she could call over to the Pig and add our name to the list."" I dashed back inside. ""Oh, you\'re with that party?"" said Stephen. ""Yes, I\'ve got your table."" He led me to a choice perch—a roomy booth against a red and blue banquette. The scent of potted herbs along the windowsill on the left collided midair with the wafts of garlic from the kitchen to the right. I could not have been happier in that moment than if I were a Disney character at the end of ""Frozen.""', 'Carrot and avocado salad', ""The British and Italian cooking at the Pig has grown more attuned over the years, though no less intense. All chefs worship the holy trinity of salt, fat, and acid, but Bloomfield is a charismatic who speaks in beef tongues. That comes through not just in her most overt dishes, including the famous fried pig's ear with its lash of mustardy lemon-caper dressing. The first dish of our meal was a pureed asparagus soup cloudy with crème fraiche, resembling a picture of earth from space, only green under the swirling wisps. The seasonings were so amped, with the vegetable's taste both heightened and diffused, that each spoonful left us marveling and wanting more. The same right-to-the-edge approach made a modest bowl of champ—an Irish staple of mashed potatoes and scallions, here subbed with ramps and fluffy from butter and milk—one of the evening's most soulful bites."", 'Pork rillettes', 'Rabbit leg', ""But a palate can fatigue and an appetite rebel from a constant assault of richness, so it's crucial at the Pig to suss out a few counterpoints. Sodden pork rillettes with mustard and pickles? No. A salad of carrots and avocado, one of the night's specials? Yes, yes, particularly welcome with its juicy grapefruit segments and a cumin-forward dressing that lifted the ingredients into Moroccan realms. And another special, a subtle braised rabbit leg, emerged as the night's sleeper hit buoyed by a verdant supporting cast of fava beans and fiddlehead ferns. I ordered the burger more for context—the patty that launched a thousand imitators and derivations—but, even in our ground-beef-saturated land, the mix of short rib, sirloin, and brisket topped with strong Roquefort stays mighty in the memory."", 'The mix of short rib, sirloin, and brisket topped with strong Roquefort stays mighty in the memory.', ""Of course the Pig's very essence makes it as much about drinking as feasting, and the liquid vices tempt from all angles: a Guinness stout or a dry Sorachi Ace saison from Brooklyn Brewery; cocktails like the Commonwealth Cup, a gin and tonic given a broader depth of field with cucumber, lemon, a splash of ginger ale. My chums wanted wine; a ready-to-quaff Brezza Barolo held its own with the food. It was near midnight when we waded through the packed bodies, the Pig oinking as loudly as it was when I first walked in. Amazing how a place so tiny has come to loom so large."", 'Tosca Cafe', 'Bloomfield and Friedman have shifted lately into empire-building mode. They\'re actively looking for another space in New York (with some recent hitches) beyond the four Manhattan restaurants they already run, and there were brief rumors about the duo opening their first venture in Los Angeles. Their western expansion already began early last year when the two took over Tosca Cafe, an almost 95-year-old bar in San Francisco\'s North Beach neighborhood. The smoke-stained joint hadn\'t served food since the 1950s, and its signature drink, popular during Prohibition, was the coffee-less ""house cappuccino""—Ghirardelli chocolate and steamed milk with a shot of brandy. Bloomfield and Friedman shelled out $1.5 million to build out a kitchen, restore the old-timey murals, and replace red vinyl booths and stools with crimson leather.', 'Tosca\'s clientele had dwindled before Bloomfield and Friedman came in, but Tosca relaunched in October and the two-hour-plus wait last Saturday night—a week after my meal at the Spotted Pig—felt mighty familiar. (Jostled schedules compelled me there that evening; I\'ve otherwise learned my lesson.) Four of us wedged into the slinky, 45-seat bar before dinner. The new team reinvented the ""house cappuccino,"" now a concoction with Armagnac (a hot ingredient in cocktails this year, I\'m noticing), bourbon, ganache made from local small-batch producers Dandelion Chocolate, and organic milk. Fun, though I preferred the herbal-earthy Choke Hold with tequila, Cynar, Carpano Antica Formula vermouth, and Maraschino.', 'Caesar salad', ""Bloomfield's menu, in keeping with the North Beach's Italian heritage, looks to the Boot for inspiration. The cuisine isn't a leap for her. She learned her craft at London's River Cafe and spent time in the kitchen of Berkeley's Chez Panisse; both of those restaurants draw heavily from the Italian repertoire. But the first plate to hit our table, cubes of gelatinous oxtail terrine topped with a handful of parsley salad, was pure Bloomfield food: unctuous, saline, acidic, balanced, potent. Sliced red chilies and a flurry of pecorino took the tired Caesar in feisty new directions. The kitchen also gave grilled polenta a fresh look, searing firm chunks until the edges were dark and smoky and tossing them among meaty mushrooms, blobs of mascarpone, and grated Parmesan."", 'Bucatini', 'Lamb ribs', ""The three pastas on offer showed unusual restraint. A bowl of linguine with asparagus and green garlic was all springtime and simplicity. Bucatini didn't go overboard with the guanciale and chiles tangled into its tomato sauce. A variation on cacio e pepe with twisty gemelli pasta arrived a bit gummy, though the straightforward flavors of pecorino and black pepper kept our forks returning to the plate. We didn't order the much-discussed roast chicken for two, nestled on toast smeared with ricotta (it takes an hour to prepare); we finished the meal instead by gnawing down herb-speckled lamb ribs and then sharing a square of tiramisu lightened by a finishing douse of grated orange zest."", 'San Franciscans often famously reject outside restaurateurs.

San Franciscans often famously reject outside restaurateurs.

The restaurant eventually absorbed the plant store. In 1987, after chef Kathy Riley left to have a baby, the owners convinced Rodgers, who was then cooking in Manhattan, to take over the kitchen. By kismet, Rodgers had been placed with the famed Troisgros restaurant family in France as a high school exchange student; it sparked her curiosity for French and then Italian cooking. She came to care more about the foods that people consume daily than the twinkling pinnacles of the Michelin three-stars. Her specialties reflected it. She realized the potential of the restaurant's Caesar salad, and she roasted chicken in the brick oven that the owners installed soon after she came on board: It became her defining dish. She was among the first to go gourmet with the humble burger, grinding the meat in-house and sandwiching the patty on grilled rosemary focaccia with just-garlicky-enough aioli."", ""A meal at Zuni feels like a homecoming, even if it's your first time.

The warm bread salad underneath—zinged with currents and pine nuts and scallions—slurps up the chicken's juices like turkey stuffing.

Burrata over smashed English peas on toast with mint and black pepper. A straightforward, feel-good spinach soup with crème fraîche and tarragon.

The hottest restaurant on South Beach doesn't serve ceviche and  caipirinhas but rather green papaya salad, drunken rice noodles, and  fish roasted in banana leaves. Khong River House, steps away from  tourist-clogged Lincoln Road and takes a heady detour into the flavors  of Thailand, Laos, and Burma. It turns out that a Southeast Asian  torrent of chile and lemongrass and fish sauce cuts through Miami's  muggy nights thrillingly."", '', 'Khong River House', 'Inside Khong River House', '', 'To create the interior, at once transporting and thoroughly American,  Kunkel rearranged scores of everyday Thai objects into a chic, moody  saloon. Collages of woods in every shade cover the walls: They came from  crates and pallets shipped from Thailand. Corrugated metal sheets line  the ceiling, a nod to Thai shanties. Sturdy, surprisingly comfortable  chairs were fashioned from beached riverboats. Traditional bamboo fish  traps dangle over the bar, doubling as light fixtures. Thai motorcycle  license plates line the stairway leading to a private dining room.', ""The menu slides between cultures with a similar ease. Thai cuisine  aficionados won't find quite the fierce street-food cooking channeled at  national standard-bearers like Portland's Pok Pok and Los Angeles's  Night + Market. Thai cooks in the kitchen stay a true course, though,  cranking out a deft mix of funkier delights but also offering the  soothing curries so familiar at Americanized Thai restaurants."", ""Kunkel had a nasty spat with Khong River's opening executive chef, Piyarat Potha Arreeratn (known as Chef Bee), who is opening his own restaurant, Naiyara,  later this year. That said, the dishes I tried recently at Khong River  were punchy and prepared with skill. Beef jerky, an Isaan (North Thai)  staple, acclimated the palate with its pungent fish-sauce twang and a  dipping sauce that warmed, rather than incinerated, the taste buds. It  came with a cooling clump of sticky rice. The dressing for a green  papaya salad didn't shy from the classic, sharp zigzags of tamarind,  lime juice, garlic, palm sugar, and a whiff of dried shrimp. I loved the  hit of dill in the snapper wrapped in banana leaf: The herb is used  more in Laotian cooking than Thai. Among the tangles of noodles,  adventure seekers should dive into the brothy boat noodles (beef blood  is among the ingredients); the crowd pleaser is the soy-slicked,  basil-flecked drunken rice noodles."", '', 'Salt-encrusted whole fish', ""There's no alcohol in the drunken noodles (it's ideal drinking fare, hence the name), but the cocktails and spirits at Khong River rival the quality of the food. As temperatures begin to soar around the country, I'll be craving the Tippecanoe: Spring 44 Old Tom Gin (made in Colorado) with Earl Grey syrup, lime juice, and freshly pressed honeydew melon juice. Its fine calibration inspired me to sip through a gin flight from Holland (the favorite: Nolet's.) At the dinner's end, imbibe appropriately with a shot of Mekhong, the Thai herb-infused spirit made from sugar cane and rice that recalls both rum and sake but is a singular product of its place.""]"
368,"['\n  If you frequent restaurants that require those increasingly rare commodities known as ""reservations,"" it\'s likely you\'ve mastered an urban skill as difficult and in demand as computer coding. That skill is punctuality. Arriving on time in New York, after all, isn\'t so much a passive courtesy as it is a stressful, chess-like effort in self-mobility. \n  ', ""And because dinner often begins simultaneously for everyone at chef's table restaurants like Brooklyn Fare or Blanca, I like to think of being on time as an act of personal sacrifice for the collective good. Not that anyone's waiting; show up late and the meal will (justifiably) have started without you. The key, however, is that the enforcement of punctuality shouldn't come at the expense of making people happy. This is the hospitality industry, after all. And that brings us to the case of Nakazawa, an excellent sushi spot that might have fallen on the wrong side of that equation, at least on a recent visit when I was running behind. "", ""Custom dictates that guests arrive at any given restaurant within 15 minutes of a reservation; yet within those first 15 minutes, Nakazawa staffers (and the chef) asked my dining companion about my whereabouts three times. Only after a second location-based query was she offered what most level-headed waiters offer guests when they arrive: a beverage that isn't water. I apologize for my tardiness — due to a duo of broken Citi Bike docks — but really, a restaurant's job is to make a guest feel comfortable — never the opposite."", ""Some might say I'm nitpicking. I'll counter that when you're spending $500 for two and vying for a reservation a month in advance, you want to feel coddled, not stigmatized, and the more you spend, the more such flaws are magnified. And for what it's worth, I arrived at Nakazawa 16 minutes past the reservation time. Yes, these ignominies were forgotten after we reckoned with raw scallops, as sweet and ethereal as French Îles flottantes. The mollusks were spiked with an aromatic yuzu-chili paste and served over a mound of rice so light it seemed not to exist. Perfect. "", ""Then we experienced sake service that ranged from excellent to craptacular. So that's the bad news: Hospitality problems can persist throughout a meal at Nakazawa. The good news is there are few flaws in the fish. Nakazawa is already one of New York's better and more fairly priced sushi spots — no small achievement for a venue that's less than a year old. "", 'You probably know the story. Alessandro Borgognone, the co-owner, is a 33-year-old Staten Islander who used to cook at Patricia\'s, his family\'s restaurant in the Bronx. He discovered the 36 year-old Daisuke Nakazawa while watching him in ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi,"" a documentary detailing the painstaking work that goes on behind the scenes at three Michelin-starred Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo. Borgognone lured the chef from a posting in Seattle and in August the duo opened Nakazawa in Manhattan\'s West Village. ', ""It instantly became one of New York's most difficult reservations. "", ""Like at Jiro, Nakazawa serves a single product: Sushi. But unlike Jiro, where dinner is ¥30,000 (~$293 USD), things are a heck of a lot cheaper in New York. The price is $120 if you're dining  at one of Nakazawa's 25 dining room seats, with 21 pieces of nigiri served in flights. Those who sit at the gorgeous marble bar will pay $150 for the same meal, with most of the nigiri served one at a time. "", 'What accounts for the $30 price difference? ""We\'re definitely pricing on demand,"" Borgognone tells me. He correctly asserts that guests (myself included) are willing to pay a premium for the theater of watching Daisuke rip the head off a live spot prawn. ""Sayonara time,"" the chef quips, before personally serving you the glistening crustacean. You pick up it with your hands and eat it; be sure to savor the jelly-like texture as it slide down your throat; this is a maritime gummy worm. Lovely. ', 'Then a waiter tries to pour tap into your sparkling water. Not so lovely. ', ""Of course, sitting at the bar is more than just theater. Sushi is best consumed seconds after it's prepared, with the barely cool (or room temperature) fish being gently heated by the warm, vinegared rice. Borgognone rightly (and politely) admonishes diners who snap iPhone pics of the prepared sushi; there's no photography ban here, he just wants you enjoy the golden eye snapper right after it's blowtorched, with the fishy oils still oozing out like a pat of melting butter on toast. "", ""Timing is all the more important with Daisuke's toro hand rolls; eat them instantly and the nori collapses with less resistance than a good soufflé. And while the nori wrapped around sea urchin wasn't as crisp as it should have been, you don't mind the oversight much because the Santa Barbara uni had such a crystal clear musk of the sea I'm halfway convinced Daisuke has figured out how to dry-age the orange roe like steaks. "", ""What makes Nakazawa a satisfyingly uniform experience is that the head chef personally serves everyone at the bar — a pleasure that's less common at, say, Ushiwakamaru, where a ninth string sushi chef making spider rolls for the dining room was charged with preparing my $150 omakase a few years back. And at a recent meal at Tanoshi, which didn't cost too much less than Nakazawa, the backup chef started serving me mid-meal using a separate, somewhat mushier stash of rice. That won't happen here. "", ""There are also no choices at Nakazawa, and that's something to keep in mind. One of the great things about Manhattan's best sushi restaurants is that dinner is often a dialogue, an interaction between the chef, who asks for preferences, and the guest, who lets the kitchen do most of the driving while putting in a few humble requests. At Nakazawa, the meal is monologue. You sit down and the food starts coming, perhaps a slice of banded grouper or sea bream with kumquat zest."", ""This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I've long been a proponent of no-choice menus at Alinea or Atelier Crenn. The question you have to ask yourself, however, is whether you view Daisuke's take on sushi, which emphasizes the more neutral and subtle flavors of the sea, to be a compelling enough narrative to warrant such restrictions. I'd argue it's more exciting to develop a relationship with a good chef like Masato Shimizu of the Michelin-starred 15 East, who can push you outside of your comfort zone while indulging your preference for say, oily and more strongly-flavored silver fish. In other words, Nakazawa isn't necessarily a great choice for regulars looking for a more bespoke experience."", ""What also isn't great: When you pick up your first piece of sushi (cherry salmon, served too cold), you discover there's no finger cloth to wipe the remaining rice off your hands — a waiter corrects the oversight a minute or so later after you look around in confusion."", ""Sake sommeliers sometimes do their jobs; they explain that you're drinking a Junmai Kimoto with nice acid; it matches well with richer fish like the clean horse mackerel or the umami-rich saba. Sometimes the sommeliers don't do their jobs; they pour your pairing, utter an unfamiliar name and and walk away before you can even make eye contact or discuss whether it's to your liking. And for those who'd like to peruse the wine or sake offerings in advance, sorry, there's also no online list. "", ""Borgognone mentioned during a phone interview that diners are free to order more food after the end of the set menu; that courtesy, common at other omakase sushi spots, was never extended to me during my visits at Nakazawa — perhaps it's incumbent upon the diners to ask for a second round, which can be a tough proposition when all of a sudden Daisuke drops your dessert sushi and takes a bow. "", ""It's not what you'd expect from a four-star restaurant, which Nakazawa most definitely is not. Everyone is pleasant enough and and the food is great, but just as punctuality is slightly more complicated than showing up on time, hospitality is more than being nice. It's about the steps of service and getting them right. It's a skill. And here, that skill needs honing."", 'Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.\r\n\r\n']"
369,"['\n  First, a brief history of tapas bars in New York. In the late 1930s as the Spanish Civil War wound down, leftist refugees (paradoxically known as ""Republicans"") streamed into Greenwich Village, eager to tell their stories of Fascist persecution. Many started Spanish restaurants there and in surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to formal dining rooms, many of these places — including Rio Mar in MePa and El Quijote in the Chelsea Hotel — boasted dark, red-upholstered barrooms where the odor of garlic wafted through like an ocean breeze. While the dining rooms were busy peddling massive servings of paella to hungry, cash-strapped bohos, the bars served snacks to homesick Spaniards, including grilled sardines, flaming chorizos, and poached octopus washed down with wines, sherries, and sangria.\n  ', 'Numbering perhaps two dozen, these combo restaurants and tapas bars dominated the city\'s Iberian food scene for 60 years, until a startling event occurred. A decade ago Mario Batali launched Casa Mono (""Monkey House""), a newfangled type of tapas bar with no restaurant attached, serving regional Spanish small plates with Italian twists. The orange-clogged dude also took what had been a placid institution and added a new level of theatricality, allowing you to admire a cook flipping coxcombs on a broad griddle. And Casa Mono elevated the runny poached egg to a pinnacle it would never descend from.', 'Not long after Boqueria debuted, named after a Barcelona market. If Casa Mono was a carefully constructed one-act play, Boqueria was a three-ring circus. The minute you came in the door, there was a gal madly slicing things in the front window, and the entire place — which featured raised tables and felt like an airline departure lounge — was constantly abuzz. But though small plates of charcuterie, bread dips, and pan con tomate attracted the most attention, these places and the imitators that soon followed insisted on backsliding on the promise of a real tapas bar by offering full-blown entrees that competed with the small plates.', ""These two establishments begat the modern New York tapas bar, where you were invited not only to graze but to sit down and eat a full meal. But with international attention currently swinging from Catalonia's Ferran Adria to the Basque country's Andoni Luis Aduriz, it was inevitable that some new restaurant would want to chuck the sit-down menu and take these institutions back to their roots in the famous pintxo bars of San Sebastian. That place is Donostia."", ""Located at the northeast corner of Tompkins Square Park, Donostia is the Basque-language name of the city and tourist mecca of San Sebastian. In case you didn't get the message, an antique map of the Basque territory is repeated three times on the wall. The bar is gray-splotched white marble. The lighting consists of tortured metal globes like an eagle's talon in the deep narrow barroom, and a nifty chandelier made of wine glasses in a semi-private room toward the back. A third room allows tapas eaters to survey the bare-bones food prep area. With the facade flung open in fine weather, the place takes full advantage of the park, and there's nothing quite like sitting at one of the raised tables in front drinking a glass of sweet sherry and nibbling a pintxo or two as the sun sinks behind the Temperance Arch."", ""The function of a real tapas bar? It's a place to have a drink or two in the evening and a handful of snacks selected for their sharp flavor and eye-appeal. The food represents a hunger-deterrer, not a meal. The same implied advice pertains to Donostia: Have a drink or two, but don't try to eat dinner, because if you do, you'll be disappointed. But as a place to snack and explore the alcoholic beverages of Spain, Donostia is unparalleled. The food menu sprawls across two folio pages in a whopping 17 categories, but is reducible to a small collection of dried, pickled, and canned ingredients repeated in several small-plate formats. Don't expect any of the current dining tropes of fresh, local, or sustainable to be observed. This contrariness alone makes Donostia worth visiting."", 'When you first arrive, stick with Banderillas (""flags,"" $2 to $4), delightful toothpick-borne combinations of one or two bites, and Montaditos ($2 to $6), open-faced sandwiches of three or four. In the former category be charmed by gilda: two green olives and two pickled peppers skewered with an anchovy – a pintxo that originated in San Sebastian in the 1940s named after a Rita Hayworth movie; and chorizo picante: a single slice of spicy sausage, a wedge of aged manchego, and a streamer of pimento. These banderillas look like miniature chivalric pennants carried into a battle of flavors. The montaditos are similarly compelling, edible bread-mounted sculptures on which you might find a dab of salt-cod puree, a tentacle of octopus, brine-pickled cherry tomatoes, blue-veined cabrales cheese, a baton of eerily white asparagus, or the best canned sardine you\'ve ever tasted.', '', ""You can also discover culinary nirvana in the Pates section, which means in one instance a glass crock of whipped artichoke dip flooded with olive oil and served with a small flock of toasts. Another high point are the weird-ass sandwiches made with a pair of tortilla wedges, one example with a filling of creamed leeks and spinach constituting the menu's biggest feed. You also can't go wrong with the charcuterie assortment called plato de carne y queso ($20). A friend who's spent time in San Sebastian noted that the tapas bars there whet your hunger with trays displaying snacks stacked on every available surface. While our own health department prohibits this sort of sumptuous display, the bar at Donostia features several selections on cake-display platters under glass. You could do worse than ignore the confusing bill of fare entirely and adopt a point-and-eat strategy."", 'Ultimately, the menu at Donostia is more about the booze. That part of the menu is a didactic document with voluminous special sections for red and white wines, ciders, beers, sangrias, and sherries (wonderful fortified wines that run from bone-dry to raisin sweet). Sampling the full range of beverages at Donostia could take a lifetime. My advice: Get started!', 'To misquote an adage, ""Good things sometimes come in twos,"" and that is true of Basque tapas bars in the East Village. Not long after Donostia opened, an olive\'s throw away on First Avenue a place called Huertas (""Orchards"") appeared, also claiming to be a Basque tapas bar. The interior makes artful use of dark woods and antique mirrors using bare brick as a backdrop. Huertas attracted lots of attention by its method of addressing the visual display problem by creating something called ""passed tapas,"" whereby pintxos would be placed on trays and carried through the barroom ($2 to $4). These were available in addition to medium-size dishes called raciones, which could be ordered from the kitchen.', ""Huertas has a beautiful gilda, too, with a little more emphasis on the anchovy, and individual mussels escabeche awash in white vinegar and chopped aromatics. The only dud here was the spongy hake croquette resting in a puddle of indifferent garlic mayo. There tend to be eight passed tapas listed on the chalkboards, and an additional 10 raciones, plus charcuterie and cheese, making the menu in the front room much easier to digest than Donostia's. As an added boon, some of the sea creatures featured are fresh and imported from Spain. Foremost in strangeness are percebes, gooseneck barnacles that look like a baby alien that has just gnawed its way through your stomach. The flesh squeezed from its neck is sweet, but the price of four or five small specimens priced at $13 is too steep. The best dish among the raciones is something called migas, featuring tidbits of duck and croutons tossed in a verdant green sauce, with fresh pea shoots on top.  Brilliant! Fresh is not a dirty word at Huertas, as it is at Donostia."", '', ""The list of Spanish alcohol is much shorter at Huertas; nevertheless, there is good cider, sherry, and vermouth (the latter on tap), and the barman is well versed in the selections available. Then there's the back room, which is reserved for a single prix-fixe meal ($52) in the faddish modern style, which flies in the face of the tapas tradition, though it serves as a reminder you're in the East Village rather than San Sebastian — as if you'd forgotten."", '', ""Lucky for us, the four-course feed via chef Jonah Miller verges on the superb. It begins with radishes served with whipped parsley butter as a prelude, then progresses to the first course: three small pintxos, including, on this occasion, a gilda, a toast with an agreeable puddle of foie gras, and a single mussel escabeche served in a soup spoon. The second course is a variation on the duck and pea-shoot migas of the raciones menu. So far, the meal has been a triumph, but it threatens to run off the rails with the third and largest course, which is not quite big enough to qualify as an entrée. This is the first course offering a selection of three, and my dining companion and I enjoyed a sliced duck breast with greens and golden raisins in a broth that threatened to be sweet, but wasn't. Less satisfactory was a grease-sodden vegetarian rice dish featuring pickled mushrooms squiggled with mayo, presented in a miniature paellera, suggesting once again that tapas bars shouldn't meddle in main dishes. The final course was a return to fine form, with three choices, from which we picked a pair of small cakes draped with pickled rhubarb and a cheese plate offering three bang-up selections with membrillo and a dab of honey."", 'Taken as a pair, Donostia and Huertas give a good idea of what dining in San Sebastian might be like, without jacking up your frequent flyer miles. Thus, your best bet is to graze at both places in succession, which I did one evening with a promenade around the park in between. Then went home and cracked open a book about the Spanish Civil War.', 'Email Robert Sietsema at robert@eater.com and follow him @robertsietsema.']"

But the first place I recommend when asked for dining advice in the nation's capital hasn't wavered in almost a decade. Zaytinya opened in 2002 and is my favorite among chef and restaurateur José Andrés' dozen restaurants. (His newest, a reincarnation of his elaborate pop-up America Eats Tavern, opened earlier this month at the Ritz-Carlton in nearby Tysons Corner.)

Groups I've been with tend to gorge early and then regret ordering the last dish or two that appear. But I want tastes of it all: the unusually fine-tuned spanakopita, a Mediterranean umami blast of spinach, feta, and crackly phyllo; sultry shrimp in a bath of lemon juice, mustard, and dill; oozy kolokithokeftedes, fritters that make humble zucchini crave-worthy; lamb chops zapped with capers and tempered with smoked tzatziki. Servers push the brussels sprouts glossed with garlic yogurt and barberries; but in warmer weather veer to seasonal ideas like seared halloumi cheese offset by cubes of watermelon, tomato, and mint. If there's room for dessert, I rarely deviate from the parfait of vanilla scented Greek yogurt, Muscat-soaked apricots, apricot sorbet, and crushed pistachios—with a small cup of chalky Turkish coffee to jolt me out of my stupor."", 'The only drawback to Zaytinya (Turkish for ""olive oil"") is its cavernous size: For the coziest setting, ask for a table in the back on the second level, up a calorie-burning set of stark white stairs.', '', 'Frutti di Mare', ""DC cabbies are still figuring out exactly where to drop off passengers bound for Fabio Trabocchi's third restaurant, a new looker on the edge of the Potomac River down the hill from Georgetown's clogged thoroughfares.

Plenty of Washingtonians know it well already: Since opening in February it's become the hangout du jour for the city's elite."", ""Trabocchi hails from the Marche region of Italy, near the Adriatic Sea, and the menu is one long psalm in praise of seafood and pasta. My pal and I had busy dinner schedules and swore earlier we'd eat a light lunch. Didn't happen. We started by tackling the frutti di mare—one of those iced platters heaped with oysters, mussels, clams, beady-eyed prawns, and now-ubiquitous uni that evokes the kind of languid beachside vacation that few of us have time for. Trabocchi's showmanship can sometimes lead to excess: A soft-shell crab appetizer was breathtaking to behold but scattered to eat. The crab played hide-and-seek among a bouquet's worth of edible flowers, pesto, blood orange segments, and, for good measure, a few hillocks of trout roe."", '', 'Softshell crab', ""Spaghetti with clams, emerging as a signature dish, was a model of simplicity. Littlenecks in their shell surrounded a coil of noodles in a seafood broth, dotted with roasted tomatoes and kindled with bright Controne chilies. Risotto—gilded with lobster coral butter and finished with calamari and cod tripe in tempura batter—proved so rich that dessert was out of the question. At the end of the meal we meandered through the restaurant, lapping in the details: a marble bar with a pattern resembling a white cheetah's coat; azure blue banquettes by the windows that pop against the main room's brown and gray shades. Handsome front and back bars flank the space. It's easy to see why the power-suit crowd flocked here immediately."", '', 'Escargot hushpuppies', ""Escargot are a thing in D.C. Perhaps they're a holdover from the French bistros that dominated the city's dining landscape for decades. I spotted snails on menus of every style and breadth—even crusted in potato and served with spiced yogurt at Zaytinya. Mintwood Place, in the eclectic Adams Morgan neighborhood, drops them into an even more unlikely medium: hushpuppies. It works as a study of textural opposites, the fried cornmeal's craggy terrain versus the snail's earthy chewiness. The tarragon in the aioli alongside is a wink to France and also coaxes out the fritter's briny qualities."", 'Chef Cedric Maupillier cooks without borders: He nabs ideas from all over the map, with results that are considered rather than forced.

He\'s replaced by his younger brother, Philippe. Charles Jr. had presided over La Grenouille for much of four decades; his departure caused a titter among New York society types. (When I emailed the restaurant to ask if Philippe was thinking about making changes, this was the wisecrack response: ""He said he plans on putting in a pool hall and bordello."") We three may have had no previous context with the restaurant, but we were still curious about the quality of its timeless (anachronistic?) cooking.', '""This is the best smelling restaurant I\'ve ever been in,"" said Sietsema, motioning to the lilies and cherry blossoms streaming out of huge vases.

Meanwhile, the finesse of La Grenouille\'s food was surprising us at every course. Sweetbreads over hen-of-the-woods mushrooms had been sautéed to exterior crispness and interior creaminess, and foie gras terrine with brioche and fig compote was textbook luscious. The shocker among the starters was Sutton\'s assortment of cold salads: asparagus, cucumber, julienned celery, ratatouille, cherry tomatoes, shrimp in rémoulade, and cold-poached salmon with pesto. This could have been a throwaway dish, a concession to dieters, but each element on the plate had been prepared with thought and precision.

The place is an antidote to many modern restaurant notions, though I found the decoration—the searing orange color and humongous flower arrangements that threatened to consume entire tables—somewhat over the top. And those annoying little lamps at each table. The cord on ours interfered with me crossing or even itching my legs; there was no way to deal with it other than straddling it.', ""Really, the prix fixe wasn't that much more expensive than at a modern Fort Greene bistro, though all the supplements [additional costs for dishes like the foie gras and the soufflés] definitely increased the total. The wine list was great, but that's another place where you end up spending more money than in a bistro."", 'One of the best parts about dining with you guys was finding out we all had different tastes in food. I loved Ryan enjoying the caviar; I would have just as soon put it in a pea shooter and taken aim at some of the other guests, who often seemed like cartoon characters. I guess we did, too.', 'Pike quenelles', ""Sutton:The pike quenelles were stunning: They were like the îles flottantes of fish. I eat a lot of caviar. It's one of my favorite things in the world (I probably have my Russophilia to blame). I can say without qualms that was one of the best composed caviar dishes I've had in quite some time, and it's the most significant portion of sturgeon caviar I've witnessed without having to pay a supplement for it."", ""I like my soufflés just a hint drier and a touch less eggy (though on the scale of things, I'd say I still like my soufflés eggier than most), but these were awesome. My ideal is Shawn Gale's buckwheat soufflé from Saison in San Francisco."", 'The other dessert was the oeufs a la neige, essentially îles flottantes. If the pike quenelles were like ile flottante, then the oeufs a la neige were like the dessert version of blanquette de veau, pale and creamy and soft.', ""I found the restaurant a bit more expensive perhaps than Robert did. At $104, this is one of the city's most expensive three-course prix-fixe menus, even without supplements. Generally speaking, dinner at, say, Momofuku Ssam Bar or Hanjan, with a few shared plates, plus drink, tax, and tip, will cost me $100 max, and often closer to $70 or $80. After supplements, tax, and tip, Le Grenouille can easily approach $200 per person if martinis and wines by the glass are involved."", 'Still, I think Le Grenouille was definitely ""worth it."" Even though the standard meal is three courses, we had a nice leisurely repast that wouldn\'t have been a whole lot shorter than, say, the tasting menu at Momofuku Ko. And while I\'ll take a longer tasting menu over an expensive three-courser any day, because that\'s just the way I like to eat, Le Grenouille made me unwittingly remember the loveliness of short-form gastronomy. I really want to bring my parents here.']"
372,"[""\n  On July 17, 2012, Ivan Orkin, perhaps the only Long Islander to become famous for running a duo of Tokyo ramen joints, hosted a one night pop-up at Momofuku Noodle Bar in Manhattan's East Village. The doors unlocked at 5:30 p.m. and shortly after 6 p.m. I was told there would be no more Ivan-brand ramen left because half the city, apparently plagued by a mid-summer flu pandemic, thought it would be smart to order hot soup on a 91 degree day. Sure, the sell-out was part hype (and part damnation of strict seasonality), but it also showed that New Yorkers wanted better Japanese noodles — and more of them.\n  "", ""Now, two years later, the Big Apple is well into the throes of a ramen revolution and helping to lead the charge is Orkin himself, with a sit-down restaurant on the Lower East Side and a leaner pay-before-you-eat outpost on the Far West Side. And amid our glut of good gluten, you can pretty much walk into either without a wait, though we'll revisit that statement come December."", ""This is all good news because the full-service Ivan Ramen on Clinton Street, at just six weeks old, is already slinging out some of New York's most enjoyable noodles as well as a slew of righteous small plates. Case in point: Orkin lets diners wrap sheets of nori around morsels of slow cooked pork, roasted tomato, and sushi rice. Believe me when I say that if the $450 per person Masa ever wanted to drum up more business it could do so by putting these umami grenades on the menu. They cost $6 for two."", 'But before we get too involved with all this deliciousness, it\'s worth dwelling on the awesomely short queue a bit longer because really, waiting two hours for ramen makes about as much sense as booking a spot at your local slice joint a month out. Ramen, however underpriced it might be — a $15 entree whose complex components require a heck of a lot more effort to make than a $59 steak —  is still spur-of-the-moment ""I\'m hungry"" food. And given the vast quantities of salt and fat you\'re ingesting, sometimes a three-hour tasting menu\'s worth of calories in a single bowl, perhaps it\'s best not to think too much about it at all.', ""Though it can be hard not to. Take Orkin's outstanding spicy ramen, a mix of dashi, chiles, and chicken broth, all studded with bits of pork and toothsome rye noodles. It sounds simple and the texture is rustic but it has the depth of flavor you'd expect from a fancy French sauce that some guy spent half his life learning to make. And then there's the heat, which lights your GI tract ablaze like a Roman candle going off in both directions. I dare you to eat it on a first date."", ""Or consider the triple-garlic mazemen, a style of whole wheat ramen where the ratio of broth-to-noodle is closer to Italian pasta than a can of Campbell's. Orkin roasts and distills his garlic to such a level of sweetness that Mark Ladner could sell this perfectly al dente dish at Del Posto for twice as much and no one would blink an eye. But since the world deems this delicious product to be cheap, Orkin charges just $15."", 'No, none of this is terribly revolutionary, not here at least. While Orkin rose to fame in Tokyo by breaking the rules, he\'s now competing in a city that excels in just that, where great traditional noodles co-exist with very good Americanized ramen. There\'s Dassara in Brooklyn, which spins a gnarly ""deli ramen"" out of what\'s essentially matzoh ball soup. There\'s Ippudo in the East Village, which produces a tonkotsu so milky I\'m certain each bowl results from putting an entire wild boar\'s worth of fat through a commercial juice press. There\'s Benkei on Delancey, where the chef won\'t let you order his fine seafood ramen (or anything else) until well after midnight. And of course there\'s Momofuku Noodle Bar, where David Chang sells a vegetarian chickpea creation that might just be the single most revolutionary ramen dish in New York right now.', 'So what makes Ivan Ramen vital in this competitive environment for starch and soup? Its ability to bridge the gap between the new and the old and deliver on both sides of that coin with solid service. Orkin can slay you with his shio (salt) or shoyu (soy sauce) ramen just as much as he can with that garlic mazemen, a flavor so distinctive it should be eligible for the same trademark protection as a Cronut.', ""The best seats are at the counter, where you'll see the cooks working away. Look above them for a backlit comic strip, with a woman, a cowboy, and a happy monster all slurping up noodles. There's also an outdoor garden and it can fill up quickly — New Yorkers won't be denied their al fresco eats even if it means sweating into their soup."", 'The ramen takes time to come out (as it should) so start with something cold and sour. Chinese broccoli with sweet soy pickled garlic will get the job done just fine, as will XO pickled daikon, with spaghetti-like strands of the radish coated in scallop chile oil and bits of dried shrimp. The flavor profile is fresh but it should also be salty and funky, which it is not, and that brings us to one of the quirks of Ivan Ramen: Orkin has an occasional tendency to dial down strong flavors.', ""Thousand-year-old eggs, a Chinese dish where eggs are preserved in ash and lime for months, are traditionally valued for their pungent, sulphuric aromas. Here at Ivan, the delicacies are deviled and taste as neutral as that suburban American staple. Fried chicken livers and hearts are a fine study in crispy, snappy textures, but the meat is bland; there's no irony punch here. The milder approach works better for scrapple, a Pennsylvania Dutch breakfast meatloaf known for its restrained organ-meat overtones. Orkin nails that flavor profile dead-on, pressing pork shoulder, chicken liver, and buckwheat into a savory, offaly waffle, with bits of apple and maple mayo keep the richness in check."", ""Things get more turbo-charged with the ox tongue, whose assertive, rated-R beefiness needs the accompanying hot mustard and soft broth to keep things PG-13. Fried shrimp, often an ode in taste and texture to Amazon.com's packing materials, is 100 percent maritime bliss at Ivan Ramen, with the squirty heads still attached for sucking, and shrimp powder added on for oompf. And kudos to Orkin for amping up the oceanic aromas to 11 with his ankimo dirty rice, a gorgeous platform for the gentle sting of scallion and the high-tide tang of warm monkfish liver. It's a brilliant study in surf and earth."", 'Now it\'s time for the noodles. One of my well-fed dining companions, a musician who refers to himself as a ""ramen whore"" perhaps said it best: ""The shio and shoyu are classic and can be taken down in a heartbeat."" I pass along that comment because you might see certain ramen experts with no concern for their blood pressure slurping down two bowls at once in 10 minutes flat (to enjoy the broth at its hottest and to avoid overcooking the noodles) — I\'m more of a half-a-bowl in 20 minutes type of guy. If anything, I\'ll argue the shio tastes better when cooler, as it allows the bonito it\'s made with to shine through more clearly.', ""Shoyu, in the earlier days, had the color of molasses and all the daydream-inducing complexity of the soy sauce it was made with. But Orkin now uses a lighter product with a shallower flavor. It's not bad, just not as good. Triple garlic, shio, and spicy chile ramen are the smartest moves here, while the four cheese mazemen is a fine Japanese carbonara of sorts, with nutty asiago and rich pork."", 'Orkin tells me lunch will debut in July and that he eventually has plans to roll out some of the more expanded selections of noodles he offers in Tokyo — like a variety of tsukumen dipping ramen. There\'s no dessert here — Orkin says he\'s still ""tossing around"" that idea — and the lack of sweets of course helps him turn over tables more quickly. In the meantime, a friendly waiter recommends you saunter over to il Laboratorio del Gelato, where the wait, incidentally, might be longer than at Ivan Ramen; I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense in June to normal people, if not to food people.', 'Email Ryan at sutton@eater.com and follow him @qualityrye.']"

(One of them, James Mark, worked for David Chang.) Plates of country ham and fried oysters gussied with pickles share menu space with bowls of dan dan noodles and roasted chicken ramen. Inquire after the area's upscale favorite for anniversaries and the answer might be Persimmon in Bristol, a nearby seaside town. Its chef and co-owner, Champe Speidel, marries local tradition (elegant, fritter-like clam cakes poised over a lush clam chowder) with primo ingredients and modern notions (striped bass tartare, duck breast with foie gras-stuffed morels)."", ""But the first name in Providence restaurants remains the same one that first drew national attention over thirty years ago. Johanne Killeen and George Germon opened Al Forno in 1980. They'd met at the Rhode Island School of Design, where she studied photography and he focused on sculpture and architecture. Their mutual zeal for Italian cuisines led to running a place that initially only served during the day, the idea being that they could both concentrate on their art after the lunch rush. Customer enthusiasm quickly convinced the couple (who married in 1981) to switch to dinner, and cooking has been their main form of expression since."", 'The building in which the restaurant resides, once a stable near the city\'s waterfront, is the kind of space that artists would love—quirky and boxy, with plenty of nooks and long, narrow dining rooms on two floors. Predating the current debate in food circles by decades, Al Forno has long rejected the idea of reservations. Show up early or late or there will usually be a wait. A friend and I arrived around 6:10 on a recent Wednesday and hung out for only 10 minutes before a table was ready. We briefly ducked into the upstairs bar, snug and beckoning with its backlit shelves and marble tiles. I asked a staffer for a cocktail list. ""Nah, we don\'t have anything like that, we\'re a classic bar,"" he said. A Negroni then, please, sir.', 'Grilled pizza with kale pesto', ""Once we sat down to eat, the first order of business was obvious: Which grilled pizza should we order? This dish, more than anything, put the restaurant on the national radar. The story goes that Germon was talking with a fish supplier who'd recently come back from Italy and was raving about the grilled pizza he'd tried in Florence. It turned out that the guy was confusing a grill with a wood-burning oven, but the idea stayed with Germon. When he and Killeen experimented with dough cooked directly on the grilling grates, they were taken with the charred pockmarks left by the flames, and the texture that seesawed between crisp and chewy."", ""Al Forno's pizza deserves its pedestalled status. We chose one dotted with Tuscan kale pesto, which arrived in the shape of a flattened, stretched-out boomerang. Grill marks on the crackery crust were visible through a base of fontina and pecorino cheeses, topped with pools of tomato sauce, the roughly pureed pesto, and scallions strewn like confetti. If I lived in Providence I would eat it as often as possible, vacillating between this version, a simple margherita, and perhaps a variation zapped with chile oil. I would leave the one topped with fried onion rings for the college students eating here with their parents."", 'Bing cherry and almond tart', 'The restaurant also does something brilliant that other ambitious (non-tasting menu) restaurants should emulate: It asks diners to order desserts at the beginning of the meal, because the kitchen bakes cookies and tarts à la minute. I love this approach. It gives carefully prepared sweets their deserved respect. They become a thematic consideration rather than an afterthought. We anticipated our finale all through dinner, and were rewarded with a rustic bing cherry-almond crostata enriched with vanilla bean crème anglaise, and a bowl of dense, silky, freshly made caramel ice cream studded with candied nuts.', ""The beginning and the ending left the most memorable impressions, though the kitchen delivered other pleasures in between as well. Panko-crusted cod cakes came decorated with spoonfuls of smashed avocado for cool, smooth contrast, with slices of lemon tucked underneath to cut the fish's saltiness. Hot, freshly grilled croutons gave an otherwise textbook Caesar salad some pep to its personality. Clams were paired with hunks of spicy sausage, a combination with roots in the local Portuguese community. A blob of mashed potatoes, suffused with butter and heavy cream and with flecks of red skin visible, put the dish squarely in the realms of Americana comfort."", 'Cod cakes with smashed avocado; Clam roast with sausage and mashed potatoes']"

Baby kale leaves, wilted rapini, and pale green Romanesco broccoli (the conical tips surely an inspiration to Jean Paul Gaultier) are arranged into a careful jumble among farro, quinoa, and sprouted legumes. Ghostly blobs of burrata and hidden pockets of avocado smooth the many sharp flavors. A thin dehydrated chip made of vegetables, seeds, and nuts lends complex crunch. One of many attentive servers drizzles over freshly pressed olive oil that helps link all the elements. The eye doesn't know quite where to land, but the fork finds new, arresting combinations with every go-around."", ""And then there are the pastas—some smoked, some made with things like blood or mustard, some sauced with white chocolate. Bay Area residents may not want to hear this, but Matthew Accarrino reminds me of a Los Angeles chef. He was Tom Colicchio's opening chef de cuisine at Craft in L.A.; he had leadership positions at Rick Moonen's New York restaurant, RM, and Per Se prior to that. Like all plugged-in California cooks, he revels in the ingredients and growing season. (A garden in Napa Valley? Check.) His cooking, though, has a kinetic machismo that in particular brings to mind the busy-but-damn-that-works food from Jon Shook and Vinny Dotolo, who run the restaurants Animal and Son of a Gun in L.A. While Shook and Dotolo often draw on their roots in the American South, Accarrino looks to his Italian heritage."", 'He began taking SPQR in rambunctious new directions when he took over the kitchen in 2009. When the restaurant opened in 2007 it specialized in Roman dishes—hence the name, which is an abbreviation of Senatus Populusque Romanus, or ""The Senate and the Roman People."" Nate Appleman, chef at SPQR and its sister restaurant, A16, moved on two years later.', ""Accarrino's food doesn't dive deeply into any one region. And he's adopted the West Coast penchant of sprinkling in seasonings from around the globe. The French-Indian curry blend vadouvan adds sweet spice to a salad of carrots, lentils, and dates; ubiquitous Asian black garlic lurks among sea scallops. Most of the dishes have enough subtle or overt cues to keep the brain registering the meal as Italian. (And for those who've been to Rome, the congenial but cramped 50-seat space will evoke a snug trattoria.)"", '', 'Caramelized onion panna cotta with cured sturgeon and caviar; Suckling pig with turnips and dried persimmon', ""Do begin with something green—the brassicas or perhaps a chilled pea soup with a dollop of mint crema and smoked pepper—because dinner gets meaty and decadent fast. I can ingest alarming amounts of richness, but two of us couldn't finish a sweet onion panna cotta, even with lobes of cured sturgeon and caviar atop to cut the intensity. Imagine caramel ice cream gone savory and served as a first course. Try it when there's a group for sharing. Roasted, crackly-skinned suckling pork lulled in Parmesan consommé—a literal umami bath—was offset by pickled turnips and pleasantly astringent dried persimmon."", 'The menu\'s ""primi"" section, full of starchy marvels, is the reason that people who care about food should eat at SPQR. Accarrino\'s pastas unite imagination and execution exquisitely. The piquant edge to fine-textured mustard capellini enlivens a guinea hen ragout with savoy cabbage. (Atop the capellini he was shaving the last of his stash of Mimolette, the aged French cheese that the FDA has ludicrously banned from entering the U.S.). In a spate of Italian-American wit, he pairs Meyer lemon fettuccine with a creamy ""Alfredo"" sauce made from abalone. Additions of bottarga and garlic chips take it in red-blooded new directions. Ringlets of pasta made with blood, in a Tuscan blood sausage ragout was funky business. For a hit of offal, I much more strongly recommend the liver-strewn ""dirty rice"" crowned with sultry slices of Peking-style duck.', '', 'Meyer lemon fettuccine with abalone ""Alfredo"" sauce; Honey steamed cake with seasonal fruit', ""Go easy with dessert: buttermilk panna cotta (much lighter than its oniony counterpart) with strawberries and a chocolate mint ice that conjures childhood outings to Baskin-Robbins does the trick. Honestly, I could have skipped the sweets and had one more pasta—maybe the saffron lasagnette draped with a Bolognese variation using mushrooms. Accarrino has a mighty talent. I'll give it a year or two, but when news hits that he's decided to leave SPQR and start his own restaurant, I won't be surprised.""]"

The song hurls me back to my Dorito-munching, VH1-watching teenage self—a kid whose only contact with chicharrones was bagged pork rinds from Southern gas stations, and who couldn\'t possibly imagine a version being fashioned from a slimy marine creature. The relentlessly eighties playlist messes with my head the whole evening. My table sits ten feet from the gleaming stoves: I watch the cooks in one of San Francisco\'s most serious kitchens maintain their stony expressions even while Lionel Richie\'s ""All Night Long"" bounces overhead.', 'The bar at Saison', ""Despite the throwback music, Saison is the country's most modern iteration of an ultra-luxury restaurant. Executive chef and co-owner Joshua Skenes didn't spend years working his way through fine dining strongholds.

At the time Skenes was also serving lunchtime sandwiches, soups, and salads from food cart he called Carte415. For Saison, Skenes and Bright started out offering a multi-course meal for $60, with $30 optional wine pairings. Even then there were glimmers of what Saison would become: Guests were greeted with a glass of bubbly. The kitchen was open and relaxed enough then that diners could occasionally mosey through. Stunningly prepared seafood and vegetables, still Skenes's primary palette, anchored the menus."", ""The restaurant's evolution—and its owners' ambitions—went into warp speed. When word spread, reservations were often booked two months in advance. Skenes and Bright began serving three, four, and then five nights a week; within a year they leased the space and the pop-up became permanent. A hearth and a Molteni stove (essentially a cooktop Lamborghini) were installed. Last year the restaurant moved to an elegant 1800s building that once housed the California Electric Light Company in SoMa, near AT&T Park. Its industrial starkness received some initial chilly reception, but a recent remodel that included hardwood flooring for the kitchen and carpeting in the dining area helped warm the space and boost its local star rating."", 'At every step, Skenes\'s cooking intensified, the ingredients grew more rarified, and the prices escalated to match. Last year the restaurant offered a fixed-price menu for $298 per person in the 18-seat dining room, with a truncated $88 tasting menu in the bar. At the moment there is no bar menu, and in the dining room guests select from a $248 base option or the $398 ""discovery menu."" The optional wine pairing? Also $248, though the staff will also suggest several by-the-glass options to carry the meal. Of course there is also Bright\'s wine list, so massive now at 3,300 bottles that there are separate tomes for whites and reds.', ""I wanted to experience the full measure of the restaurant's powers, particularly to compare other tasting menus I tried on my trip to San Francisco, so I opted for the discovery prix fixe and the wine pairings. With one cocktail, tax, and tip, it was easily the most expensive meal of my life. I dined solo, and the bill came to $863.91."", 'Caviar with smoked sturgeon belly and gelee', ""The meal was also easily among the most remarkable of my life. After a tea of Meyer lemon and herbs, a hand towel, and a splash of Champagne, the first course arrived as an indulgent balm to banish the thoughts of money—a glass goblet filled with a liberal tablespoon of white sturgeon caviar. It came over cured, smoked sturgeon belly and a gelee made of the fish's grilled bones. The smoked and grilled elements perfumed each spoonful of caviar without overwhelming it, and the flavors summarized the primordial themes in Skene's cooking: ocean, fire, distillation."", ""Next came a riff on Provençal barigoule, artichoke with scallop in a gently astringent, palate-priming bouillon steeped from wild thistle. Then, a succession of one or two bite seafood dishes that danced the line between raw and cooked: a square of Japanese butterfish, one edge quickly pressed against coals; bonito basically waved over heat and served with a dot of black vinegar made from the fish's head; an angular piece of pickled horse mackerel on thin toast with crème fraiche. Two marvels followed: roasted abalone in a sauce of its liver and capers, topped with threads of laver seaweed, and then one perfect lobe of uni lolling over a piece of toast from unrivaled local bread company Tartine, the bottom soaked in vegetable juice."", ""How to define the food? You don't really. Like other brilliant, hell-bent American chefs of his generation, Skenes draws techniques from cooking traditions around the world and weaves them into a personal mosaic. With its nods to Asian and French cuisines boosted by those warm campfire overtones that our nation adores, I suppose the default label is Californian. Maybe we should just call it Skenesian."", ""Speaking of which, Skenes had just returned from his honeymoon in Japan and wasn't in the restaurant when I dined there. But his team, led that night by executive sous chef (and Eater Young Gun) Mitch Lienhard, executed the dishes with clinical precision. The cooks occasionally stepped away from their stations to deliver dishes to the tables themselves, an unusual breach of the fine-dining fourth wall that I appreciated, particularly considering that the kitchen is on full display like a stage set."", 'Grilled sea cucumber ""ribs""', 'As the meal progressed, the two-dozen dishes waxed and waned between the familiar and the curious. Smoked trout and an oyster swathed in Krug sabayon proceeded two sea cucumber dishes: Before the chicharron (made by drying the leathery skin and then frying it in oil until it puffed up), there were sea cucumber ""ribs""—interior muscles grilled and served in a frothy sauce of innards lightened with cured citrus peel.

The fish sat in a shallow pool of yogurt sauce tinged with coconut oil. In another creation, herbs and flowers from the restaurant\'s plot of land in Marin County cradled a gnarly hunk of celeriac ""crackling."" It looked like an ogre in the Garden of Eden. Six Parker House rolls sweetened with brown butter appeared; I scarfed down three and had to push the rest away.', ""Beverage pairings mirrored the food's Eastern-Western push-pull: There were four whites from France's Loire Valley among the wines but also sake and red rice ale from Japan with the early seafood preparations."", ""The homestretch: a savory cookie showered with foie gras snow and stuffed with minced livers, and wood pigeon scented with coffee beans paired with paper-thin circles of pear dusted with red peppercorns and nutmeg.

Forage itself is situated on a stretch of East 900 South that could pass for a residential block in any quiet suburb of Long Island or Northern Virginia — I almost walked by the restaurant because I mistook it as someone's home."", 'Beet with toasted grains; Elk with roots and charred kale', ""Sit down and true to form for any modern no-choice joint, the food starts coming. First, there's that gin-free tonic, then a succession of one or two-bite amuses: a buckwheat cake with a quail egg (meh), a fermented yellow bean meant for dipping in egg emulsion (my type of crudites), grain-coated baby beets (the cruel veal of the vegetable world), and finally, a slice of trout smoked over pinion wood, topped with apple vinegar gel and finished with a sweet cicely leaf. There's your Utah sashimi — sweet, oily and fruity."", 'Then come the proper courses. Raw lamb, aged five weeks, is balanced by the tartness of fermented carrots. Fresh cheese, surrounded by foamy whey, is topped with forsythia flowers that start sweet and finish bitter. Where do the flowers come from? ""A very kind neighbor six houses down,"" says Bowman. Cool. He grills sturgeon with leeks and follows that up with a clear consommé of the fish\'s bones in a cedar bowl; the broth tastes of clean wood and ocean.', ""But best of all are the Spanish sweet onions, stuffed with heady chicken sausage, glazed in a sticky onion reduction, cooked over hot coals (the bitter char tempers the sweetness) and paired with pickled onions. The meat seasons a three-way degustation of onions rather than the other way around, a brilliant dish that wouldn't be out of place at David Kinch's Manresa or Joshua Skenes' Saison."", ""Sorrel, nature's best lime impersonator, helps wind down the meal, in the form of an airy meringue and a bright sorbet. Sugar-baked rhubarb is paired with onions to bring out its vegetal side, and then topped with sour buttermilk sorbet to remind you this is still dessert. Soft acorn cake is soaked in warm acorn milk, taking on a gorgeously musky quality that I can only describe as the dairy equivalent of aged meat. And there's your meal."", ""So say what you will about the inevitable march of the long tasting (which I've generally been a supporter of). Forage is the type of restaurant our country needs more of, challenging the diner, charging a fair price (perhaps too fair), leaving you sated (but not stuffed), and eliminating choice to allow the chef to focus on serving the best products, instead of kowtowing to the whims of the customer. This Bud's for you, Bowman Brown.""]"
377,"[""In the mid-90s, the Jersey City neighborhood that came to be known as Little India was in its formative stages. A two-block stretch of Newark Avenue that descended steeply toward the Meadowlands swamps hosted a small collection of groceries, jewelry stores, paan parlors, and sweets shops anchored by Singh's, a teetering clapboard variety store in whose fantastically cluttered aisles Garbage Pail Kids cavorted with Hindu deities. Best of four restaurants was Chowpatty, named after a popular beach in Mumbai. Indeed, the menu was heavy with the beach snacks called chaats – flavorful heaps of fried noodles and vegetable fritters splatted with yogurt and chutneys."", ""But perhaps more important, the menu specialized in the food of Gujarat, a partly rural, partly industrial state on the west-central edge of the country bordering Pakistan, a figurative stone's throw from Mumbai. The food was a revelation. We learned, for example, that Gujaratis relish cornbread, yams, black-eyed peas, and greens just like American Southerners; but they also consume more exotic vegetables such as tindora – a pinky size cucumber – and ridged gourds called tori. Like many of the new Gujarati immigrants, the restaurant Chowpatty was vegetarian, and it catered to a religious group known as the Jains, whose concern for living things was so complete, they eschewed garlic and onions so as not to harm the insects that infested the underground bulbs of those plants."", '', 'Kachori chaat', ""Chowpatty has been shuttered for 15 years, and the Gujaratis who once thronged Little India on weekends have largely dispersed in favor of a South Indian crowd who prefer the cuisines of Hyderabad and Chennai. But thankfully, the fascinating Gujarati menu persists in Manhattan's Curry Hill in slightly upscale form at Bhojan. As with the Jersey City restaurants of yore, its strictly vegetarian bill of fare also includes Mughal dishes from northern India, so you can enjoy familiar classics such as saag paneer, daal makhni, and navratan korma. More about those later."", 'Foremost among a new generation of restaurants on Lower Lex showcasing regional Indian cuisines, Bhojan mounts a bar in front with a full liquor license, leading to a passageway that skirts jazzy modern bathroom facilities.

The rear dining room is all brick and mirrors; it might be an Irish pub, except for a couple of quirky design elements, including a ceiling array of karahis (cooking vessels like copper woks) and glass bottles incorporated into medieval-looking chandeliers.', 'Undhyu', 'Though the restaurant is Hindu-identified (Swami Sivananda is linked on the website), the menu offers to prepare dishes following Jainist dietary strictures, which means spices like asafetida, a tree resin, can be substituted for onions and garlic. Just like old times in Jersey City!', ""First, the uniquely Gujarati stuff. Simplest and perhaps most arresting is Gujarati kadhi ($8), warm yogurt blended with chickpea flour to perfect dribbling consistency, so that a small bowl will soak a good-size plate of rice. This mellow treat is typical of the everyday Indian fare rarely glimpsed in New York restaurants, and the waiter is likely to warn you away, thinking you'll be put off by its plainness. Persevere! A Punjabi version of the same dish, amplified with tidbits of fried dough and flavored with Asian cumin, expands on the theme."", 'More immediately satisfying is pumpkin sabji ($13), a bright orange stir-fry of squash chunks prettily dotted with black mustard seeds and glistening with an almost-gooey sauce. Another worthy selection is a puree of spinach and mustard greens that sounds like a designer label: Sarson da saag arrives heaped with matchsticks of raw ginger, as deeply green as the Meadowlands in early summertime. Strangest of the Gujarati standards are globe-shaped fritters of fresh fenugreek (methi gota, $6), an herb with a loamy flavor hard to describe, also used extensively in Egyptian cooking. (Disclaimer: on one occasion when we ordered methi gota, they were too dry.)', 'Kandhvi; Dhokla; Moolo paratha', 'Two starters flaunt the starchy side of the cuisine: kandhvi are rolled chickpea noodles that will remind you of dim sum, while dhokla are airy cakes of chickpea flour that might be mistaken for cornbread made with white cornmeal. Hello, Mississippi!The renditions of Mughal food modified for Gujarati sensibilities are lush ones, and it\'s well worth ordering the mixed-vegetable, nut-sauced navratan kurma (""nine-gem curry,"" $13) just to see how it differs from the usual steam-table product. Ma kii bindi is a homestyle okra dish that leaves the pods nearly intact, bobbing in a tomato sauce that might have been made by an Italian cook who mistakenly substituted cumin for rosemary. Interested in fiery? The vegetable vindaloo is hot as hell and distractingly sweet at the same time. Yes, Gujarati chefs can be sugar freaks.', '""Don\'t neglect the chaats, which have the capacity to transport you to exotic beaches on the other side of the world.""', ""Don't neglect the chaats, which have the capacity to transport you to exotic beaches on the other side of the world. Kachori chaat ($8) describes a crunchy crater of dough erupting with yogurt and tamarind sauce. Scattered around the rim like lava rocks find freshly sprouted mung beans. Don't be deterred from ordering it because the snack seems too healthy; it tastes great. By contrast, dabeli is a working-class mashed potato sandwich on a sesame-seed bun of substantial girth. If McDonald's had originated in Mumbai, the Quarter Pounder would look like this."", '', 'Sarson da saag', 'There\'s much to love in all parts of Bhojan\'s nine-section menu, one of which is unexpectedly devoted to multiple takes on chai tea. The masala chai is fine, but even better is gud (pronounced ""good"") chai ($3), augmented with jaggery (raw brown sugar) and scented with cardamom. The polar alternative, beverage-wise, would be the restaurant\'s cocktail program, which averages $9 per drink. That\'s a couple of dollars below par on the modern cocktail circuit, and these drinks are way strong. However, the one I tried was so horrendous my stomach still churns when I think of it: the kamasutra (wink, wink), colored a carnal shade of red, incorporates something like Hawaiian punch shaken with an unholy trinity of vodka, gin, and rum.

Two of us avoided the dinner commotion by sliding in for a late lunch with no wait."", 'Stone crab claws and fried chicken', ""Of course we ordered the main attraction, which was offered in four sizes; we went for the large specimens weighing in at $59.95 per pound, which bought us five claws. Their shells were cream-colored at the base. But like a blush that spreads over the face from the neck up, the hue grew pink toward the center and darkened to salmon-roe orange near the tip of the black pincers. The kitchen had cracked them, so it was easy to pick out the meat—dense and sweet, the bridge between feathery blue crab meat and springier lobster. One of the claws wasn't quite fractured enough, so the server wrapped it in a napkin and whacked it with a mallet a couple of times. That did the trick."", '(A note about stone crabs: Their armor is so thick that, unlike more malleable blue or Dungeness crabs, only their claws are prized as delicacies. Stone crabbers collect the critters and then carefully break off one or two claws—one is more humane, leaving the crab with the ability to defend itself—and then they toss the crabs back in the water. Their claws eventually regenerate.)', 'Lump crab Niçoise', 'We sought out a few other dishes along with the stone crab claws, starting with a lumpen crab Niçoise, packed into a large glass, shaken into a bowl for a bit of showmanship, and served with creamy herb dressing on the side. A couple king crab legs, spiky and lithe, yielded strands of delicate flesh with a slightly more oceanic flavor than the stone crab. Small sides of creamed spinach and griddled hash browns delivered chophouse satisfaction.', 'A fun menu quirk: Half of a fried chicken goes for $5.95, a tradition with the Weiss family (the original founders whose offspring still run the restaurant) to offer an affordable dish. In the pantheon of fried chicken it was fine, with cornmeal in the crust for extra crunch but overall possessing a fast-food ubiquity. Picky kids would likely enjoy it. Grownups who can afford the indulgence should stick with the seafood.', ""After next week, Joe's shifts into off-season mode: It closes for lunch, shuts down its take-out operation, and serves dinner Wednesday through Sunday. The kitchen prepares other seasonal seafood dishes: soft-shell crabs, Copper River salmon. The restaurant will serve one size of stone crab claws, but they come from the deep freeze. Keep in mind this all applies only to the Miami location: Outposts in Chicago, Las Vegas, and Washington D.C. are run in partnership with the Windy City's Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises.

In the way that Pok Pok's Andy Ricker and others—like Kris Yenbamroong at his Night + Market restaurants in Los Angeles—are moving our notions of Thai food beyond pastel curries and spring rolls, we need some front-and-center restaurants that revel in Indian cooking's feral edges. We taste such an insignificant sliver of the subcontinent's vast cuisines in this country. Most menus cleave to the dairy-rich dishes refined by the Persian-influenced Mughal Empire, which ruled India from its northern roost for four centuries. It takes hunting, usually through an Indian neighborhood in a major city, to find the humble places that serve Kerala dried shrimp curry in coconut gravy, or fish cooked with heady mustard oil from Calcutta, or the Mumbai version of the street snack pani puri—fried shells filled with cubed potatoes and black chickpeas and doused with a green liquid hinting of sulfur from kala namak, or black salt."", ""While I wait for the revolution, I am glad for the few higher end restaurants that employ the tastes of India shrewdly, blending them with Western ingredients and techniques while keeping the motherland's essence intact. Lauded Washington D.C. restaurateur Ashok Bajaj runs three of them: The Bombay Club and two locations of Rasika. (He also operates five other restaurants that serve a gamut of cuisines, including Italian and Modern American.) The Bombay Club, situated a block from the White House, opened in 1988 and has long been a haven for the city's power players. It emulates the gentlemen's clubs of India's past. Rasika, which first launched in 2005, feels very much of its own era."", '', 'Samosas', 'The room\'s handsome wood trim and the potted palms nestling beige columns evoke both a British Raj stage set and the decor favored around the time of the Iran-Contra affair. A $600,000 remodel in 2009 ushered in a private dining space and swirly mauve carpet, just to freshen the restrained elegance. Tuxedoed service is unobtrusive: There are deferential nods and swift but efficient visits to the table. No one prattles about giving a ""tour"" of the menu. Someone plays a white baby grand near the entrance while slow ceiling fans stir the air overhead.', 'In other words, The Bombay Club is an Indian iteration of the Continental restaurants of yore, and after 25 years in business it retains a dressy, diverse clientele. A few menu items detour into modern conceits: One of the breads is stuffed with goat cheese, and kale, the green that conquered the nation, appears flash-fried as a snack lashed with chutneys and yogurt. But most are plucked straight from the Indian lexicon—cherry-picked dishes that represent either the gentlest creations from around the country, or highlighting those whose spices are easiest to dial back.', '', 'Sev puri', ""So rather than the assertive nip of pani puri, there is sev puri, wheat puffs filled with bits of potato and mango, drizzled with tamarind and cilantro chutneys and yogurt and sprinkled with crisp, ultra-thin noodles made from chickpea flour. Pop, pop. They go down as easy as a handful of Chex Mix at a Christmas open house. Nilesh Singhvi—who previously oversaw the kitchens at the Taj Palace hotel in New Delhi—composes a delicate version of masala crab from the Southwestern coasts. It's barely scented with curry leaf and worlds tamer than the crab dishes that Marylanders prefer spiked by Old Bay seasoning. The lumpy morsels taste fresh and sweet, though. Shrimp lolling in coconut cream gravy dotted with mustard seeds is equally docile."", 'Sali Boti; Club thali', ""For something a tad feistier, try sali boti, a lamb specialty of Mumbai's Parsi (Persian-descended) community simmered with tomatoes, yogurt, ginger, garlic, red wine vinegar, and apricots, finished with potato sticks. The kitchen composes a striking thali on a silver platter, arrayed with lemon rice or another pilaf, a couple ruddy meat curries, dal, and a vegetable like the ubiquitous creamed spinach (saag)."", 'And for liquid dessert, four of us retreated to the lounge, where one of the suited hosts rolled out a cart to prepare cobra coffees made famous at the Bombay Brasserie in London, where Bajaj once worked. He peeled off a trailing curl of orange rind (the ""cobra"") and lit it on fire with flaming booze before mixing it with coffee and pouring the drink into glasses with caramel-coated rims.

Rasika clearly gets more attention.', '', ""The Bombay Club's maître d' isn't quite accurate, either. Rasikas' menus do tackle more cross-cultural riffs than their older sibling: chaat salads made with avocado, samosas stuffed with sweet potato, griddled eggplant slicked with olive oil (a burgeoning product in India, but still), fritters formed with, yes, kale. But their offerings are also broader, and many of the dishes, particularly entrees, similarly derive from among the swath of Indian cuisines. The main difference is that the food as Rasika is bolder, the flavors punchier and less rounded."", ""That holds true for the atmosphere as well. The scheme at the second Rasika in West End, which opened in 2012, is downright conceptual: Rectangular wood panels climb up a column into the shape of a modernist Bodhi tree, and a silvery hand reaches over a glass partition, sculpted into the shape of a Buddhist mudra. The Penn Quarter original looks sedate by comparison, though its ruby, gold, and burnt orange tones still feel like you're wrapped in an especially opulent sari."", 'Mango shrimp; Pepper crab', ""I've visited both outposts in the last couple years and found them superb and on par with one another; the precision of the cooking at Penn Quarter slightly outpaces its younger brother. I lunched at the original recently, though I urge first timers to go for dinner, when the meal feels more like an occasion. (The menus are identical.) We started with uttapam, a pancake made from fermented rice and lentil batter, studded with seasonally appropriate white asparagus. The mustard seeds and curry leaves seasoned overtly, and the dollop of coconut chutney on top took the dish home to South India. Crab revved with plenty of ginger and garlic came stacked with peppered phyllo dough that visually imitated poori, the breads that balloon while frying. A swift char on shrimp glossed with mango created a smoky sweetness. Mixed grill—salmon roasted in the tandoor oven, chicken scented with green cardamom, a smooth-textured lamb kebab sprightly with garam marsala—proved a satisfying mélange of proteins. The only miss was a strange variation of poriyal, a coconut-flecked vegetable saute from the Southern state of Tamil Nadu, this one starring broccoli. The ingredients needed to better merge. It tasted like a bowl of prepped ingredients waiting to be cooked. Thankfully, Rasika's date and toffee pudding always banishes any minor disappointments."", ""Bajaj is D.C.'s savviest restaurateur. Perhaps he's noticed the lines trailing out the door of Little Serow, the restaurant by Johnny Monis that serves family-style dinners of intense northern Thai cuisine. The palates of the city, and the nation, seem primed for a similar new venture that unleashes the funkier side of Indian cuisine. Bajaj has broken ground before; maybe he can do it again.""]"

She began the restaurant modestly in 1971, serving French food inspired by cookbook authors like Richard Olney and Elizabeth David. Her search for quality ingredients from nearby farmers eventually propelled the California cuisine movement—as did the skills of other freethinking cooks who joined her in the kitchen through the years. In turn they helped foster pride in homegrown foods and traditions among chefs in the country\'s other regions. The Chez Panisse philosophy rerouted America\'s culinary trajectory. Its continuing insistence on simplicity also generates its share of backlash.', 'This has all been written about and discussed ad nauseum. How satisfying is Chez Panisse for diners circa right now?

""This looks like something you\'d serve at home,"" he says.', '""It\'s designed that way,"" I respond. We\'re gazing at our most substantial of five courses: fetching, misshapen hunks of wild King salmon grilled and topped with a sauce of chopped mushrooms. On the side are leeks braised in red wine, a little tuft of salad greens, and several stalks of asparagus. Of course every element on the plate exudes freshness. The mushrooms are morels, dark as olives and forest-deep in their earthiness. Their flavor melds with the salmon\'s gentle, fishy musk.

As it has always been, the dining room feels like an intimate supper club. All signs of the fire that closed the restaurant for three months last year have vanished. The reclaimed redwood paneling gleams ruddy and handsome; the geometric copper light fixtures cast flattering shadows. We had a 6 p.m. reservation and the evening started leisurely. Our bright, engaging server brought out thick slices of sourdough from Acme Bread Company (started by Steven Sullivan, a Chez Panisse alum) and a plate of bacalao crostini with a few olives.', ""The room filled and dinner didn't begin in earnest until around 6:45 p.m., with a fan of yellowtail jack crudo dribbled with olive oil and dappled with crushed grapefruit, garlic, and herbs. Clean flavors, easy to enjoy. Next came risi e bisi—rice and peas—with ringlets of grilled Monterey Bay squid. The restaurant may have started French, but Paul Bertolli, the main chef from 1982 to 1992, shifted the style of cooking toward Italy, a direction the savory kitchen in particular maintains.

Peternell was in the kitchen during my meal.)"", 'Strawberry and rhubharb millefoglie', ""The salmon followed the rice and peas, and then came a strawberry and rhubarb millefoglie—an endearingly lopsided pastry shell filled with cream and decorated with slices of candied kumquat.

We thanked our hosts, muttered kind words about the food on the way out the door, and felt relaxed on the drive home. Just like eating at an old friend's house."", 'Chicken ""al mattone"" with stone ground polenta; Poached halibut with coconut-coriander chutney', ""I felt worlds more excited about the pizzetta sitting in front of me the following week. Taking cues from the Connecticut school of pizza, fresh clams dotted the pie, which had also been sprinkled liberally with punchy marjoram. The cheese and tomato sauce fused, the charred crust crackled, and the clam's briny jolt infused every bite. It was the beginning of a spectacular lunch."", ""The Cafe at Chez Panisse opened upstairs in 1980 for diners seeking a more casual option, and over the years it has developed its own personality—the spunkier younger sister who's frankly more fun to be around. The à la carte menu has grown in length through the decades, and the items can change even from noon to night, but expect gutsier, more soulful compositions than what's served downstairs. Out of sentimentality I ordered the baked goat cheese covered in bread crumbs and herbs, nestled among garden lettuces, a dish that's been available since the cafe's earliest days. It made the Indian nuances of poached halibut shocking by comparison: The fish came with saffron rice, gingered spinach, rounds of golden beets, and a dollop of coconut-coriander chutney. It was the culinary equivalent of Joni Mitchell suddenly taking up the sitar."", 'Apricot galette with vanilla ice cream', 'All-American pleasures followed: Crisp-edged chicken cooked under a brick and flecked with rosemary, with polenta prepared creamy enough that we might as well call them grits. Shaved leg of lamb revved with a mustard sauce, the seeds popping between my teeth. And my god, the desserts. The apricot galette looked so simple but contained the universe—a dance of sweet and tart, the crust carrying a whiff of smoke from the wood oven, the vanilla ice cream alongside enhancing without distracting.', ""I lingered over two other sweets—strawberry-rhubarb shortcake and a honey-yogurt sherbet with roasted blueberries—nearly as transcendent. The service was lovable, not as confident as the downstairs team but intent on our happiness. We were seated in a small room at the top of the restaurant's converted Craftsman house, a turret of sorts with old-timey wallpaper of tree-like patterns. Out the window, I could see the lush spring and a cloudless blue sky, and a sliver of San Francisco Bay and the mountains beyond. Yes, I thought. This is the Chez Panisse experience that best encapsulates California cooking.""]"

""Cornet of salmon tartare with sweet red onion crème fraîche,"" he says. Fifteen years ago, when I first relished this savory replica of the all-American ice cream cone, the staff brought the snack with a demeanor that announced, ""We\'re turning fine dining on its head."" Now it arrives almost as a nostalgic gesture, an opener that says, ""This is where the revolution began—and isn\'t it still delicious?""', 'The French Laundry turns 20 next month. Or rather, its incarnation with luminary chef Thomas Keller as its owner does. The 1890 stone building, nestled among vineyards in a small Napa Valley town, began its life as a restaurant under the same name by a couple, Don and Sally Schmitt, in 1977. Keller had trained in restaurants in France and New York and ran a restaurant in Manhattan called Rakel that ultimately failed in 1990. The Schmitts served meals in a Chez Panisse-like format, with one set menu that changed nightly. When Keller took over in 1994, he offered a four- or five-course dinner with options in every category. Soon, he would begin concentrating on tasting menus that included a flurry of whimsical small bites to start the evening.', '', '""Coffee and doughnuts""', 'In his years between running restaurants, Keller percolated on ideas that would eventually reset the nature of upscale American cooking. At The French Laundry, he melded European technique with dishes that were embedded in our national consciousness. His take on ""coffee and doughnuts""—cappuccino semifreddo with hot cinnamon-and-sugar-coated orbs—was an early hit and gave him confidence to keep the pushing the boundaries of wit: ""Surf and turf"" with monkfish tail and braised oxtails, ""Caesar salad"" with Parmigiano-Reggiano custards, ""Banana split"" with poached banana ice cream and crepes. Due to Keller\'s precision, these creations never came off as gimmicky. His approach forged new contextual territory in the food culture, and gave French cuisine—always the basis of his cooking—a place of honor at a time when ""New American"" was the mantra in restaurants.', ""So much has been said over the years about The French Laundry and the empire it spawned. (Keller hasn't manned the stoves at the Laundry since 2005; chef de cuisine David Breeden oversees the kitchen day-to-day.) I came to a recent meal intrigued to see how the experience fit in among the newer generation of tasting-menu restaurants. Many of them are run by Keller disciples, including Grant Achatz of Alinea and Next in Chicago, Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco, and Rene Redzepi of Noma in Copenhagen. The relative newcomers take wilder leaps of imagination and exotica than the Yountville standard-bearer, which can seem downright traditional by comparison."", 'And by no means am I using ""traditional"" as a euphemism for ""boring."" A person can\'t feel ennui amid such a whirl of attentiveness, a style of intelligent, unusually personable service perfected by former general manager Laura Cunningham. That rare feeling—of being pampered by knowing guides who establish a specially tailored rhythm and mood—is part of what makes the meal worth the price.', 'Oysters and pearls; Mackerel with Meyer lemon and piquillo pepper', 'My friend and I came for lunch, which to me is the power move at The French Laundry: The food engages the palate and the brain, and it seems more enjoyable to absorb it all midday. We started off with gougères and then the salmon cornet—France and America each in single mouthfuls. The courses seesawed between richer and lighter, sharper dishes. Pleasantly astringent avocado and buttermilk soup came before Keller\'s signature ""oysters and pearls,"" a sabayon of pearl tapioca with two tiny oysters and a quenelle of white sturgeon caviar that resembled a giant mulberry. To cut the decadence: a square of translucent mackerel, its fishiness assuaged by Meyer lemon and frisky piquillo pepper. A plate of intricately arranged peas and carrots—dewy in their springtime glory, with poached rhubarb and minced hearts of peach palm—acted as a palate cleanser before fried soft-shell crab crowned and asparagus surrounded by onion velouté enriched with crème fraîche.', '', 'Mac and cheese', ""Part of Keller's intent has been to serve food that evokes emotion, and the highlight that left us exhilarated was one of the restaurant's riffs on macaroni and cheese. The original came with butter-poached Maine lobster, but as restaurants across America glommed onto the idea, Keller and his crew came up with new versions: This one brought together handmade tube pasta, sweetbreads, and a binding sauce fashioned from fava beans. Out came the humidor box, and one of the staffers giddily buried the dish in black truffle shavings. (I should add that the dish comes with a $100 supplement charge atop the meal's $295 base price, but for such dizzying luxury I'd say go for it.)"", 'Herb-roasted veal; ""Pawlet"" cheese course; Sour cherry mousse', 'A veal dish wrapped in leaves and mousse made of cabbage, with a pierogi filled with a ragout of corned veal heart (scrumptious), was followed by a small, charming cheese course: Pawlet, a nutty cow\'s milk variety from Vermont, was cut in a thin, fluted circle to match a fennel pollen shortbread cookie. Finally, the desserts arrived: sour cherry mousse, then yogurt sherbet with a brown sugar-maple tart, and then a layered chocolate torte flavored with Virginia peanut and caramel made from Banyuls vinegar. And just when we thought we were done, the server arrived with one last treat: ""We couldn\'t let you leave without our \'coffee and doughnuts,\'"" he said. Honestly, we were spent—and the dish has been imitated so often over the last two decades, it had lost its novelty. We ate it more out of politeness than excitement.', ""I left thinking about meals I'd had at Benu and Saison on the same Bay Area trip. At those next-gen tasting menu restaurants, unexpected ingredients and jolts—a chicharron made from sea cucumber, a kimchi dumpling that shattered in the mouth—made meals as much about novelty as pleasure. The French Laundry is more about experiencing the familiar in elevated ways. I respect both approaches. Which do I recommend more? If you're young and want to understand the groundwork of modern fine dining, head to Yountville. If you've dined before at Keller's paean to perfectionism and have an open mind, try Benu or Saison."", ""But even the jaded should keep an eye on The French Laundry. Keller recently announced that he's renovating the restaurant, which will include a new 2,000-square-foot kitchen. The restaurant certainly isn't hurting for reservations, but Keller wants to stay big-picture relevant. I can't imagine the salmon cornet or the coffee and doughnuts will disappear altogether, but I'm guessing we might soon witness new levels of creativity at his flagship."", '[Photos: Bill Addison]']"

That's how long a friend and I waited for a server to greet us at Gramercy Tavern on a Sunday night earlier this month. We sank into our chairs in the handsome back room and then watched the staff circle around nearby tables. We began exchanging puzzled glances when no one paused long enough to say hello. Our waiter arrived at last, a glimmer of fluster under his outward composure, and he didn't apologize. He only asked us what we'd like to drink and launched straight into the menu options.

Well, this is the beloved institution that established a new order of hospitality in American restaurants. Twenty years ago this July, Meyer and then chef-partner Tom Colicchio implemented a style of service that Meyer had been perfecting at his first venture, Union Square Cafe. The approach was polished yet unusually warm, closing the gap between upscale and casual dining. I know this philosophy endures in practice as well as in theory (for which Meyer is famous): The table next to us had a different server, and we noticed with envy that those guests basked in the fellow's wholehearted attention. "", 'Beef tartare', ""Colicchio formally left the restaurant in 2006 to devote himself to his own restaurant Craft and Top Chef stardom. Michael Anthony, who had cooked at the Blue Hill restaurants in Manhattan and Westchester County, took over the kitchens shortly thereafter. Nearly eight years into his run, Anthony and his team put out satisfying, approachable plates that match the cozy-swank ambience. Under the elegant wooden beams and butterscotch light, the legions sigh over dishes like beef tartare, its flavors strong and reassuring, punctuated by pine nuts, pickled mushrooms, capers, and chives. The menu doesn't intend to surprise; it aims to comfort with familiarity and impress with sterling ingredients. "", 'Steak with chickpea fries; Tagliatelle with pork Bolognese', 'Meats higher on the food chain made a particularly strong showing at our dinner. A special of sliced New York strip came nestled in the lap of springtime. The beef was splayed over a bright, masterfully sharp puree that included angelica, green chickpeas, ramps, and spinach. The creamiest chickpea fries stood in for potatoes. And I loved the way Anthony used pork in ways usually associated for beef. A piggy Bolognese tossed with tagliatelle had an appealing unctuousness and meaty bite, and he included the little-seen pork spinalis muscle (sometimes known as the rib cap or deckle in beef) with roasted loin for added richness and textural variation. ', 'Our server did deliver when we asked if we could order an extra course borrowed from the seasonal tasting menu—a gentle lobster salad arranged in an artful jumble of shaved asparagus and pickled ramps. ', 'Lobster salad with asparagus', ""I lived in New York in the mid-1990s and worked in restaurants, and Gramercy Tavern's opening pastry chef Claudia Fleming was one of my heroes. Her desserts were singular balancing acts between homey and sophisticated, savory and sweet. I miss them. The gorgeous-to-behold creations by current pastry chef Miroslav Uskokovic, a veteran of Jean Georges, were more fiddly than I've had before at the restaurant: A half-moon of torn angel food cake pieces and other busy bits covered a coconut custard, and a slice of almond cake with rhubarb could have used less saucy swipes and edible flowers and more buttery depth. But that may just be my sentimentality. Next time I'll grab a bar stool in the more casual front room and order the apple crisp, a holdover from Fleming's days (though undoubtedly tweaked), and vanish into my memories. ""]"

The metallic sting of the shellfish, the porky wallop of the broth, and the punch of the peppers are perfectly balanced — albeit at nuclear warfare levels of balance. So relief is crucial. The limeade lasts me a good five minutes, while the caffeinated Thai iced tea is gone in one. And I won't fall asleep until four in the morning."", ""Our party is silent.

Then there's the waiter. He comes over and tells us that Pok Pok NY — the larger sister spot next door — is ready for us. Yep, this is only the beginning, because you just spent your 60-minute wait for a dinner table by having a separate, smaller dinner, at an actual table, watching sports. This is what I call ideal."", '', ""It's a good time to be spending time on South Brooklyn's Waterfront because Pok Pok, chef and restaurateur Andy Ricker's newly-relocated Thai restaurant, is hitting its stride in a serious way two years after opening. Remember how ugly things got that first summer of business? Lines to get in stretched down the block. Sometimes cocktails wouldn't come until after your food arrived. And service was once so bad I had to raid the service station myself for napkins and utensils. But that was then."", 'Ricker opened Soda Lounge to help make the wait more bearable. Then he found a new space for Pok Pok with more indoor seating and a larger kitchen; it opened in November. He kicked off all-day service on the weekends to help get rid of those crazy lines. He made the entire menu available via takeout (fish sauce wings + Game of Thrones = SCORE).  And he a launched breakfast with damn good Chinese pork buns; you can be in and out in 10 minutes flat and spend less than $15 after tea, tax, and tip. That is cool.', '""The era of the three hour wait is over,"" the restaurant\'s director of operations, Matthew Adams, tells me. That is very cool.', ' Pok Pok is a prime example of how good restaurants often need a year or two to get their act together.', 'The story is simple: Pok Pok is proof that a high-profile (yet bare bones) neighborhood restaurant can turn itself into a real destination with a little practice, a few extra creature comforts, and a bit of that precious commodity known as time (and perhaps money). Or put more succinctly: Pok Pok is a prime example of how good restaurants often need a year or two to get their act together. So sometimes we critics give them a re-review. This is one of those times.', 'Not that anyone ever expected anything less from Ricker. The dude, a Vermont native, made a name for himself at his flagship Pok Pok in Portland, Oregon, serving his take on the fragrant food of Northern and Northeastern Thailand. ""I\'m not a chef. I didn\'t invent this stuff…I\'m a proud copycat,"" he writes in his cookbook, which you should read cover-to-cover before you eat at his restaurant, just as if you studied The French Laundry Cookbook before you dropped $700 at Per Se back in 2004. As Australian chef David Thompson writes, ""Andy has almost singlehandedly created a market for regional Thai cuisine in the United States.""', 'In other words, Ricker eschews the American-friendly rainbow curries of Thailand\'s South and relegates his pad Thai noodles to a separate outpost in Manhattan. It all seems ballsy enough until you realize that Pok Pok highlights the deliciously accessible smorgasbord of meat salads that one might find in Chiang Mai or Isaan province. In fact if I were Ricker, and you should thank The Good Gods of Gastronomy that I\'m not, I would\'ve named the joint ""Meat Salad"" and cashed in with the carnivorous Thai equivalent of Chop\'t or Sweetgreen.', '', 'Fortunately, Ricker went with Pok Pok, an onomatopoeic nod to the sound a mortar and pestle makes as it tenderizes green papaya for its som tam lao. ""Looks like coleslaw,"" says my father. Tastes a bit different. Chefs pound the fruit just enough to let it absorb the right amount of key lime, sugar, chile, and fish sauce. It\'s all balanced enough until you ask for the version with salted black crab, which makes the dish taste as if it were seasoned with the remnants of seagull-pocked crustaceans that had been drying up on Rockaway beach for the last three weeks. That means it\'s funky. I dig it.', 'Smart guests will start with that treat as well as with the hand minced swine salad, an addictive mix of ground pork, cracklings, fried garlic, mountain cilantro, and just enough long pepper to make your brow sweat. I watched in awe as a friend who recently got back from Southeast Asia consumed this the traditional way, using pockets of sticky rice to snatch up the meaty morsels with her hands, the cheaper starch acting as an edible implement to extend the flavor of the more expensive pork. I on the other hand used a spoon to shovel the protein-heavy bounty into my mouth as if I were participating in a competitive eating contest.', '', ""I apologize. It was that good. The laap, as it's called, could go head-to-head with any of its analogues at Zabb Elee or Somtum Der in Manhattan and come out on top — and of course it doesn't hurt that the drinks are better here at Pok Pok. Suggested beverage pairing: A tall-ass gin & tonic infused with enough Kaffir to qualify as incense."", 'Another suggested pairing for the pork salad: The pile of herbs and vegetables they come with — which waiters can name and describe with remarkable accuracy. There are too many to list here, but hone in on the Thai eggplant (whose soft seeds are like vegetarian caviar), bai makhok (like sorrell but with twice the sourness), and rau ram (imagine lawnmower juice cut with wasabi).', ""Just as tasty is the sweeter Isan flank steak salad, with toasted rice powder, lemongrass, and a boatload of mint. No, there's not a whole lot of beefy flavor and that's okay; many of these dishes don't show off the proteins in the same way as you might expect at, say, Craft or Minetta Tavern, where the quail or the steak is the star of the plate. At Pok Pok, the meat rather acts as a savory delivery mechanism for all the firecracker-like herbs, spices, and sauces."", '', ""Take the whole poussin, a relative steal at $21. Don't expect the concentrated flavor of poultry, but rather a neutral, tofu-like creaminess to show off the aromas of the lemongrass stuffing.

It's not until you chew a few times and suck out all the juices when you detect that subtle musk of the boar coming through."", '', 'The ambience is lean — as it should be. Expect Thai ballads on the sound system, plastic covers on the tables, and charcoal-tinged aromas in the air. Pay attention to servers, as the good ones will tell you to balance out the spicier fare with milder dishes — like the lemongrass sausage, a superb deep-fried porgy, firewater spinach with pork, or fiddlehead ferns in oyster sauce.', 'Misses are rare. Beware the khao soi, a mild curry soup that tastes like someone dumped a can of wheat noodles in unflavored coconut milk. Avoid the catfish cha ca la vong, a study in soft textures and bland flavors. And sometimes getting a beer can still be a five to 10 minute hassle.', '', ""Expect strong desserts with unusual balance. If the condensed milk affogato seems too sweet that's because the donut dipping sticks are not. If the mango with sticky rice tastes different that's because there's salt in the coconut milk to keep the sugars in check.

The restaurant, named after the Ivory Coast\'s largest city, glows late into the evening, a welcoming presence on a darkened block near the Kosciusko Street station. A grid in the window displays the entire menu in 22 color photos, including several stews (called ""sauces"") paired with polished rice, boiled yams, or foutou; a pair of whole-fish platters; plus fried and jerked chicken, which are intended mainly as a come-on to non-West-African patrons.\n  ', '', 'The interior of the restaurant is deep and high-ceilinged, boasting a broad white counter at the rear that looks like the check-in desk of a modestly priced roadside motel. For some unfathomable reason, a string of holly with red berries runs along one wall up near the ceiling, while another wall is devoted to a rack of gangsta-themed videotapes from Jamaica and Nigeria. A large TV at the front of the house alternates mournful international news with Ivory Coast hip-hoppers wearing animal-print dashikis, backed up by gangs of undulant female dancers not quite in step. The proprietor will come around the counter to greet you, brandishing menus like the one in the window, only smaller and protected by plastic.', ""Fully enjoying the city's West African eateries takes some practice. You must throw away many of the assumptions you usually bring to a restaurant meal. At Abidjan, after examining the menu, one must begin by asking the jolly, gray-haired proprietor what dishes are actually available that day. Chances are it will be only four or five. In many West African restaurants, the menu is considered a speculative document, generally listing every dish the cook can think of, even ones she has no intention of making. At least the menu gives you a good idea of what constitutes everyday fare for the average Ivory Coast citizen. Without as much meat, of course."", ""Your implied social contract with this type of restaurant guarantees you'll be fed a delicious, abundant, inexpensive, and perfectly prepared meal — not that you'll be able to fully exercise your dietary preferences. In this regard, Restaurant Abidjan resembles the earliest European restaurants, medieval lodgings where the innkeeper felt obliged to feed weary travelers, but only offered a single meal assembled at his whim. Yes, Abidjan will feed you well, but you can never be sure what."", ""Toss away the idea of courses, too. There are no desserts. There no sides or apps, either, though a plate of sweet fried plantains ($6), enough for three to share, can function in a pinch as a starter, side dish, or even dessert. Also don't expect much in the way of beverages, though a pint of ginger or sorrel punch ($3.50) made with pineapple juice is often available. Leaving a burning sensation on the lips, the ginger is especially recommended. But the restaurant devotes so little attention to stocking beverages, your best bet is Mexican or Japanese beer from the Palestinian bodega a block east. Hooray for BYOB!"", ""So what should you expect to eat at Restaurant Abidjan? If you're lucky, the peanut sauce ($7) will be available. It's like a liquid peanut butter sandwich, though one that has meat bobbing in it – either lamb, oxtail, or chicken, depending on the mood of the cook. Order foutou to go with it. This is a mash made of plantain flour, notable for its bouncy texture and plainish flavor. Nip off a piece with your thumb and forefinger and dip it deeply in the sauce, then close your eyes and chew. There are other mashes, too, including placali, an oblong wad of fermented yuca with a sour taste, said to satisfy hunger longer than milder mashes. Other alternatives include a plain plate of polished white rice, and something called tomato rice ($5), which is a moist morass of grain soaked in red sauce with some mixed vegetables thrown in, tasting like something you might find in a Spanish or Mexican restaurant."", ""Sporadically available are okra, palm-oil, eggplant, and chicken sauces ($7 each). The okra provides a lesson in mucoidal viscosity, and every friend I've taken to taste it has fallen immediately in love. If nothing else, the sauce demonstrates a familial connection between Louisiana Creole and West African cuisines. The palm oil sauce is reminiscent of the kind of canned meat gravy you might ladle over your instant mashed potatoes in Mid-America."", 'The dish presentation is refreshingly rudimentary. Grilled lamb ($7) is three good-size chops accompanied by nothing but a pool of the same tomato relish we\'ve seen before. Paleo dieters take note. Something you shouldn\'t miss once you\'ve tried the peanut and okra sauces is the national dish: a fried whole snapper, head on, accompanied by attieke (pronounced ""ah-check-ay""), a tart stodge of fermented manioc meal that looks like white couscous. As with the sauces and mashes, you must buy the components of the meal separately ($12 and $3, respectively). To fully enjoy the attieke — which can be a bit dry on its own — mix the tomato relish and chopped French salad that comes with the fish into the starch before consuming it.', ""On the other hand, the perfect fried chicken ($7) beckons.

Both criticisms have some merit. Baskets of dumplings start at $5.55, about a dollar higher than average, based on my dim sum expeditions. One way to keep down the cost is to avoid the nontraditional dishes. Honey baked sea bass for $19.95? Curried cream cheese shrimp wanton for $10.50? Pass and pass. Sticking largely to the classics, my group got out for around $33 a head.', 'At dim sum I want to gorge on translucent, pert, just-steamed dumplings, and on that  score Yank Sing delivers beautifully.

Try the baked cha siu bao (smooth pucks filled with sweet-and-sour pork barbecue) over their steamed counterparts.

Sure, grab some spring rolls if they beckon. Just not the ones gilded with sea bass. For dessert the sesame balls come straight from the fryer; the staff cuts them open to reveal their creamy-sweet interior. A couple bites of egg custard tart cut the last few sips of strong tea.

The stew exuded the traditional warmth of red chile paste, but the seasoning was more intense and immediate than I've ever tried before in Korean cooking. It took saltiness to the same enjoyable brink as the dishes at a restaurant like Animal. It tasted distinctly American in that way. "", 'Welcome to chef Roy Choi\'s latest triumph Pot. Choi is of course most famous for his Kogi BBQ food truck, which brought Asian-Mexican tacos to the world. He, along with David Chang, ushered in Korean cuisine\'s ascendance into pop culture, a long time in coming. (Ruth Reichl wondered why Korean food wasn\'t more popular in the pages of the New York Times in 1993.) Choi\'s other restaurants, including A-Frame and rice bowl-themed Chego, blend global flavors overtly. Pot fixes more directly on Korean flavors, but through Choi\'s personal sensibilities. That\'s likely why Choi gives the seafood soup a catchy moniker that conjures the San Francisco icon, rather than calling it by the Korean name, mae-un-tang. All the hot pots on the menu have similarly quippy titles, like ""Inside Story"" (featuring offal) and Boot Knocker (a riff on a dish called ""troop soup"" with origins in the Korean War). Choi grew up in a Korean restaurant, but these aren\'t his family\'s recipes. ', ""Pot is housed in the Line Hotel in the heart of L.A.'s Koreatown, and it forever rewires the notion of a hotel restaurant. The space is trippy, a sort of otherworldly cafeteria, with an eighties-era dropped ceiling and twinkly recessed lighting, hanging ferns, and imprints of flora and fauna on the wall—including a cannabis leaf to help fuel the inevitable pot double-entendres. Diners often start with a drink in the ring-shaped bar. I didn't take a shine to the uni cocktail that's all the chatter: My version was pummeled with cumin. But I can't wait to return to the restaurant itself and explore more of the huge menu presented on newspaper. "", ""On the night I ate at Pot, a few weeks after its opening, the crowd was predominately Asian. The neighborhood is embracing Choi's vision. I've no doubt the rest of the world will follow. "", ""Sqirl is compact, the prototype for small Southern California restaurants: a collage of metals, woods, and white surfaces, with inside seating that's either communal or along a counter, and a scattering of tables on a sidewalk patio. It started out even tinier. Chef-owner Jessica Koslow, who began her business making sublime local fruit jams and selling them at farmers markets, expanded the space last summer.  "", 'There is a line to order and it moves glacially. But everyone around me looks unusually content while they eat. The chalkboard menu lists both breakfast and lunch menus. It includes brioche toast with sweet or savory toppings; salads and a Kokuho Rose brown rice bowl with sorrel pesto, preserved Meyer lemon, black radishes, and feta; and more substantial mains like roast chicken and lamb tagine. ', ""I'm ornery with hunger and greed by the time I reach the front of the line and order a toast with jam—choosing all three options of blueberry-rhubarb, blood orange marmalade, and strawberry-rose-geranium— as well as a farro salad, a slice of quiche, and a macchiato.""]"

The real gem in the meat-bearing mezze department is kibbe naya ($10), a tartare of raw lamb macerated with spices and served with three accompaniments: olive oil, the fiery paste called harissa, and toum – a fluffy white substance doubtlessly inspired by French aioli.

The town was carved from a tree nursery owned by one M.A. Murray around 1890, but nowadays, most of the land is occupied by trim stuccoed houses and brick apartment buildings, while the balance is mainly small cafes, brightly decorated with colorful signs broadcasting their specialties.

Here and there, broad-flanked Black Angus cattle pose in pastures like magazine pin-ups, as if too aware of their intrinsic attractiveness. From a raised platform a manager surveys the room, monitoring the comings and goings of employees dashing around the room like cowpokes, setting up and breaking down barbecues, distributing bottles of beer and platters of raw meat, busing tables, and forestalling groups of diners waiting hungrily in a knot just inside the door."", '', ""But why should you venture to this quaint but rather obscure spot rather than going to any other Korean barbecue in town?

Top of the line is marinated kalbi, which is fatty beef rib stripped from the bone and soaked in a solution of soy and Asian pear, tenderizing the beef and imparting a slightly sweet and salty taste. For Texans and other barbecue purists, there's an unmarinated version available."", ""Pork belly is a compulsory offering for any Korean barbecue joint, thick slices of unsmoked bacon that's mainly fat. Tragically, this cut cannot be cooked directly over the charcoal because it would burst into flame like an improvised explosive device and send diners scurrying from the restaurant. Accordingly, the belly is seared on a domed contraption placed over the grill that prevents it from absorbing much smoke. It's great anyway. The fourth and last choice is also piggy: fat-rimmed ribs that look like boneless pork chops, which cook up nice and smoky directly over the flame."", 'Portions of kalbi are priced at $34.95, with the pork belly and pork ribs a few dollars less. The tables are set up for four or more diners (never go alone to a place like this), and one can easily order one less portion than the number of diners. It still sounds expensive, right? Wrong! With every allotment of barbecue comes a panoply of accompanying dishes, plus unlimited rice.', 'Banchan, kimchi', ""First to hit the table like a flock of birds settling on a field of grain are the banchan – small dishes served in bowls and on saucers. Those accustomed to eating in Korean restaurants offering four or five of these in a predictable vein will be astonished by Mapo's banchan. On a more recent visit in early spring, three friends and I received 13. Besides the obvious cabbage kimchee, shredded daikon pickle, and cucumber salad, we got sweetened shavings of dried squid, boiled eggs, and chiles in soy sauce, sweet potato noodles with slivers of vegetable, mushroom stems in a tart salty dressing, sweet thick swatches of tofu skin, and ripply cubes of something amusingly called devil's tongue jelly, dressed with scallions and sesame oil."", ""Each dish was like a little adventure, though my fellow diners that evening didn't admire the potato puree that constituted a weak stab at American potato salad. These banchan serve a triple function throughout the meal: as appetizers, as side dishes, and as condiments with the grilled meat. By the way, when you run out of any of them – the long-aged cabbage kimchee is invariably gone by the middle of your repast – you should ask the waitress for more, and she readily complies."", ""You can almost hear a drum roll as the barbecue accoutrements arrive – a guy dashes up to the table and stops abruptly, holding with tongs a blackened metal vessel glowing with lump charcoal. Everyone pulls back apprehensively as he thrusts the smudge pot into a depression in the middle of the table, shooting up sparks into the overhead hood. Another employee installs a stainless steel grill over the live charcoal. Next the waitress appears with your meat. She ostentatiously displays the well-marbled meat, then shows us the bones it was cut from, picked clean, to demonstrate we weren't being cheated. We hadn't mistrusted her for a moment."", 'Multiple stages of cooking the marinated kalbi', ""An important note: In general, you must order two portions of barbecue to be allowed to cook it at the table. Order one and they'll do it for you in the kitchen and deliver it already grilled. This could actually be good in summer if you don't want to sit on top of glowing coals. Even when you barbecue at the table, the waitress does most of the work, flopping the meat, snipping it with scissors into smaller chunks, then mounting the grill on an elevated rack and pushing the meat to the sides when it's perfectly done. At this point you serve yourself from the grill using chopsticks, or push the meat to the center if you want it done further or blackened to crispness. My advice: don't. The meat is tenderest when rare, and further grilling, while adding smokiness, can make the meat tough."", ""The waitress shows us the bones, picked clean, to demonstrate we weren't being cheated."", ""Chunks of beef or pork should be wrapped in the oak leaf lettuce provided. Smear on a little bean paste, and then add some of the marinated onions, or a clove of garlic. Indeed, some kimchee or one of the other banchan can be also included in the lettuce packet. If you get pork belly, you should dip it in a condiment of sesame oil, salt, and pepper that is provided before wrapping it in lettuce. Ultimately, there's so much meat in an order at Mapo, you may find yourself indulgently eating it with no accompaniments at all."", '', 'A compelling free side: creamed corn', ""In addition to meat and banchan, there are free side dishes, too, believe it or not. One is a sort of sizzling soufflé in a stone crock, to be spooned up like pudding; another holds soon dubu, which is fresh tofu in a fiery stew; and, weirdest of all, a platter of creamed corn like you might find at a potluck church supper. You'll never go hungry at Mapo, but you may feel overwhelmed with all the details of what is essentially a prix fixe feast."", ""But other dishes beckon from the menu, too. The mandoo gui dumplings ($14.95) are clearly homemade, and available either in soups or pan-fried (pick the latter). No vermicelli inside, but finely chopped greens and shredded pork. These are not part of the meal, but must be ordered separately. Other house specialties include the spicy red stews called jigaes; the seafood, tofu, or kimchee pancakes known as pajeon; steak tartare; and various noodle and seafood stir-fries. You don't really need these dishes, volume-wise, and it's nearly impossible to specify when they should arrive during your dinner. In general, they just mean a distraction from the rest of the voluminous meal."", '', 'Icy cold mul naeng myun', ""So skip them, with one exception besides the mandoo: The usual conclusion to a meal of Korean barbecue, which is all fire and smoke, is a cooling bowl of mul naeng myun ($17.95), either with or without broth. The fine-bore buckwheat noodles are pleasantly frigid and slippery, and the waitress snips them in the bowl with sliced beef, boiled egg, and Asian pear. Order them, and if you happen to not be Korean, or have Korean friends along with you, she'll look at you with renewed respect."", 'Email Robert Sietsema at robert@eater.com and follow him @robertsietsema.', 'Cost: Dinner for four, with mandoo gui, a few beers, and a shared serving of naeng myun afterwards, $160 pre-tip.', 'Sample dishes: Kalbi (marinated boneless beef rib), dweji kalbi (boneless pork rib), mandoo gui (pan-fried dumplings)', 'What to drink: Beer (try Korean beers Hite or OB) and soju (a distilled sweet-potato beverage something like weak vodka)', ""Bonus tip: If you don't have a friend with a car, the easiest way to get to Mapo is from Pennsylvania Station via the Long Island Rail Road to the Murray Hill stop (ride in the last four cars).

His expression was tender. He was smiling to himself. He looked like he was practicing tai chi, each movement studied and precise. Each time he coupled a sculpted piece of fish with its thumb-size portion of seasoned rice, Urasawa placed the sushi before him and paused for an instant to consider his handicraft. Then he lightly painted it with a soy sauce mixture. Some pieces would be dribbled with freshly squeezed yuzu juice; a few received a flurry of green yuzu zest.', ""And when, one at a time, he laid the series of ten or so morsels in front of his tiny band of customers, we snatched them in a flash. We were following instructions. At the onset of the extravagant sushi progression, the meal's pinnacle, Urasawa had told us to eat every piece within ten seconds. Dude was dead serious."", 'I had read about the ""ten-second rule"" in online reports on Urasawa. It\'s one of several commands to be obeyed throughout the evening—and one of several reasons why the self-named Beverly Hills hideaway is among the most polarizing restaurants in Los Angeles. In 2003, ""Hiro"" Urasawa took over the space, then called Ginza Sushi-ko, when its owner (and Urasawa\'s mentor) Masayoshi Takayama moved to New York to open Masa in the Time Warner Center. It took a couple years for the protégé to solidify his own style—less flamboyant and more tradition-minded than Takayama\'s, though certainly as luxurious—but Angelinos came to embrace him as one of their finest sushi chefs.', 'The ones who could afford it did, anyway. A meal at Urasawa currently starts at $395. Including one relatively modest half-bottle of sake, tax, and tip, my solo bill came in just under $650. The experience is based on kaiseki, the Japanese predecessor of tasting menus, with a choreographed sequence of small hot and cold dishes meant to kindle all the senses. Guests sit for hours while servers monitor every move, constantly replenishing drinks and explaining dishes in reverential whispers.', 'So is it worth it? Obviously it depends first on whether a person finds spending that kind of money on dinner impossible, revolting, or irresistible. Local critics, interestingly, are divided. Last year Jonathan Gold of the Los Angeles Times put Urasawa at number two on his list of L.A.\'s 101 Best Restaurants, noting that ""you will still find no better evocation of Japan in America."" Los Angeles magazine just released their list of L.A.\'s 75 best restaurants in its May issue, and the mag\'s reviewer Patric Kuh wrote a blog post explaining why he didn\'t include Urasawa at all: ""A prohibitively expensive Japanese restaurant inside a real estate development feels, well, kind of passé.""', ""I did find the location disorienting. The restaurant is ensconced on the second floor of a building that's part of Two Rodeo, an outdoor shopping complex near the corner of Dayton Way and North Rodeo Drive. Google Maps couldn't quite help me pinpoint the entrance to the underground parking. I was eight minutes late to my 7:30 reservation, and one of the soft-spoken servers was waiting for me by the door. She led me to the 10-person sushi counter and, with a nod from the chef, sat me directly in front of Urasawa. There was a group of three women to my right, a party of four to my left, and empty seats on either side of me. We were the sum of the evening's customers. The room was simple, with walls painted gold and sage and white. Urasawa was dressed in a black kimono-like haori with the sleeves tied back. Blowsy cherry blossoms splayed from a vase behind him. I was flustered from being late—not cool, I knew, in this regimented atmosphere. Then I ran my hands over the sandy-colored cypress bar, buffed down nightly, and exhaled. Its smooth touch relaxed me like grass under my feet."", 'The first dish arrived, a slice of seared toro wrapped around ankimo (monkfish liver) and crowned with a hillock of caviar. The seafood tasted like purity itself, with the pop of the roe offsetting the play of creamy and supple textures. It made quite the first impression. And so beautiful! I pulled out my camera, and one of the servers promptly appeared at my right shoulder: ""I\'m sorry, no photos.""', 'More wonderments followed, though: A variation on goma dofu, a dumpling made from black sesame paste, stuffed with uni and topped with a bit of edible gold leaf. There appeared a black spoon of half wagyu beef tartare and half caviar, finished with diced pickled radish. On the side was a small square of red pepper. ""Eat the whole spoonful,"" Urasawa said. ""Then eat the pepper."" An earthy chaser after a decadent mouthful—I liked how it jangled the brain. One of Urasawa\'s signatures emerged: pristine sashimi (toro, Japanese snapper, Spanish mackerel) arranged over an ice sculpture that seemed to radiate from within, like Superman\'s Fortress of Solitude.', ""A shabu shabu course included various seafood and meats we swished around in broth and ate one at a time, in an order directed by Urasawa so each would be ideally cooked. Then the servers removed the vessel and returned with bowls of the cooking elixir. By this time I was in a trance. It wasn't until the next day I remembered the shabu shabu's climactic protein, foie gras, is banned for sale in California. Let's consider it the evening's one complimentary item. And it was extraordinarily silky."", ""I started trying to sneak iPhone pics until the server came back to admonish me more firmly. It made me angry, which is not something a customer should feel when they're shelling this much out. Despite the ban, the Internet is rife with blog snapshots from Urasawa, and I also noticed that no one in the favored party to my left—the host was in for the second time that week—was chastised when any of them whipped out their smartphones."", 'Hiro Urasawa after making matcha tea', ""Not to slur that gracious bunch. They adopted me as their fifth, pouring me floral sake and folding me into their conversation. We whooped together over the sushi and sighed over dessert: a slice of blessedly ripe papaya fused with a layer of grapefruit gelée. On the side: one raw, intense yamamomo, or mountain peach. Urasawa, relaxed at meal's end, whipped frothy matcha tea with a whisk whose shape reminded me of an old-fashioned shaving brush. The group rushed in front of Urasawa and snapped his picture; I took one, too, with no resistance."", ""The dinner was astonishing; I'll be judging the sushi against all others for years to come. Would I return? Probably once in a decade, and only then if I was feeling especially flush. It isn't an accessible restaurant; it wasn't designed to be. I'll confess I feel guilty over the amount of over-fished (admittedly sublime) Bluefin tuna I consumed. Urasawa receives daily seafood deliveries from Japan and uses every part of the fish, but still. I'd request my next meal sans Bluefin. The very idea would likely befuddle or sadden Urasawa. More than any taste, I'll remember the pleasure of his concentration as he formed the nigiri. But that kind of ecstasy comes at a price—in more ways than one."", 'How much does it cost? $395 per person. Yes, it\'s one of the country\'s most expensive restaurants.How to get in? Leave a phone message and a staffer will return the call. The counter seats 10 people and there\'s another, disconnected-feeling table off to the side. Despite the size it\'s possible to score reservations often in the same week.What to expect? An exquisite progression of seasonal kaiseki (small hot and cold dishes) followed by eight or ten pieces of insanely fresh sushi.  What to drink: Sake (a knowledgeable server can guide you to something in line with your price and tastes) and green tea. Bonus tip: Know that the idea of ""the customer is always right"" doesn\'t exist here. Give in to Urasawa\'s flow and order and the evening will be memorable.']"

But I may be keener on the other trending, brothy wonder whose excellence also proves elusive—xiao long bao, the round soup dumplings that hail from Shanghai. Most XLBs reveal some sort of construction flaw when consumed: The pleated wrappers are too thin and they leak or rip when lifted from the bottom of the steamer basket, or the dough is too thick and they bloat unappetizingly. I've occasionally stumbled onto an optimal batch at a restaurant only to return and find them off. To butcher Emerson: Consistency is the hobgoblin of xiao long bao."", ""Din Tai Fung, a growing chain out of Taiwan, seems to have mastered the formula. The company opened its first U.S. location in 2000 in Arcadia, a city in the San Gabriel Valley (less than 15 miles from downtown Los Angeles), which is the country's epicenter for XLB culture. Lines can snake out the doors on weekends. Its popularity led to a second nearby restaurant, basically to handle overflow. Two outposts appeared in Washington State; one is coming to Orange County this summer."", '', 'The third L.A.-area Din Tai Fung, launched last year, is a glossy affair in nearby Glendale that befits its surroundings in the Kardashian-friendly mall complex called The Americana at Brand. Those arriving at prime dining hours can expect a wait and a text message when a table is ready. Three of us came during the late side of lunch on a Friday and snagged seats immediately. The glass-front entrance led to an interior of woods and stones and neutral colors—the dumpling parlor as spa foyer. A server set down a sheet of paper with lists of dishes on both sides, and we ticked off our order and handed it back to him.', '', ""The XLB landed and … jackpot. These babies are the waterbeds of the food world, sloshy but sealed with precision engineering. We used our chopsticks to lift the dumplings onto a spoon, speckled them with black vinegar and a couple slivers of ginger, and then nibbled off a bit of the dumpling's top to slurp out the liquid. As the XLB cooled, we skipped the ritual and started popping them into our mouths whole."", 'The time-honored XLB—listed on the menu as ""juicy pork dumplings""—proved the most rewarding, with the meat and the viscous broth melding into a porcine cumulous cloud. I was also smitten with a soup dumpling variation of dim sum favorite siu mai, in which the dough is twisted into an hourglass shape and crowned with a small shrimp. A version with a dash of crab in with the pork? Too fishy. We tried a few other dishes: some mustard greens perky with ginger, chewy oval rice cakes (another Shanghainese specialty) sautéed with chicken and vegetables, a lumpy rice cake, rich with soy sauce, that reminded me of well-seasoned congee. All enjoyable enough, but the XLB easily commanded the spotlight.', '', 'One dish on the list caught my attention: ""Small dumplings with soup, weekends only, limited."" I scouted online and saw that these have become something of a cult item. The old restaurant truism: Limited supply creates demand. But my curiosity was sparked, and frankly I wanted more soup dumplings. So the next day—a Saturday—I trekked out to the original (and much more humble) location in Arcadia and met some friends at 11 a.m. We scored our batch of small dumplings, and though they were as adorable as buttons, they didn\'t hold much broth. Verdict: Overhyped.', '', ""But the xiao long bao were outstanding, still hermetic but even more swelled with liquid. I like to think there's a competition between Din Tai Fung locations over which of them makes the finest XLB. I spied hunched-over crews crimping blobs of dough through windowed rooms in both restaurants. They wore lab coats and fixated on their labors with the concentration of jewelers. The workers in Glendale may toil in tonier digs, but the craftspeople in Arcadia make the better dumplings."", 'How much does it cost? Appetizers $3.80-$4.50; most dumpling, noodle, and rice dishes $7.50-$10; desserts $2-$5.80. What to order: Xiao long bao (listed on the menu as ""juicy pork dumplings""), shrimp and pork ""shao mai,"" mustard greens with shredded ginger, Shanghai rice cake. If you have room for dessert, try the red bean dumplings. What to drink: The original Arcadia location doesn\'t serve alcohol; follow the mostly Asian crowd and order tea for the table. The Americana at Brand location has a full bar and unusual concoctions like cold green tea topped with cream and sea salt.

And I'm told it was once an excellent place to eat.\n  "", 'The first time I visited Saul back in 2012 in its now-closed Carroll Gardens space, my companion and I were among the only guests in the dining room. We spent about $200 on pasta with a poached egg and a few other forgettable dishes. It was April, and ""Jingle Bell Rock"" was playing on the sound system.', ""The second time I visited Saul was this month at its new location in the Brooklyn Museum, where the music (Neil Young) was better than the original, where the crispy octopus could've come from a high-end Spanish spot, and where the main courses were among the worst I've encountered in a New York restaurant. Has Saul's time passed?"", 'Squab; Octopus', ""Atlantic bass was stripped of its succulent skin and rendered flavorless. A single lamb chop ($34) contained about three bites of meat and twice as much fat. Squab breast ($35) tasted closer to raw than rare while its undercooked skin would've been better suited for the jaws of a Rottweiler."", 'And then there was an off-the-menu daiquiri, sour, viscous and, somewhat different from a traditional version. ""It was probably made with lemon,"" a waitress told me during a later visit. ""We don\'t have any limes in the restaurant."" So while other venues have found ways to deal with the temporarily high price of that citrus fruit by eating the cost or raising prices, Saul has stopped carrying them altogether.', ""So there's your neighborhood hospitality for you. Though keep in mind that Saul is no longer a mom and pop shop."", 'Museums, along with stadiums and concert halls, have been overhauling their culinary offerings this past decade to cater to gastronomic-savvy guests.', ""While the chef is still Saul Bolton, the venue is a collaboration with Restaurant Associates, the company that caters many of the exorbitant charity banquets that your hedge fund buddies invite you to; they also run other museum restaurants like Wolfgang Puck's The Source at The Newseum in Washington and Marcus Samuelsson's American Table at Lincoln Center. And if you want to drill down even further, Restaurant Associates is part of Compass Group, a global foodservice organization with a market cap of £16.89 billion (USD ~ $28.4 billion). Too bad these smart folks can't figure out the economics on limes."", 'Saul has, however, figured out how to charge you a bunch of money. The tasting menu is $85. Not a single dinner entree is under $30. And an a la carte meal will easily run $100 per person.', 'Pol Roger, the only bottle of Champagne, costs $110, a higher starting price for high-end French bubbly than other, better restaurants.

The trick of course is to accommodate daytime or early-evening eaters who want to get in and out fast (or back to the exhibits), while also courting destination diners who can fill the restaurant and settle in after the museum closes. Danny Meyer has perhaps struck this balance better than anyone else at The Modern, a Michelin-starred spot with small plates in its bar room and set-menu dining in the back.

The hosts may or may not greet you on the way in or out. Charming, right?"", '', ""And then there's the question of ambience. When dining in a museum, it's nice to actually see the museum. Those seated in the spendy back room at The Modern are treated to a panoramic view of that institution's famed sculpture garden via floor to ceiling windows. Those who dine at Saul might have partial views of the wrong side of a bike exhibit. I say wrong side because there was a spotlight shining on it from the opposite side, and into my eyes, on Saturday."", '', 'Sorrel leaf', 'Yes, you forget about some of these ignominies when the amuse arrives. The chef sends out a sorrel leaf topped with toasted quinoa and a hint of maple — a ""leaf taco"" that bursts of citrus and sugar. And Saul is a serviceable enough space for a glass of Peter Zemmer pinot noir ($15) with a plate of charcuterie ($18); the meat platter includes heady lamb terrine, passable head cheese, silky liver pâté, smoky rabbit rillettes, curried cauliflower, and pickled crosnes.', ""Then you notice that you're sitting funny; it's because the seats are too narrow from back to front, imparting the sensation that you might slide off. In other words, Saul, with about half the charm of Houston's or any other restaurant located in Long Island's Roosevelt Field shopping mall, is not where you want to have a tasting menu."", 'The $85 tasting menu starts off right but hits some major speedbumps.', 'To be fair, that $85 option starts off right, with a vinegared oyster, and a sweet-sour beet salad that somehow rises above the mediocre ubiquity that dish has attained in recent years; Saul throws in a few dried strawberries, gooseberries, and just enough vinegar to keep all the sugars in check.', ""Then you're served a cup of vegan carrot-ginger soup that wouldn't pass muster at Whole Foods. Nasty stuff. It's also large enough to serve as a small meal in itself. That's followed by a preternaturally sweet diver scallop. Right on. Too bad the mollusk is paired with a Persian lime-spiked labneh that tastes precisely like what would happen if someone accidentally dumped a packet of unsweetened Purplesaurus Rex Kool-Aid into a vat of yogurt."", 'Sweet and sour beet salad; Scallops; Wagyu steak', ""And whoever is cooking the Wagyu skirt steak isn't rendering out the intramuscular fat, and as a result I chewed over fifty times to render one of the pieces swallowable. Cracking a winter lobster with my bare hands would've been less burdensome. The meal ended with a leaden macaron so dense it could double as a protective jewelry box, as well as a pâté de fruit whose density was closer to Chuckles than a good French candy."", ""Smart folks will take their post-Museum meals elsewhere, perhaps at Marco's just a mile away, serving one of New York's best rotisserie chickens. But the unlucky who are dragged to eat here should order a la carte, and they'll be in and out quickly enough, as Restaurant Associates runs a tight ship with fine service."", '', 'Charcuterie board', ""There are no snacks, mid-courses, small plates, or nose-to-tail, large format feasts, just old-school appetizers, entrees, and desserts. So do the charcuterie platter, as well as the beet salad or raw fluke with chile and lemon. Halibut with butter and peas flakes like it should in a three-star restaurant, and rabbit three ways (breast, leg, and fatty rib) scores three ways. Pork chops ($35) boast as much musk as dry aged game; too bad they're as tough as leather. A serrated knife barely cuts through the meat and the skin is so toothsome it would be better off tanned, laced, and thrown into the end zone."", ""Desserts — those tasting menu mignardises aside — are impressive. Panna cotta is infused with the sweet, vegetal flavor of asparagus; pea sorbet on top adds a grassy jolt. And Baked Alaska turns out to be a lemon meringue tarte with inverted proportions; there's twice as much soft egg white as sour lemon curd. Clever."", 'Then you walk out and see one of the hosts is checking her iPhone while the other is staring at a computer.

The appeal of restaurants that limit choices has been debated ad nauseam in the last couple years. I'm entirely middle-path on the subject: I have no problem with hours of eating, so long as I push back from the table satisfied. Regarding Alma and Trois Mec, I emerged from my meal at one of them more than content—elated. At the other, I left perplexed. The differences seemed reflective of where chefs Ari Taymor (Alma) and Ludo Lefebvre (Trois Mec) are in their respective careers."", 'Our willowy server sets down two plates with deep, round indentations. ""We call it \'The Central Coast,\'"" she says. The mischief in her eye conveys a message: Don\'t worry about what\'s in it, just enjoy. The topographical reference becomes clear after the first mouthful. A fog covering of smoked halibut brandade gives way to a puree of Tetragon spinach bright in color and flavor. Cradled between this heaven and earth are Dungeness crab and a bit of caviar. It\'s the essence of California, and I immediately understand why chef Ari Taymor has received so many local and national raves. Then the meal slowly coasts downhill.', 'Taymor and co-owner Ashleigh Parsons opened Alma in June 2012 after months as a pop-up project. They found a space on a desolate but fascinating block of downtown LA. The restaurant\'s knotty wood façade stands in broad contrast to the weathered building next door, whose sign reads ""Club Las Palmas Hostess Dancing."" Shades diffuse the intense, early-evening light streaming into Alma\'s dining room, a Danish Modern tableau of white walls and dangling geometric fixtures.', 'I immediately understand why chef Ari Taymor has recieved so many local and national raves. Then the meal slowly coasts downhill.', ""Taymor worked at Bay Area restaurants like Flour + Water and Bar Tartine, and at garden-centric La Chassagnette in Arles, France, before settling in LA. He's young, 28 years old, and even in the breadth of one meal I could sense that as a chef he's in the throes of evolution—a culinary X-Man (super power: filtering New Nordic and haute French cuisines through a warm West Coast lens) still mastering his abilities."", ""An austere bowl of peas and morels scented with mint followed The Central Coast. It was an uplifting snapshot of early spring, and also a mission statement about Taymor's uncompromising approach to quality (he even works with a gardener who sells only to Alma). As the meal progressed, I never doubted the raw product; it was the execution I sometimes questioned. A small slab of halibut glowed green from a nasturtium sauce that tasted flat and grassy. A broth of young roots with shiitakes anchored an egg yolk slow-cooked at 148 degrees for an hour and ten minutes: Its presence gave the dish a texture that fell somewhere between creamy and gluey. I opted for the $55 drink pairings with the $95 menu, and the brothy egg yolk number suffered the most discordant coupling—a Junmei sake that came off like rubbing alcohol (and I'm often a fan of sake pairings)."", 'The Central Coast; Halibut with nasturtium sauce; Frozen duck liver with smoked maple syrup and coffee granola', 'Among the two most complex creations, one seduced and the other ambushed. Crumbled bits of frozen duck liver with smoked maple syrup and coffee granola was all modern wit, a pile of rubble and smoldering flavors that evoked breakfast around a dying campfire. But the main dessert—a white chocolate semifreddo spritzed with spruce oil—hid a palate-jarring gelee made from an aggressively hoppy IPA, which literally left a bitter taste in my mouth.', ""Departing, I thought back to the snacks that landed on the table before the main courses began. Delicate seaweed and tofu beignets, the standouts, were crowd favorites when Alma was in its early days and served an a la carte menu. He could have stuck with that format, but I can see Taymor is probably too zealous for lists of appetizers and entrees. I taste ambition in his food. It'll be fascinating to see what kind of chef he develops into even a year from now."", '[Matt Kang/Eater LA]', ""Like scoring seats to watch a rock god play an intimate venue, the effort to dine at Trois Mec pays off in every way. Anyone tracking the LA dining scene at all knows about this collaboration between three headliners—Ludo Lefebvre, Vinny Dotolo, and Jon Shook. Lefebvre was chef at Gallic luminaries like L'Orangerie and Bastide and then found his true métier staging sold-out pop-ups called LudoBites; he's one of the judges on The Taste alongside Nigella Lawson and Anthony Bourdain. Dotolo and Shook, two Florida boys, brought rockabilly edge to Southern California cooking at Animal and Son of a Gun. The duo councils on food and business matters at Trois Mec but Lefebvre runs the kitchen most nights. The restaurant hides in plain sight in a squat Hollywood strip mall, behind opaque glass and under a neon yellow sign for Raffallo's Pizza."", ""Diners need tickets for Trois Mec's five-course menu (which includes sweet and savory extras): They cost around $100 each and are available on troismec.com every other Friday at 8 a.m. PST, or through MasterCard's Priceless.com on Wednesdays at 9 a.m. Anyone serious about gaining entrance best be hovering over the keyboard; tickets can vanish in less than five minutes."", 'Two of us landed front-seat views at the counter overlooking Lefebvre and his corps in the open kitchen, which takes up about as much of the space as the 26-seat dining room. Straight away, a cook passed us earthen cups filled with buckwheat popcorn, which crunched and twanged like Grape Nuts crossed with salt and vinegar potato chips. Among the speedy succession of snacks was a square of garlic bread, an homage to the surroundings that recalled the yeasty, cheesy perfume that hangs in the air of every college town slice joint.', 'Dungeness crab ceviche; Striped bass with white asparagus; Beef tenderloin with smoked peanut butter, charred broccoli, and shallot bits.', 'But any cutesy allusions disappeared with the first course—a lilting Dungeness crab ceviche dotted with citrus and snug beneath sheer avocado slices. Like the crab dish at Alma, the composition distilled the Golden State in a few dreamy bites.', ""But then the dinner grew more exhilarating. A grilled cabbage leaf accented with grated egg yolk and draped over smoked almond milk anglaise and miso flan has been a part of the menu for months. It's not particularly seasonal; the combinations sound random. It was genius, though—the ingredients conspired to bring out the sweetness in cabbage's personality, an intervention to coax out its highest potential. Equally sublime courses ensued: steamed striped bass gently buoyed by white asparagus, fried fennel fronds, and petals of yucca flowers; strips of beef punched up with smoked peanut butter, charred broccoli, and a shower of crisp shallot bits."", 'General manager Adam Vourvoulis compiled two French-leaning wine pairings, a $49 option and a $79 reserve upgrade, drawing on Chinons and Burgundies as well as more obscure varietals like Sylvaner and Savennières. We had one of each to compare, and both proved canny with the food. Vourvoulis also pours non-alcoholic pairings, made in-house with teas or juices pressed from the skins and pulp of local fruit.', 'What an event—the sure rhythms of the cooks and the staff, the obvious joy of the diners.', ""The finale: a shallow bowl of apple butter glossed with brie cream and toasted barley that straddled the line between pleasurably sweet yet intriguingly savory. What an event—the sure rhythms of the cooks and the staff, the obvious joy of the diners. Lefebvre (who turned 43 last week) was in the center of it, looking over shoulders, finishing plates, and flashing his TV-ready smile. I would worry that this scale of success might be fleeting, but the owners are plotting another restaurant next door called Petit Trois. Still, grab seats when you can. A venue this welcoming, with a stratospheric talent cooking like he's already proven himself (which he has), is rare. Rock on, Ludo.""]"

But in the last few years, several Miami restaurant groups have emerged with smart, mid-scale restaurants to help counterbalance the glitter factories—including Miami Beach successes like Pubbelly (gastropub meets Korean and other Asian cuisines) and Yardbird (unabashed Southern cooking with fried chicken as the showpiece). "", ""Who kicked off this trend? Michael Schwartz. The Philadelphia native had cooked in South Beach restaurants for years, but in 2007 he migrated to Miami's then-transitional, now-luxe Design District and launched Michael's Genuine Food & Drink. He grilled whole fish in a wood-burning oven and made lilting salads out of vegetables culled from area farms. That may sound typical to many parts of the country; in South Florida, Schwartz's approach was radical. More than any other chef, he introduced the local-seasonal ethos to Miami. Crowds mobbed the place. The city's restaurant industry took notice. "", '', ""Fast-forward seven years: Schwartz's company, The Genuine Hospitality Group, now operates five restaurants, seven if you include his seafaring ventures aboard Royal Caribbean cruise ships. As a frequent vacationer in South Florida, Michael's Genuine has been an old favorite. I worry, though, when chefs become more businesspeople than cooks. Does the original restaurant lose the moxie that brought them acclaim in the first place? I went to check in on Schwartz's firstborn and also to his latest Design District venture, The Cypress Room, a cozy fine dining throwback that opened last year."", ""I'll start at the finale: There's doubtful a better pastry chef in South Florida—or likely the whole state—than Hedy Goldsmith. The child-like pleasures of her desserts belie the technical savvy she employs to achieve such apparent simplicity. "", ""I ordered a strawberry-rhubarb parfait at the end of a long meal—it was the option that most conjured spring. What arrived was a fruit crisp re-engineered to fit in a jar. A fresh, thick confiture mingling rhubarb's tartness and strawberry's sunny sweetness had been layered with crisp, oatmeal-studded streusel and drifts of mascarpone custard. I took one spoonful and didn't look up until I had finished scraping the glass spotless. Only then did my attention turn to two beautifully misshapen doughnuts with a small dish of raspberry jam for dipping and a crock of lemon pot de crème for smooth, invigorating contrast. "", 'Without dessert, I probably would not have left Michael\'s Genuine quite as ecstatic. The meal was reminiscent of a small-town fireworks display: It began with a bang but then sputtered through the middle before rallying for an eye-popping finish. The menu is divided into plates of four sizes: small, medium, large, and extra-large. I wanted to try a dish from each section. When two of us asked to share the roasted chicken from the extra-large options, our server said, ""Oh! Did you know that dish takes an hour?"" Hmm, no. Might be helpful to include a note about that detail.', ""So we filled the time with memorable dishes made with the top-notch ingredients on which Michael Schwartz hangs his reputation: a rich concoction of farm egg, gruyere, and tomato baked until bubbly and crusty on top; nicely singed octopus with a salad of gigantes beans, roasted peppers, and a scattering of herbs; an entree of locally caught, grouper-like wreckfish sparked with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette and a bouquet of arugula. And we had plenty of time to soak in the scene around us. Few seats on the restaurant's patio—a plant-filled courtyard surrounded by clothing stores—or in the dining room stayed empty for long. As daylight fades, the restaurant's interior takes on a crimson glow from massive square fixtures overhead: They look like Rubik's Cubes with whom someone grew impatient and painted a solid red. "", 'Finally our chicken arrived. It was fragrant from its time in the wood oven, comely with its crown of plumped raisins and pine nuts … and dry. It had cooked about ten minutes too long. So had a side of roasted broccoli—the tips of the florets tasted dusty they were so desiccated.', ""Thankfully, those desserts immediately lifted spirits. Two ill-timed dishes haven't soured me on Michael's Genuine, which retains its crackly energy and still serves food anchored by the state's bounty. From now on I'll just sidestep the extra-large menu section. "", 'General manager Amanda Su was resetting the table next to us. We watched her drape a thick white linen cloth over its top—and then she busted out a portable iron on the spot to steam out its wrinkles. When was the last time anyone gave that kind of attention to appearances in our age of casual dining?', ""The Cypress Room, which opened in March 2013, is five blocks away from Michael's Genuine but sits on a much quieter stretch, away from the crush of shops. Stepping into the restaurant feels like you're traveling much farther. Schwartz wanted the restaurant to evoke a 1920s supper club, decorating pecky cypress paneling with taxidermy (as in deer and boar heads) and other walls with ornate rose-and-cream papering. Crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and the tufted banquette is a shade of pale green that evokes funky midcentury Florida motels. The elements together create an odd, wonderful formality that doesn't take itself too seriously."", ""The restaurant might be out of character for Miami, but diners don't seem concerned: We scored the last free reservation on a recent Monday night. And the staff immediately ushered us into a gracious cocoon of comforts, beginning with some finely tuned cocktails. The Thunderball (Atlantico Anejo rum, orange, pineapple, Cardamaro) harmonized in calypso rhythms along with red shrimp sashimi bathed in coconut milk and lime and dotted with puffed rice for a pop of texture. "", ""Schwartz and chef de cuisine Roel Alcudia (who previously held the same position at Jonathan Waxman's Barbuto in New York) create a menu that interlaces the past and the present—with steakhouse classics like bone marrow, onion soup, and filet mignon in red wine jus emerging from the same kitchen cranking out modern upscale plates. We leaned toward the more of-the-moment dishes, like cobia crudo in cucumber juice with asparagus, snow peas, a teaspoon or so of salmon roe—ideal food for the Florida weather. Lamb (rosy saddle and merguez sausage) was arranged over a ratatouille whose flavors had been merged slowly and seductively. "", ""We all have our burger fetishes; I lean toward thick, blushing hunks of beef rather than stacked thin patties. The Cypress Room's pudgy boulder of burger—made from ground chuck and the trimmings from dry-aged côte de bouef (which the restaurant serves for two) and oozing onion marmalade and a tangy New Hampshire cheese—pushed all my happy buttons. "", ""And of course we couldn't leave without sampling one of Hedy Goldsmith's desserts. As befitting the Cypress Room's tonier vibe, she dresses up her tomboyish playfulness with a bit of culinary lipstick: A coconut cake, for example, is cut into squares and splayed in a crescent moon shape over a puddle of white chocolate cream, with a side of lime ice to revive the palate after a luscious meal. "", ""How much does it cost?: Small plates $9-$13, medium plates $13-$20, large plates $19-$24, extra large plates $39 (roasted chicken) and $85 (dry-aged bone-in ribeye for two)Ideal Meal: wood-roasted farm egg with aged gruyere, house salad (ever-changing with seasonal ingredients), local fish (such as wreckfish with Meyer lemon vinaigrette), and whatever among the outstanding desserts looks most appealing.What to drink: The options on the wine list include glass pours from the Coravin, the devise that pierces through a bottle's cork without spoiling the wine inside. Oenophiles can score, say, a glass of Montrachet for $45 rather than buying the whole bottle.Bonus tip: Reserve well in advance if you're planning on a weekend meal; weekday reservations are much easier to score.""]"
399,"['\n  There\'s a small but growing pool of restaurants like Empellon and Pujol that are modernizing and reinventing Mexican fare, mixing traditional techniques with avant-garde ones and charging accordingly for the delicious privilege. And then there\'s Mission Cantina on Manhattan\'s Lower East Side, where a poster of Jenny McCarthy squirting mustard hangs on the wall, where Snoop Dogg\'s ""Gin and Juice"" pipes through the sound system, and where chefs use beef from humanely-raised cows to make sloppy, gloppy, double decker tacos.\n  ', 'Could the bar make a fresh lemonade?', '""No, but we have orange soda,"" my waiter replied, and I briefly thought about asking whether they had a Doritos Loco taco to go with that. Instead, I ordered one of New York\'s most expensive burritos at $14.', '', ""So yeah. That's Cantina in a nutshell. It's all the work of Danny Bowien, a 32 year-old chef born in South Korea, raised in the Midwest and exalted by the U.S. culinary community for Mission Chinese, his affordable duo of late night spots in San Francisco and New York (the latter is currently a pop-up in Carroll Gardens). The great thing about that concept is that it takes a fairly static cuisine — Chinese-American take-out fare — and upends it, spiking Chongqing chicken wings with an unexpected dose of sugar, or infusing the tingly flavors of mapo tofu into a tonkatsu ramen broth. And it's all shockingly tasty."", 'Mission Cantina deserves credit for freeing Mexican fare from the handcuffs of tradition and the false perception of being cheap.', ""Mission Cantina, just the same, deserves credit for helping to free Mexican fare from the handcuffs of tradition and the false perception of being cheap. That means Bowien stuffs some of his pricey burritos with French fries. He coats tostadas with chicken liver and salmon skin for an iron-y, oily body slam. And then he sells tacos that range from very good to very average. Yep. That's the bad news. Cantina's 40-item menu is still a volatile work in progress, with more misses than there should be at a six month-old restaurant."", 'A Mission Cantina burrito', ""The burritos are not one of those misses. They're impressive, even for a critic like this one who normally looks upon that creation with the same disdain as its culinary cousin, the wrap. The key at Cantina is that the burritos come sans rice. That means the interior is more of a soft stew of nourishing deliciousness than a starchy brick. Some bites burst of beans and soft, pulled pork. Other bites pop with cilantro, avocado, onions, and scallions. It is a fine seven-layer dip rolled up into a soft flour tortilla, and after tax and tip it'll cost you over $18. It packs enough food to qualify as a large format dish, so eat half now and save the rest for later if you want to walk away from this one with no serious injuries."", 'Bowien, who walks and talks with the ease of a West Coast surfer, deserves props for mining the depths of American fast food to inform (some of) his fare. ""I grew up in Oklahoma and ate a lot of Taco Bell growing up,"" Bowien told me during a phone interview, adding that the Tex-Mex chain was his ""first exposure to real Mexican food."" My response: ""same here.""', 'In fact I\'ll go even further. Taco Bell was a vital part my coming of age as a teenager; I once held my own in the drive-through lane on a mountain bike, with a menacing SUV behind me. It was a proud day for me and a quiet victory for cyclists craving FourthMeal. So my heart swelled when I learned Cantina was riffing on Taco Bell\'s famous double decker — a recent addition. ""I didn\'t want to come out of the gate with a pseudo-trashy dish,"" Bowien said.', '', 'Double decker alambres', ""He covers a soft flour tortilla with a layer of refried beans, tops that with a corn tortilla, throws in some grilled skirt steak, jowl bacon, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, hot sauce and a crisped layer of cheddar. Sounds good, right? Problem is, it lacks the textural brilliance and structural integrity of the fast food original. If Taco Bell's version is a tender meat and bean mille-feuille, imparting legumes, crunch, and 88 percent ground beef with every bite, Mission Cantina's double decker requires fork and knife action before picking it up. And then you find yourself taking bits of grisly steak out of your mouth and give up. Cost: $8.50."", 'Chicken wings', ""Snack on spicy cucumbers instead ($6), drenched in a cooling cashew cream. Follow up with fried chicken wings ($12.50), slathered in a gently fiery mole whose chocolatey, nutty richness goes on and on. Finish off with a $40 fried rabbit that's salty, crispy, chewy and paired with a house-made hot sauce that ranks with Frank's for its addictive, vinegary punch."", ""This is strongly flavored fare that calls for the zing of margaritas. Too bad a myopic, Prohibition-era community board rejected Cantina's proposal for a full liquor license, an occurrence that's so common in contemporary New York I often joke that if Jesus Christ himself descended from the heavens and turned water into wine, his Big Apple neighbors would brand him a bootlegger."", ""This strongly flavored fare calls for the zing of margaritas. Too bad they're made with sochu."", 'So for now, there are sochu margaritas, which taste like sweetened water flavored with lime cordial. No thanks.

It's awesome."", ""What's not awesome are the menu's regular chicharrónes ($7). In the opening days of Cantina they almost seemed to crackle like Pop Rocks. Now they're painted with leaden pimento cheese, killing the delicate flavor and texture of the rind. Too bad. Also no good: A forgettable octopus tostada, fry bread topped with fresh cheese and vegetables (imagine a pizza minus salt and acid), and masa porridge with collards that taste like they came out of a can."", 'House-made corn tortillas; lamb tacos; carnitas tacos', ""And then there are the tacos ($6-$7), two to an order and about three bites each. The tortillas are (partially) made with an expensive brand of hominy called Anson Mills, so when they're good, they're great — vaguely sweet, and somehow light enough to dissolve in the mouth with little more resistance than a modernist foam. Some of the tacos come filled with lard-cooked brisket, sporting an intense umami roundness, or crispy bits of chewy pork, perfumed with cilantro. Others pack catfish so bland it's almost impossible to discern they contain any protein at all. And (overcooked) lamb tacos are so intensely seasoned with cumin and spices it's tough to discern any proper lamb flavor."", 'The key is to eat them all immediately, as the tortillas grow soggy quickly.

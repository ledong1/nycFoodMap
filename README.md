# Processing according to the article

1. Web Crawling: Get articles from restaurant ad agency.  
Data:  
  English: https://eater.com/archives; https://ny.eater.com/archives  
  Chinese: https://blog.foodmapnyc.com/  


2. Detect food entities:  
There are many food with strange names, or the resaurant could make up their own name, and the name of that food may be totally different from the resources. So the way of "incorporating generalpurpose ontologies" may not work.
: POS tags => NOUN + machine learning?




3. detarmain the relation
  Statistical Co-occurrence
  Pattern-based Approaches
  further linguistic analysis?

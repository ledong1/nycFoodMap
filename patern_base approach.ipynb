       "'the pan-regional indian restaurant sends out homey dishes with punchthe “oohs” and “ahhs” follow dum biryani ($19) as it bobs across the room. the casserole is topped by a sheet of naan dough that imprisoned the volatile flavors as the dish baked. this sealing-in is what the “dum” refers to, in a recipe attributed by the menu to the far northern city of lucknow, india, though biryani is more often associated with the southern city of hyderabad.arriving at our table, the waiter takes a big spoon and saws the nicely browned crust with a circular motion. then he flips the flap of crust over so the steam spirals out, redolent of saffron and sweet spices. inside, rice shimmers with chunks of bone-in goat and shredded herbs. the first bite proves exquisite, especially when further moistened with the tart pomegranate raita provided.“my purpose at adda,” executive chef chintan pandya told me one evening, “is to reproduce the true taste of indian home cooking.” he continued, “i’m from gujarat and mumbai and owner roni mazumdar is from kolkata in west bengal, so we come from different places, but certain things are shared. i’m trying to cook the way our mothers did.”it’s an effort rarely found in new york city indian restaurants: not only is adda making a conscientious effort to dig into the regionalities of indian cuisine, it’s doing so with accessibly priced, homestyle fare, where all dishes fall under $20. many chefs at indian restaurants in neighborhoods across nyc adapt recipes for what they think are american customer preferences, and the more ambitious pan-regional places skew more expensive, including pandya’s greenwich village restaurant rahi. but adda does neither. and the quest to replicate home cooking at adda is, perhaps, why the dishes are a degree hotter and richer, with some ingredient choices and combinations not commonly found in other new york indian restaurants. take “seasonal saag paneer” ($15). many restaurants stick to mustard greens and spinach or substitute spinach entirely, which makes for a mellower dish. but adda’s version is composed of whatever greens happen to be in the market in the moment. the other evening, it included red amaranth leaves, produce that’s common in traditional indian cooking and now stylish in the states as an antioxidant. what’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many nyc indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. the problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.the same incredible paneer constitutes a focus of the menu. have it in chile paneer tikka ($7). here, a spicy red sauce has been painted on the grilled squares; they tumble onto the plate like paving stones. less exciting is paneer khurchan, which tosses the fresh cheese with peppers in a tomato sauce that obscures the cheese’s delicate flavor. while a few indian restaurants focused on regional cuisines have incorporated pork (prevalent in goa and karnataka) and beef (a keralan favorite) into their menus, adda sticks with the standards of chicken, lamb, and goat, which pertain in most restaurants here and in india. lamb is showcased in one special, a hulking ground-meat seekh kebab ($13) that’s an especially good deal if volume of meat is your objective.but the best dish among a dozen meat and poultry choices is a goat curry called junglee maas ($18), or “wild meat,” a reference to people cooking what they hunt. goat curries, of course, are ubiquitous at punjabi steam-table restaurants throughout the city, often in stunning renditions. adda, though, one-ups even the best of them with the junglee maas. the bones are left in, as they should be, and the gravy is at once fiery and pungent. if you love goat, this curry will drive you crazy and leave your tongue burning. other standards of top steam-table restaurants are produced here in even better renditions too, including a butter chicken so rich it boasts streaks of actual butter on the surface.offal cravers will find a pao (round roll of portuguese origin) topped with chicken livers, and a bheja fry newly added to the menu — gingery goat brains. and though meat shines here, vegetarians will find plenty to love on adda’s bill of fare, including globular lotus-root kofta akin to croquettes that rest in a tomato sauce laced with fenugreek, and a tandoori-cooked cauliflower topped with a layer of amul, a processed cheese based on cheddar that’s in the same family as velveeta. my mom would have loved it. adda lies on the border of long island city and sunnyside in an industrial neighborhood, with the 7 train clattering overhead and laguardia community college directly across the street. the inside features a counter and overhang at the rear made of corrugated tin, and newspapers are plastered all over one wall, modeled after hangouts in india. while waiting for your food, study the papers for a thumbnail history of modern india.pandya and owner roni mazumdar also preside over rahi, an upmarket restaurant in the west village that plays fast and loose with indian regional cooking, sometimes inflecting it with japanese and middle eastern twists. but the food at newcomer adda is simpler, cheaper, and less beholden to current trends demanding that the camera eats first — which is a good thing, and which evokes the kind of indian food i first fell in love with at steam tables across nyc. and in pursuing the actual home cooking of regions across india, adda gives us a new perspective on an already familiar cuisine.cost: dinner for two, including two apps, two main dishes, a bread, and two indian sodas, plus tax but not tip, $60.sample dishes: kale pakoda, malvani prawn curry, seasonal saag paneer, lucknow dum biryani, garlic naan.what to drink: you might want to try an imported indian soda like thums up or limca. currently, adda is byob, and there’s a 7-eleven with an abysmal beer selection two doors down to the east.bonus tip: one dessert is usually available, a kheer (rice pudding) snowed with crushed pistachios and cashews attributed to the owner’s father. it is excellent, but so rich that two should share.expertly executed food saves intersect by lexus from feeling like a total corporate shillon a stretch of 14th street where boutique workers on cigarette breaks sometimes seem to outnumber pedestrians, there lies a shiny new restaurant, cafe, and retail space. the first thing a prospective patron sees is a sign advertising a brownie, which is decorated with an edible symbol for lexus, the luxury automaker that encourages humans to gift other humans $75,000 vehicles for christmas.the second thing a diner sees at this venue, which serves the food of gregory marchand, one of the great chefs of paris, is a full-sized suv — an actual lexus. it sits in the lobby of this space operated by union square hospitality group’s danny meyer, a hospitality guru who likes to choose low-key names for his projects. but this restaurant is named after a car company. welcome to intersect by lexus.anyone who orders a bacon maple scone — heady with the scent of sweet pork — will have a fantastic view of a two-story wall of car parts, and a nice view of the car too. one can learn a lot about that automobile here, from an eight-panel museum exhibit in the back to souvenir cards at the cafe tables explaining how the vehicle “adheres to the japanese tradition of omotenashi, or hospitality.” information about marchand is slightly tougher to come by, which is too bad, because this restaurant sponsored by a car company happens to serve the most creatively ambitious food to come out of any meyer restaurant since gramercy tavern or the modern. one of the pleasures of dining at independent restaurants in 2019 is that they feel immune to the corporate takeover of the city, a town where cheap hot dog stands close to make way for chic juice bars. they serve as an escape from the branded experience encroaching upon so many aspects of modern american life: a president who tweets out photos of fast-food buffets; mobile ads tailored so perfectly that people have begun to wonder whether apps are listening in on our conversations.intersect offers no such escape, though the restaurant itself, located on the second floor, is free of any full-size sedans or obvious lexus paraphernalia. marchand — who helped dress down fine dining at frenchie in paris — is guest chef until the end of march. after that, another chef will take over, and then another every four to six months. therein lies what might be the upside to this type of sponsored restaurant. the fact that meyer operates it without the same financial constraints of a traditional venue, as a manager mentioned to me, means it can afford to experiment a bit more.the catalan avant-gardist ferran adrià, who operated el bulli in spain at a loss, famously toyed with the idea of a corporate-backed space. museums and opera houses have historically relied on the patronage of rich benefactors — not just ticket prices — to fund new exhibits and productions. so couldn’t the same work for restaurants if the arrangement encourages risk? if it highlights new or out-of-town talent? in theory, yes.executive chef nickolas martinez; pastry chef kazuo fujimura; foie gras with pastramimarchand — whose vision is executed on a day-to-day basis by executive chef nickolas martinez and pastry chef kazuo fujimura — crafts the type of visually stunning and modern dishes one might expect from a tasting temple charging $600 for two. here, a great meal costs about $200.the kitchen aces buttery rectangles of foie gras with long slices of pastrami, redolent with the scent of clove. smear it on a slice of sourdough, and the result is an open-faced spiced meat sandwich that would make a convert out of even the most devoted patron of katz’s. so many chefs use raw fish to show off skillful knife work — turning raw tuna into geometrically perfect squares or rectangles. marchand and martinez prefer to practice their hammering skills, pounding fluke into a carpaccio that takes up as many square inches as schnitzel. the fish is neutral and translucent; it acts as a clean delivery mechanism for salt, greens, and crispy quinoa.martinez also finds textural correspondence with a bowl of mushrooms, gnocchi, and sweetbreads. every morsel, simultaneously rich yet packed with acid, yields to a soft chew. a giant cross-section of cauliflower sits underneath a crumble of seeds, nuts, and dates. you cut it like a steak and drag the florets through a curried puree of the vegetable. and an (oversized) duck breast flaunts a sesame-honey-glazed skin that seems to shatter like candy when cut; quenelles of sunchoke puree impart a haunting smokiness. as for the desserts, fujimura serves the type of technically advanced yet delicious sweets that wouldn’t feel out of place at a three-michelin-starred spot like le bernardin, where he once worked.he takes banoffee, a dense and caloric british pie, and transforms it into a cloud, piping a dulce de leche foam over banana ice cream and compote. one doesn’t eat it as much as inhale it. and he makes a mont blanc to end all mont blancs. spaghetti-like swirls of chestnut cream surround a base of creme fraiche chantilly — nothing out of the ordinary there. but at the base is a mound of candied chestnut, an unusual addition that adds a warming, chewy savoriness. and on top of the tiny “mountain” is another twist: a dollop of yuzu-yogurt sorbet, cutting through the sweetness. it doesn’t do too much good to go on too long about a menu that will change entirely this spring, but it’s worth musing upon some larger aspects of the space — and the lexus agenda — that bode less well for sponsored culinary establishments.restaurants are many things, but they don’t historically act as lifestyle ambassadors for brands whose products many of their own patrons will never be able to afford. alas, in the past few years, new york has seen blue box cafe, which sells a $32 “breakfast at tiffany” inside the jeweler’s flagship, and la mercerie at roman and williams guild, where hosts advise guests to browse a store selling $16,000 couches.the self-proclaimed purpose of intersect, which also has locations in tokyo and dubai, is to act as a “unique, permanent space in select global cities where people can experience the ethos of the lexus lifestyle without getting behind the steering wheel of one of our cars.” it’s not a mantra that screams “restaurant” or “hospitality.” perhaps this is why everything feels a little different here. bathrooms lie behind two sets of space-age sliding doors; toilets come equipped with heated seats. cool. anyone who uses those restrooms must pass by that suv — not to mention a video installation showing sleepy b-roll of that car. it’s... less cool. and since lexus supports “local and international artisans as they develop their trade,” a retail area sells $350 sunglasses and a reinterpretation of a soccer ball for $410. the main dining room is a window-free affair, accented with off-white bookshelves, light-brown woods, and a generic open kitchen. the space is as removed from the city as an upscale airline concessioner in denver, las vegas, or cincinnati.lexus should find a way to move at least part of the dining room to street level, imparting a sense of vibrancy to a stretch of manhattan that’s often bereft of pedestrians after 8 p.m. instead, all that passers-by see is that cafe space, which can appear as barren as the retail shops nearby. a restaurant should foster a sense of community. the community defined by intersect feels like a sterile world dreamed up by a wealthy baby boomer from the suburbs. it feels built for aging lexus owners, with the sound system piping out billy joel, petula clark, and jackson browne.and that brings up the menu format. marchand is one of the leading members of the french bistronomie movement, which generally favors small plates (or tasting menus) in casual, affordable-ish settings. it’s a movement that helped bring a more personal and accessible approach to ambitious dining to paris, and it paved the way for auteur-esque new york venues like estela or contra.intersect, by contrast, takes the brilliant cooking of marchand but confines it to a clunky three-course menu. it’s as if the pulsating urgency of parisian gastronomy is being retrofitted for a stereotypically fancy restaurant in manhasset, long island.so can a sponsored restaurant work? yes, but the model needs tweaking. intersect claims it wants to be an “immersive cultural experience,” and to “to engage, inspire and stimulate young creators whose ideas will shape our tomorrow,” and that’s great! but for now, the only “programming” listed for cultural experience is the valentine’s day prix fixe, as well as an offer to “meet the vehicle combining high performance with unrestrained luxury.” it’s referring, of course, to the car in the lobby.cost: starters at $18-$22; mains at $27-$46; desserts at $13. bar snacks and plates run $8-$24. all prices are service-included; there is no tipping.sample dishes:  fluke carpaccio with crispy quinoa and beets; foie gras with pastrami; gnocchi with sweetbreads and mushrooms; cauliflower with nuts, seeds, dates, and curry; duck with sesame, sunchoke, salsify, and tatsoi; yuzu mont blanc, tarte tatin with cardamom cream.bonus tip:  the cafe space, during the day, is a much more pleasant space than starbucks reserve roastery to type away on a laptop with a cup of coffee and a pastry. the cafe, unfortunately, is card-only, like the restaurant.critic’s note: this review is presented without stars due to the regular chef changesspa 88 heals the body from outside and within, delivering some of the city’s most satisfying borscht and pelmenimy first piece of advice about the russian banya, or bathhouse, is that the cold dip pool is for cooling off. it is not for swimming. that’s a lesson i learned as a 16-year-old doing laps at a tiny pool in st. petersburg. the water was 38 degrees. i was pretty stupid.my second piece of advice about the banya, a slavic sweat-bathing tradition for over 1,000 years, is that you will eat well there. this is particularly true at spa 88 in fidi, a two decade-old sanitarium where people in bathing suits feast on some of the city’s finest former soviet  union fare. i’ve been schvitzing here for the better part of a decade, a love affair that began because another one ended. briefly: she moved out of my place and into his. and the banya is where i went to recover. it was a place to numb my pain without alcohol, to take an impromptu nap without explanation (try that in a bar), and to have an emotional meltdown without interrupting dinner. the banya is where i went to heal.a patron leaving the schvitz; georgian-style chicken tabaka; another patron preparing for a platza treatment; tea with borschtnotions of convalescence notwithstanding, the russian spa does not traffic in spa food or contemporary wellness fare; there’s no avocado toast or acai bowls. it serves the same salt-of-the-earth preparations that russians, uzbeks, georgians, and ukrainians are famous for anywhere. think: tender lamb shashlik (kebabs), hearty goluptsi (meat-stuffed cabbage), and soft vareniki (steamed dumplings) stuffed with sweet cherries.eating under these conditions isn’t quite like visiting a steakhouse or brasserie. the heat, followed by icy plunges, exhausts the body in a profound way. it induces hunger. feeling the life come back to your almost-numb (or profusely sweating) extremities as you slurp up ukha — clear fish soup with a potent taste of the sea — is a very different sensation than feeling your stomach distend after ingesting yet another slice of ribeye.this is where the banya differs from its american analogues, those piney, wood-paneled rooms at equinox where suburbanites unwind after watching dr. oz for an hour on the elliptical. a fitness-club sauna is blandly calming. a russian sauna is stressful. and while the ultimate result is that you will, at some point during your multi-hour session, become wonderfully relaxed, the process of getting there is a rigorous mental and metabolic affair.spa 88’s narrow entrance, located next to a pawn shop on fulton, belies the expansiveness of this subterranean behemoth. it packs a lap pool, a cigar room, a jacuzzi that’s hogged by non-russian speakers, a juice bar that hawks dried fish, massage rooms, cold rooms, a restaurant, a cafe, and four hot rooms, each of which tax the body with very specific degrees of heat and pain. the infrared sauna (lolz: “bulletproof your immune system”) is the most useless of the three. better to start off with the turkish bath, foggy with crisp eucalyptus steam, before moving on to the old american schvitz, where people dump buckets of water over themselves to prolong the pain. then graduate to the dry russian sauna. here, the temperature is so hot (180 f or higher), it can start to melt a plastic container, releasing its toxins. if you bring in a water bottle, you will be admonished.some patrons slather their faces in honey, which russians historically believe is a natural detoxifier and skin softener. others might hire a man with military-grade forearms to whip them with wet oak branches, resulting in the leaves releasing “organic phytoncides, infection inhibitors, decreasing the growth and development of pathogens in the body,” per the banya. this treatment, known as platza, perfumes the surrounding benches with the scent of a damp forest.on a saturday afternoon, you sit closer to people than you would at a communal table. except here, people don’t have shirts on. here, you sweat. your perspiration starts off as a damp treadmill dew, salutary evaporation to keep your exterior cool. but as the minutes pass, your sweat becomes more viscous, mixing with the skin-softening secretions of your sebaceous glands. it’s as if a light film of olive oil is slicking your entire body.then you jump into the cold plunge. you scream. you warm up in the sauna again. you repeat this process so many times that your nerve endings start to tingle and go numb; it is the epidermal analogue to sichuan-style mala. and then you eat. the sweet musk of kharcho — a spicy georgian lamb soup — is detectable from across the table. the broth is the color of gravy. rice adds starchiness; whole peppercorns add fire. it is hearty without being rich, seasoned without being salty. it lets patrons return to the hot room without burdening the digestive system or blurring the senses. so you go back in and sweat.from top left: the cafe at spa 88; showering after the hot room; heading back into the sauna.the banya serves as a respite from the traditional restaurant dining experience, an enjoyable if restrictive construct where patrons are shunted to a bar until the party is complete, directed to a table for dining, presented a check upon request, and then expected to leave with haste. at the spa, your companions do not need to arrive at the same time as you do, a convenience that holds true at literally any bathhouse, from the century-old east village one, to the sprawling banya in seagate, to the korean spa castle in queens. patrons aren’t pinned to their chairs, either; you can wander around without eight staffers asking whether you need help. and you can stay so long that it’s not unreasonable to have two separate meals during one visit.the banya is the antithesis to the safe two-drink date. it is showing up at balthazar for lunch and leaving after dinner.much of the same could be said of food halls and venues like starbucks reserve roastery, which function as stay-as-long-as-you-want coworking spaces while hawking expensive pour-over coffee and artisanal pastries. but still, the banya is different from those all-day venues in that the gastronomy is even further removed from the equation. this is why dining at the bathhouse recalls dining at baseball games, football games, bowling alleys, municipal pools, arcades, mess halls on ski slopes, or this really weird alligator zoo in florida where they fed me fried gator. the banya reminds me of how i used to eat before i ate for a living, which is to say at places where food was a vital part of a larger activity, not the single religious event around which an entire evening was organized.the banya is a place for a more heterogeneous group of body types than a boutique spin class. it’s a place where, if the finance bros get too loud, you simply throw water on the hot rocks and watch them flee to the upstairs whirlpool bath. the goal of the spa isn’t culinary enlightenment or showing off one’s abs in expensive athleisure. you come to the banya for cleansing, restoring, meditating, and socializing in cheap used swim trunks, which are provided free of charge.my last piece of advice about the banya is to consider the central events in the irony of fate, a soviet screwball comedy from 1975. on new year’s eve, a group of friends get so drunk at a moscow bathhouse that they send the wrong guy on a flight back to leningrad. the poor chap doesn’t realize his predicament until he wakes up 450 miles away from home, in the bed of a woman no less. a love story ensues and there’s biting commentary on drab soviet architecture — dude couldn’t tell which city he was in — but really, the point here is that if you drink at the banya, be careful!so while the infused vodkas might be tempting, i’d say a single beer is about the upward limit of alcohol consumption. if the goal of the spa is to beneficially dehydrate, the goal of the cafeteria is to put fluids back in.this applies to solid nourishment as well. keep things simple, and always order borscht, a soup that’s cloudy and dense with cabbage but with enough tartness to counter the restrained sugars of the beetroot. also consider the khash, armenian beef foot and tripe soup, with a float of scallions and pepperoncini. your lips will stick together from the gelatins.the name of the formal upstairs restaurant, which also services the lower-level banya cafeteria, is matryoshka, the term for the famous russian dolls within a doll that decorate the room. for better results, dine in the cafeteria. you seat yourself on a plastic nautical high-back chair — like the ones they rent on european beaches — and you eat food off a backyard-style glass table.you place an order at the counter, take a few runs into the hot rooms — no need to wait at your table like at a traditional restaurant — and in about 10 to 15 minutes, your meal is ready. perhaps you’ll ask for sweet blini with salty salmon roe; the maritime musk of the red caviar awakens the senses. feeling just a touch more peckish? then order pelmeni, siberian pork dumplings doused in sour cream, or georgian chicken tabaka, poussin that’s been crisped under a brick till crisp and juicy and slathered with garlic.then you take a nap, possibly on a soft couch, but more likely at your table. ten minutes later, you wake up. you take a swing of poland spring water. you realize that maybe this water isn’t yours. you drink some more anyway, and you stride back into the sauna, a little more relaxed, and a little more fortified to face the never-ending cold dip pool that is a new york winter.cost: $50 full-day admission for the bathhouse, though there’s no fee for guests only visiting matryoshka restaurant.\\xa0platza is an extra $40. service is not included.sample dishes: blini with red caviar, kharcho soup, borscht, siberian pelmeni, georgian-style chicken tabaka, lamb shashlik, garlic fried potatoes.bonus tip: leave about three hours or more for a proper visit, or longer if you plan on napping. but pace yourself. go easy on the hot russian sauna and cold dip pool, especially if you’re a first timer. consider wearing a wool hat ($20 at the gift shop) to protect your head from the heat. also, don’t be a creep!\\xa0critic’s note: this column is presented without stars because food is only one part of the larger bathhouse experience.the famous chicago import is indulgent to a fault, and not nearly worth the wait that it commands at its tribeca locationto observe the flattop at au cheval, the new york spinoff of brendan sodikoff’s chicago burger palace, is to witness black steel turn pink. the cooks here do not tend to verdant asparagus or springtime ramps; rather, they traffic in flesh, blood, and marrow. beef patties and pork belly cover the griddle with such density that an intrepid cat could walk across without burning its paws. it is a carpet of meat. an angus rug that sizzles. these burgers are why otherwise rational humans subject themselves to an inordinately long wait before dinner. the tribeca hotspot offers two optional toppings: a fried egg and a layer of pepper bacon — the kind that’s cut so thick it could stand alone as an appetizer. those add-ons are for those who want, to borrow the words of a waiter, “the instagram burger.” i want no such thing. twenty minutes later, my server sends over the standard model: two seared patties. they boast a handsome maillard char and a midlevel bovine punch. american cheese — or as i like to call it, yellow salt — folds itself into the brown nooks and crannies. this all goes into a golden brioche bun slicked with dijonnaise. it is a tasty burger. then again, there is no shortage of tasty burgers in new york. that’s worth keeping in mind when a host says it’s going to be 90 minutes before you sit down.also worth keeping in mind: the signature item runs $27 with fries, placing it firmly within gourmet burger territory. add the suggested toppings and you’re at $35, which places it alongside the db burger as one of the city’s priciest. but while boulud’s truffle- and foie gras-stuffed specimen is a veritable act of expert charcuterie, the au cheval burger, with all the fixins, is a gloppy, runny, everything-falls-out-when-you-bite-it expression of american junk food. it’s not quite in the same league as its peers.back in 2010, when the iphone was still in its infancy, apple sent developers a rather famous set of guidelines. “if your app doesn’t do something useful or provide some form of lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted,” the tech giant wrote, adding, “we don’t need any more fart apps.”the city’s restaurant scene would benefit from a similar set of guidelines. to wit: our new york doesn’t really need any more classic steakhouses or expensive burgers. there’s something positively head-spinning about a well-funded operator looking out over the cityscape and declaring, gosh, new york could really use a few more ribeyes and pat lafrieda blend patties. and yet here’s thomas keller, bestowing manhattan with a carbon copy of his miami chophouse at hudson yards, and there’s sodikoff, giving tribeca a near replica of his windy city spot.the indulgent menu is nearly identical to the original; the only real difference is the digs. the room is smaller in chicago, and the service is efficient. here in new york, the ceilings are high enough and the booths are roomy enough to suggest a grand brasserie or prix fixe spot. sodikoff, who made his new york debut with the ultra-exclusive 4 charles prime rib (good luck getting a reservation before 11:45 p.m.), bills this as a diner. if that truly were the case, it would heed the cue of meme’s or gertie’s, two venues that seek to rethink that dying form with a mix of nostalgia, generosity, and egg creams.sodikoff’s use of the term feels more ironic than honest. is “diner” really the right description for a venue that books up between 5 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.? where a host says “we’ll text you,” rather than invite you to hang out in the downstairs bar? where the lighting is as dim as at a nightclub? where food isn’t delivered as platters with sides, but rather ordered a la carte, as at a steakhouse? in a city where affordability and accessibility feel under assault at every angle, “diner” isn’t a term worth ceding ground on.au cheval’s food — unlike the bright, high-acid fare of the past few years — functions as a throwback to the fatty aughts or a hat tip to chicago’s historic affinity for meat. the single burger comes with two patties and the double comes with three. fried bologna is piled as high as a mini kakigori. vegetarians don’t have much to work with here, save a not quite palate-cleansing green salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, or an omelet stuffed with too much chevre. herbivores can also pretend the fries aren’t crisped in beef fat. one might justify this as bucking trends, or as “transgressive cooking,” as my colleague robert sietsema put it. i’d counter that the prevailing philosophy at au cheval is to ignore accepted principles of good cooking, or of what normal stomachs and bodies can handle. that said, here’s what to order and what to avoid. chilaquiles: traditionally, the dish consists of tortilla chips simmered in salsa. that much is true here, except au cheval stacks everything high and adds sour cream, guacamole, egg, and jalapenos. the chips and toppings are arguably more in conversation with american nachos than the mexican staple, but it doesn’t suffer from the fusion-y sensibilities. the salsa is applied generously enough to offset all the richness.general jane’s fried chicken: a whole bird lacquered up in a honey-soy-ginger glaze. the exterior color recalls the dark, molasses-like hue of pok pok’s fish sauce wings, albeit with a touch less balance or complexity. each bite yields a hefty crunch and tender flesh, with some of the fattier bits giving off a deep, poultry kick. sprigs of cilantro keep the rampant sweetness in check, if only barely.eggs with foie gras: a moat of tawny shallot-sherry gravy spills across mounds of soft yellow curds. this isn’t a study in contrasts, but rather an essay in amplification; the eggs enrich the sauce, while the sauce adds salty, umami oomph to the eggs. the only thing that’s out of place are the knobs of foie gras, which are overcooked and only serve to pump up your bill. the cost is $28.root beer float: this concoction is more of a parfait, with interspersed layers of ice cream and soda. the result is a sundae that’s easier to eat than most floats; diners aren’t tasked with attacking a single globule of frozen dairy bobbing up and down as it melts. the root beer, incidentally, packs an assertive sarsaparilla sucker punch.mille-feuille: pastry cream as thick as cheesecake sits between layers of puff pastry the color of milk chocolate. it is an excellent american tweak to the french classic. the chicken barlocated down a flight of stairs, just before the restrooms, the chicken bar is where to pass an hour or so while you wait for a friday-night table. the red-hued lighting\\xa0is bewildering and blinding at first, but your eyes will adjust (though your phone’s camera will not). here’s how to roll like a pro down here:drink a painkiller. bartenders pour the frozen tiki cocktail into tiny plastic water cups. the soothing, silky mixture of rum, pineapple, orange, and coconut efficiently cleanses the palate of the aggressively seasoned fried chicken. ($14)try a hot chicken sando. the downstairs kitchen fries up three chicken fingers, seasons them with cayenne, ancho, and gochujang, and places them each inside a comically tiny bun. the poultry packs an intense salinity and an impressive crunch, and while the heat level is mild, a dose of crystal hot sauce, available at the bar, should get the job done. ($10)avoid the bacon cheese fries. there’s not much going on here, just a pile of bland fries with underseasoned and underspiced bacon chili and cheese sauce. ($10)fries: the fries at au cheval have received the type of breathless praise that one would expect to see hanging above a broadway marquee. let me be brief here: they are fine. sometimes they are crispy; sometimes they are not. the beef tallow adds no distinctive flavor or aroma.the burger: a perfectly respectable burger, though a touch pricey at $27 with fries (or $18 without). the bacon-and-egg burger provides impressive flavors as well, but it’s a drippy, unstructured mess.hash browns with duck hearts: this isn’t a typical shaved potato hash; au cheval instead uses diced and roasted potatoes. the crispiness factor is more subdued. in any case, cooks slather the nuggets in mornay and duck gravy. this would be a reasonably nourishing dish at a roadside diner in, let’s say, montana, after a long day of skiing and hunting elk. but one might argue such organ-y and carb-y indulgences don’t quite jibe with a hot and humid new york summer.broiled salmon: this is the sole fish option here. the kitchen, rather than letting the fish express its luxuriant oils, sends out a well-done slab of salmon. the menu promises brown butter and black pepper, neither of which are apparent on the product that arrives. the flesh has the texture of well-done tuna fish and comes with a side of what the waiter eagerly describes as “steak salt.” it tastes like any salt.chevre omelet: a classic demilune of scrambled eggs, folded over goat cheese and red bell peppers. this isn’t a bad pairing, per se, but the eggs are infused with such an obscene amount of butter and salt that the palate craves acidity, be it a zingier cheese or tart oven-roasted tomatoes. instead, the chevre adds fat and the pepper adds sugar. it is a study in too much.bologna sandwich: the key to a good fried bologna sandwich is imparting the mortadella with a mid-level char, causing the edges to curl up like roni cups; the crispy bits act as a counterpoint to the meat’s intrinsic sweetness. here at au cheval, however, the sandwich is simply a pile of warm, nutmeg-laced cold cuts on a bun. a slathering of melted cheese and dijonnaise increase the glop factor. a corner deli could do better.cost: excluding the $50 pork porterhouse for two, all dishes are under $30, with many items falling below $20. a standard burger meal, however, can quickly get pricey. the signature item is $18 by itself, $23 with bacon, $26 with a fried egg, and $35 with all of the above, plus fries ($9). add on two drinks and you’re at nearly $90 for one after tax and tip.sample dishes: green salad with pickled shallot, kale caesar, foie gras with scrambled eggs and toast, fried bologna sandwich, chilaquiles, classic burger, mille-feuille, root beer float.bonus tip: tables are released on resy a week out and get snapped up quickly. walk-ins during the off hours can face no waits; during prime time, waits can creep up past 90 minutes. also: consider swinging by just for coffee, be it a pourover or a “military latte” (a creation that’s dusted with matcha and cocoa powder) at the sawada stand inside.at costas spiliadis’s greek seafood restaurant at hudson yards, the one constant is that you’ll feel cheated — whether the food is grand or averageat the sprawling hudson yards location of milos, the costas spiliadis seafood chain that treats diners as if they were marks at a pickpockets convention, no event is more pivotal to the nightly con than the tour. a server approaches your table and invites you to browse a selection of seafood. the options look immaculate. small mountains of ice hold a seafaring selection not often seen in new york: emperor fish, with anime eyes and a millenial-pink sheen. carabinero shrimp, as unnaturally red as a coca-cola can. rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest jurassic park film. this is where you choose your dinner — a process that occurs, almost universally, after you’ve plowed through half a pomegranate daiquiri. it’s the maritime equivalent of shopping for engagement rings with a glass of bubbly. you almost don’t notice when a waiter recommends you kick off the meal with langoustines that runs $102 per pound. besides, there’s no way he’ll give you anything close to a pound. right?make no mistake: you have been primed for a shakedown, cartier-style. one of the holy grails of modern fine dining has been finding a way to de-emphasize the transactional experience of a meal. the culinary arts have always been uniquely handicapped in this sense. opera would have a different feel if a soprano kicked off the evening by telling spectators “this aria is going to cost you a ton,” and then sent out a check to everyone at the end of the night.some of america’s most expensive restaurants have solved this problem via a ticketing system, having guests pay for meals in advance. milos takes a different tack, obscuring as many prices as possible throughout the course of an evening. the saga starts back at that tour. the captains sing nuanced praises for the barbounia, fagi, and lavraki. they know which ones are oily, which ones are buttery, and that there’s “not much cheek meat in the turbot.” they know every detail — except for the prices, a subject they avoid so diligently that one wonders whether these veritable ichthyologists skipped a very specific day of school.by-the-pound prices are posted above most fish. that price, though, means you’re looking not at the actual cost but the raw data for an incomplete math equation. either way, you’re paying more attention to the waiter’s musings on the milos yacht (which you can apparently rent in the aegean sea), or how a two-and-a-half-pound lobster would be nice for a solo diner. the lobsters bear no price tags, which is dangerous for a main that costs more than round-trip airfare to chicago.you return to your linen-clad table and ask for two langoustines and a turbot. the server says the whole fish is three pounds. you know the price is $56 per pound — you were smart enough to take notes — so you figure you’ll be out $160. and yet, when the bill comes, the price is $197. that can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil. then you take a closer look at the check and notice the fish is half a pound heavier than the waiter told you it would be. whoops!those langoustines, in turn, boast a sweet, gas-grilled aroma, though they lack the intense, oceanic aroma these crustaceans have elsewhere. you didn’t inquire about the price, because you got tired of asking “how much do these actually cost?” you figured a few prawns would cost less than caviar service. you figured wrong. they’re a cool $87 for an appetizer’s worth of meat. this is when you start to spew expletives. the well-heeled might find this system unobtrusive, and perhaps there’s something honest about assigning a very specific price to an individual fish based on its weight. there’s also a certain elegance in convincing guests to part with a few extra dollars and make them feel like it was worth it. but everyday gourmands might find something disingenuous about implementing that system in such a way that dinner ends up costing you $100 more than you budgeted for. constant incongruities on a bill at milos feel more like the work of an unscrupulous bookie than an honest act of hospitality. the food, too, does not always deliver on unexpectedly ballooned costs. the carabinero prawns — a receptionist told me i’d pay $30 apiece; the bill charged $40 — tasted like shellfish to the power of 10, but a lobster pasta in which diced tail meat gets tossed into a sherry cream sauce did little better than neighborhood restaurants that charge almost four times less. with two medium-sized claws, the middling dish arrived on the bill at $189. instead, order the soft-shell crab. at $27 apiece, they’re a heck of a price, but the cooks do them right, pan-frying them in a way that seems to preserve their briny juices better than elsewhere. the best way to hit milos, though, is to sit at the bar, order a pound of the rarely-seen-in-nyc fried red mullets, and tear away at the small fish with a buddy. the impossibly sweet flesh, when it’s not overcooked, recalls the fragrant, mineral aromas of the mediterranean.that’s the thing about milos. you can have a reasonably grand meal here. you can have a reasonably average meal here. and yet the one constant is that on every visit, you feel cheated.walnut cake with ice cream, goat’s milk yogurt with thyme honey, greek ceviche, and other dishes from estiatorio milosspiliadis has been at this for a while now. he opened his first milos in montreal in 1979, followed that up with a midtown manhattan location in 1997, and replicated those efforts in london, vegas, and seattle. if nothing else, his new york stalwart deserves credit for occupying a very specific role in the fine dining community; the city’s most expensive restaurants have long focused on manipulating, refining, and saucing food, while milos has always been the ultimate pure product emporium, minimally adorning fish and serving them grilled, pan-fried, or salt-baked. if done right, like it is at bartolotta in las vegas, this style of dining can be quite wonderful. at hudson yards, it feels more like an ode to long island dining. that is to say: you can pay a lot of money for a lot of forgettable food while hanging with a bunch of middle-aged guys in leather jackets jockeying for the bartender’s attention.this isn’t exactly danny meyer generosity or ambience, either. hosts don’t say goodbye. the guy who pours you a drink won’t transfer your tab. and the ambience evokes a cheap cruise with obstructed views; the lighting is so poor that the panoramic windows do a better job at reflecting back the dining room than providing a view of the hudson.i suppose i could have devoted an equally long essay to service issues — to the fact that one can eat the bulk of that lobster without a wine or cocktail, because you couldn’t flag down a waiter. to the fact that you can go 60 minutes after arriving without food because the restaurant is overbooked and the waiters ignore you after you’re seated. to the fact that you might get a table overlooking the mall. thing is, we’re all familiar with these stories; stereotypically bad restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city. i highlight the opaque pricing because an unsuspecting diner could really get taken here. and that is what makes milos a uniquely bad restaurant. cost: anywhere from $150-$250 per person for a full 3-4 course meal. for a more affordable experience, consider the $32 business lunch, or the $57 family weekend lunch. remember that most fish and shellfish are listed as mp.sample dishes: carabinero prawns, fried red mullet, langoustines, charred octopus, stone crab claws (seasonal), maryland crab cake, greek ceviche with feta, assorted grilled fish, galaktoboureko\\xa0(lemon custard in phyllo), baklava.bonus tip: waiters sometimes offer to weigh a fish, but will rarely tell you the resulting price. to stay under budget, ask what the total “weighed” portion of your order will cost.cédric vongerichten’s first restaurant without his famous father is an indonesian stunner in nolitaat the chef’s counter at wayan, cédric and ochi vongerichten’s stunner of an indonesian restaurant, a waiter pours a glass of champagne as cooks tend to sizzling satays. skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. but from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. the chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. this is unexpected. indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to dutch to middle eastern to indian to polynesian to chinese. but broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. it’s a style of cooking new york restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at nargis. and yet at wayan in nolita, due to fire code issues, the team executes this southeast asian staple via a european-style griddle. the skewers do not suffer from the adaptation. if chicken satays sound boring, consider this: the thigh meat exhibits the silkiness of tofu, while a beige peanut sauce flaunts the richness of cream. it’s like blanquette de veau on a stick, albeit energized with coconut and red curry. pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. and sticks of florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ochi, a jakarta native involved in everything from menu development to tableware, and her chef-husband cédric, have given new york a thrilling addition to its contemporary southeast asian scene. like uncle boons, kopitiam, jeepney, and elsewhere, wayan shows off compelling strains of modernity rooted in tradition.alongside a cilantro-scented filet of steamed bass, the delicate flesh just firmer than custard, a waiter places a single bakwan jagung, a classic corn fritter plated for the social media era. cédric garnishes the creation with scallions and sits it on a tiny pedestal; the flavor is pure fried chicken skin while the visuals are very el bulli.a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, this is the type of restaurant one might have expected from cédric’s father, jean-georges vongerichten, the franco-american chef who shook up new york gastronomy in the late ’90s and early aughts. from his eponymous central park flagship to his clubby spice market in the meatpacking district, he drew upon his days cooking in thailand, singapore, and hong kong to fuse asian sensibilities with continental fare. he flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier midtown venues. the flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.that style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at wayan. cédric, a bangkok-born chef who also runs perry st, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. you roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.particularly breathtaking is sop buntut, javanese oxtail soup. the broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. on the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. fancy french chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. and that’s precisely what cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm maillard char.really, if there were any fears about whether wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the new york restaurant world. the prevailing jean-georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland east-meets-west menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. such fears are not entirely unwarranted. vong kitchen in jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” cédric and jean-georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the wayan menu. there’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any nobu or robuchon in moscow or tokyo. there’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. and then there’s wayan’s crabcake, garnished with a vertical build of cucumbers and sprouts as if it were one of alfred portale’s “tall” dishes from the 1980s. with so many brilliant southeast asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the american country club variety. make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. but still, it’s disappointing that cédric, instead of trying to introduce new yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. the name wayan, incidentally, is balinese; it means first-born. the tao-ish design (rockwell group) is a hat tip to that island as well, with reclaimed wood and hanging vines evoking its vernacular architecture. the decorative spices strewn throughout the restaurant, from cinnamon to star anise, by contrast, feel like an ode to pottery barn.more inspirational is the nasi goreng, a must-order. indonesian meals are often built around rice, and wayan’s version of the staple is deeply flavorful with the aroma of garlic. pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk. or for an equally complex starch, the kitchen slicks chinese-style lamian noodles with kecap manis, a molasses-like soy sauce, as well with a throat-tickling blend of chiles and black peppercorns. for good measure, they also throw in a few chunks of lobster so powerfully flavored one wonders if cédric found a way to dry-age the crustacean.the dessert of choice is pandan custard, as much a visual triumph as a gustatory one. cédric pours a layer of passionfruit juice, along with its seeds, along the top layer of the confection. you dip in your spoon as if you were digging into a halved tropical fruit, but what comes out is not yellow flesh but rather oozy, vanilla-laced pudding. the juice acts as an assertive, acidic counterpoint to the indulgent dairy. jean-georges also does a bit of trompe l’oeil over on central park west, where caviar sits atop what appears to be a lemon — it’s really just citron gelee. like father, like son, i suppose, but i’ll cast my vote for the cheaper $12 faux fruit! cost: satays at $12-$15; small plates at $12-$19; mains at $24-$29, with one exception: steak is $59. expect to spend about $100 per person for a fully-loaded meal with two drinks each after tax and tip.sample dishes: chicken, pork, and shrimp satays, hearts of palm with mango and passionfruit, javanese oxtail soup, indonesian corn fritter, nasi goreng, yellow chicken with coconut milk, steamed black bass with cilantro, baby back pork ribs with tamarind glaze (not too sweet; very well balanced!), pandan custard.desi tacos and cumin-laced guacamole are executed well at the clubby restaurant, but service issues hold back the former indian accent chefhere’s the scene on a recent night at gupshup, a hip new indian restaurant that has attracted the likes of actor anupam kher and comedian jimmy fallon. bollywood movies show at the upstairs bar while thumping club music — not so much the dancing kind as the anonymous variety familiar from a duty-free cosmetics store — fills the dining room. a large group of elite yelpers, distinguished by their very cool nametags, are mingling, swirling red wine, and hovering too close to our table. my party has been waiting for the first course to show up, but when a server finally swings by, she brings something a bit less expected: a beverage bill from the downstairs bar. “it would be great if you could settle up,” she says. how welcoming.ten minutes later, a waiter ferries over a tray filled with guacamole, tacos, ramen, and other fusiony fare that wouldn’t feel out of place at a clubstaurant like tao or vandal. that reality extends to the cocktail list. anyone who orders the house mule, a watery mix of grey goose, turmeric, ginger, and lavender, will have to ask for an “ayurvedic jackass.” it’s all enough to make one wonder: is it not odd that chef gurpreet singh, whose eye for nuance made indian accent one of the city’s more exhilarating fine dining experiences, is channeling the ubiquities (and ignominies) of the modern food world? it is odd — until you start eating.guacamole, at first glance, is indistinguishable from other excellent versions elsewhere. cooks mash the avocados to order with green chiles and cilantro — nothing out of the ordinary. but a few subtle tweaks make the dish stand out. cooks lace the fruit with cumin; its sweet musk wafts along the palate. and instead of fried tortillas, gupshup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from gujarat. and while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. it’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.for “tacos,” singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. the soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. it conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. you continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of gramercy.the dining room and the jackfruit tacosthere are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of indian fare in new york. one of them, which includes venues like chintan pandya’s adda and hemant mathur’s sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). these venues function to remind new yorkers that south asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of south asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. one thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of rahi in greenwich village or the foie gras duck haleem of baar baar, a frenetic bowery space with a buddakan-style vibe.gupshup, by indian-born restaurateur jimmy rizvi (korali estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. it finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist karishma naran’s mural of a modern indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.that means saturday morning avocado toast. the line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether singh adds anything to the conversation. the chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. it would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. gupshup’s ramen is another misstep. that’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. it’s the execution that’s flawed. the ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.those mistakes aside, singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. there’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. but just as momofuku bang bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, gupshup’s own evocation, blending indian sensibilities with jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. the puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. the tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of alka seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in delhi. vendors typically finish it off with butter. singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. but somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. if the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. singh, in short, is taking advantage of new york’s thriving globalism to riff on his ancestral cuisine. and if any of this seems a touch off, kindly remember that gupshup is simply deploying the same whimsical eclecticism as its non-indian peers, from the american restaurant serving southeast asian shrimp toast to the spanish-leaning seafood spot selling sichuan-style pig ear to virtually any sports bar anywhere in the city hawking tacos.singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. the kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. here at gupshup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. it uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of new york restaurants. maybe that will change after more folks try gupshup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. nizams haleem, a staple of ramadan iftar dinners in hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. the humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. it came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. maybe gupshup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? weird things tend to happen here. the host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. when someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” the complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.pre-made desserts, however, are still available if the pastry chef is absent, though it’s not clear whether that’s a good thing. fig and banana sticky pudding is a study in bland flavors and cold, mealy textures. cinnamon panna cotta, on two occasions, tastes like what would happen if a kitchen worker thought that the traditional italian dessert was supposed to flaunt the texture and sweetness of grocery-store cake frosting. for a gramercy park restaurant with operators as experienced as this, one could reasonably expect more polish; the service missteps tend to distract from the food. and that’s too bad, because singh’s cuisine represents a thrilling chapter in modern new york indian cuisine.cost: starters at $10 to $24; larger dishes at $24 to $46; desserts at $10. ramen appetizer is $16, or $34 with a lobster tail. naan is $5-$7; cocktails are $16; chai is $15.sample dishes: guacamole with khakra crisps, tomato rasam ramen, smoked salmon puchkas, pulled jackfruit “desi tacos,” chicken tikka, kerala beef fry, tiger prawns.bonus tip: if you don’t ask a server to course things out, literally all of your food will show up at once; this is even true for solo diners ordering multiple plates.electric lemon’s airy menu dubiously self-identifies as “clean cuisine,” but the stephen starr restaurant at hudson yards manages to impress anywayelectric lemon is a very good restaurant designed to attract a clientele of fitfluencers, or at least those who dream to be. it claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, pop rocks. the venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. this is, to be fair, all what one might expect at hudson yards’s equinox hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.a lobby host asks if you’re checking in. maybe you are — if you’ve got $2,000 to spend on two nights. most folks will instead take an elevator to the 24th floor. there, among the normals, scores of people who look like cutouts from men’s health are brunching. arms bulge through artisanal sweatshirts. lean torsos jut up like slender tree trunks through drawstring hoodies. a guy in a patagonia-style vest wears airpods throughout his entire meal, even while complaining about his eggs. the kitchen stuffs squishy breakfast sandwiches with heady chicken sausage and pairs them with side salads instead of home fries. christ. a pre-shift manual for waiters, left near a window, offers a primer on carrot juice (“cancer preventer”) and beets (“creates a sense of well-being”), as well as a list of vips staying at the hotel. among them: dolph lundgren and some tech vp.things seem dire until the apple cider doughnuts arrive. they’re rare yeast versions of the autumnal treat, normally made in the cake variety at farmers markets. they shimmer from a light glaze, smelling of cinnamon and wet earth. their texture is bouncy and their flavor is only faintly sweet. herein lies the surprise of electric lemon. those who look past the goop-y branding and weekend djs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. at least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise mid-atlantic fare. and the venue, by mega-restaurateur stephen starr — who runs some of the city’s finest french restaurants, and buddakan — has one hell of a view.the dining room at electric lemon overlooks hudson yards.it is difficult to consider hudson yards without understanding its larger missteps, particularly the fact that the entire compound functions as a taxpayer-subsidized bastion for the rich. but one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the vessel. electric lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the bank of america building, the new yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the hudson river, and the sun setting over the jersey city heights. here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. chef kyle knall (maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. as the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. this is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. a touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. for more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.but for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. but he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. the flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. it all makes for stellar diy tacos.if the the beet-yogurt “beauty bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the new american style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. for example: knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. it’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. it’s curious how, at electric lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in hudson yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots. also: when a restaurant posts a photo of someone holding a cocktail while their cephalic vein bursts out of their forearm, that effectively signals the type of bodies that belong here, and those that don’t.whatever the case, kelly nam’s spectacular desserts more closely adhere to the ethos of french pastry and american junk food than any diet regimen. when a server sets down one of the desserts, he points out that you can “hear” the pop rocks fizzle and hiss. how bucolic. nam laces the candy into orbs of pale green lemon verbena sorbet. next to them, she places frozen spheres of lemon curd. she arranges this all in such a way that channels a faraway solar system, where the orbital bodies are made of sugar and colored in pastels. the sorbet is soft and fragrant; the curd is firm and bracingly sour; and the pop rocks, more audible than visible, vibrate across the tongue like a soft electric current. “moon rock” exhibits no fewer complexities. the chef showers a soft ball of chocolate in dense, black sesame feuilletine and honeycomb crisps, resulting in an amorphous mass that tastes like a cross between a butterfinger and a reese’s peanut butter cup. and since any nut butter calls for dairy, a quenelle of goat’s milk ice cream helps unstick the palate with a kick of barnyard funk. nam’s ideas and executions hint at the type of creative modernism max boonthanakit conjures at nightshade in los angeles, and the technical wizardry that stephanie prida produces at the pool or the lobster club. this is just as true of her frozen yogurt, indented like a thanksgiving gravy boat to hold a pool of verdant juiced herbs. it is a striking sweet-sour contrast in green and white.hudson yards and all its deep flaws aren’t going aways. some folks, justifiably, won’t be able to get past the fact that equinox is owned by related, whose chairman held a high profile fundraiser for president donald trump earlier this year. that aside, electric lemon is a rare place where you can feel that new york magic up high — as long as one ignores the wellness nonsense.cost: starters $12-$24; mains $24-44; desserts $10-$12. expect to spend about $100 or so per person for three courses each plus drinks, tax, and tip.sample dishes: apple cider doughnuts, chia bowl with brazil nuts, razor clams with pickled carrots and cilantro, green tomato carpaccio, roasted lamb with braised breast, grilled bass with fresh herbs and tortillas, lemon curd with lemon verbena sorbet, moon rock with goat’s milk gelato, frozen yogurt with juiced herbs.bonus tip: bar seating typically doesn’t require too much of a wait, if any, if the dining room has no availability. a dj plays near the bar on weekends, but the volume levels are about on par with a normal, crowded restaurant.sign up for our newsletter.noda and sushi noz both execute a pristine, high-end omakase in spite of a clientele that seems insistent on interrupting the zen experienceone of the modern truths of new york gastronomy is that eating expensive sushi means witnessing the wealthy carry out their extravagant existences. at masa, i watched a party of four wolf down $700 worth of wagyu in a minute. “you’ll be able to pay for a year’s worth of flights with the points from this meal,” one of them said to the man stuck with the check. at ichimura, i saw a group of tourists ignore the fragile nigiri the chef was serving them, letting two or more pieces collect on their plates as they tapped away on their phones. and at zo, two guys sitting nearby insisted on taking care of our $650 bill. after they did (thank you!), they encouraged us to defraud our company by expensing the dinner anyway. it’s with these absurdities in mind that one considers noda in flatiron and noz on the upper east side. both rank among the city’s buzziest and most excellent new sushi joints. both tout traditional edomae services, serving aged raw fish over warm rice, one piece at a time, brushed with little more than nikiri (reduced soy) or maybe a quick grate of yuzu zest. like some of their peers, both traffic in deliciously predictable, flown-in-from-japan luxuries, heaping on piles of depleted bluefin as if this were some kind of all-you-can-eat buffet for endangered-species.and at either venue, you’re liable to encounter an increasingly ubiquitous modern character, satirized on billions. i dub him the sushi bro. he does very well for himself. he’ll tell you about every sushi spot he’s ever dined at. and since you’re all stuck at the same counter, he is having dinner with you, whether you like it or not. from top: chef shigeyuki tsunoda standing behind the sushi bar; a bartender pouring a cocktail; and uni and tofu chawanmushi with caviarshortly after he kicked off his omakase at noda last week, a man in a gray suit emitted a subtle “wow” as he ate his silky chawanmushi with uni and caviar. it’s possible i did the same. the white pudding was stunning, enrobing the tongue with its fats and softening the briny blow of the urchin. a few minutes later, as i was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “wow, they nailed that.” he went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television. thing is, we weren’t at the espn zone. we were at a restaurant where two hours of (mostly) spectacular sushi runs $340 after tip. at this tight chef’s counter, lilliputian portions of fish can require closed eyes and mental zen to appreciate their subtleties. as i placed a single bite of o-toro nigiri, a plump slice of fat-oozing tuna belly, into my mouth, my seatmate leaned over and said, “isn’t that great?” and my concentration was broken. this isn’t the first time i’ve seen this type of bro-ish behavior at a sushi bar, nor will it be the last. no other dinner format so reliably packs as many rich type-a folks behind a well-sanded bar and pours them $30 glasses of sake. and no other exorbitant dinner format has grown with the frenzy of sushi since the economic recovery began a decade ago. over the past five years, new york has seen the debut of at least 10 $300-plus omakase spots, easily outpacing the openings of western-leaning tasting-menu venues or rococo chophouses. they rank among the power restaurants of choice in 2019, due in no small part to the fact that they convey luxury more quickly than a gallic tasting, more nimbly than a gut-busting bastion of beef, and often more discreetly than anywhere, thanks to tiny, windowless spaces.that element of mystery abides at noda. its owners include justin hauser, who used to work for related, the firm behind hudson yards, and david hess, whose family founded the namesake multibillion-dollar energy corporation. (the duo also run the fast-casual bondi sushi next door, where lunch costs less a cocktail at noda.)patrons enter by walking into an anonymous office building, past an unmarked door, and into a purple-hued lounge, a posh holding pen that designer ken fulk, using the backwards tropes of orientalism, once described as a “james bond opium den.” a host pulls back a curtain and escorts everyone to the semi-circular bar, flanked by 10 pink velvet stools. the space more closely recalls an avant-garde cocktail parlor than a traditional sushi spot. tsunoda, late of tokyo’s sushi iwa, stands behind the counter, wielding a foot-long knife. he and his team cut knobs of sweet potato into little squares, to pair with earthy lotus root soup. he slices abalone as if it were quartz, letting the jagged edges marinate in a pool of its own juices; the umami-packed one-biter tastes like a brilliant cross between chicken liver and anchovy water. and then comes the nigiri sushi, distinguished by its otherworldly rice. once upon a time, nigiri constituted a quick form of preservation. vinegar, accordingly, is common at any given sushi spot. what sets noda apart is a more aggressive seasoning level; the tart rice zings the tongue like one of those high-acid salads at wildair.that vinegar adds a touch of punch to golden eye snapper or yellowtail, two cuts that turn out a bit mushy. it also helps tame the musk of hokkaido uni, whose tidal aroma lingers for a full minute after consumption. and it adds a dose of balance to exceedingly fatty bluefin. the chef slices this breed thicker than others. it doesn’t so much melt as bounce with a supple springiness. but when the fishy oils start to overwhelm, the acid kicks in to lend a proper dose of pucker. if only the nigiri courses included a wider variety of fish. and if only my enjoyment of the o-toro wasn’t interrupted by bro-man next to me. yeah, that sounds nitpicky, but think of it this way: a diner gets about 23 bites of steak with a rib-eye, but just a single two-inch bite of any particular fish at a sushi spot. it’s as if someone tried to chat with you during the key plot twist of jordan peele’s us at the movies. you don’t get to hit rewind. then again, that moment faded a bit when tsunoda sliced a single bite of tamago. the yellow rectangle dissolved into a pool of custard when consumed, giving off the seafaring scent of gray shrimp. all of a sudden i couldn’t hear anything else around me.if noda has the air of a dinner party, letting cordial cocktail conversations carry over into the sushi bar, the omakase at sushi noz, owned by brothers david and joshua foulquier, channels a more formal ballet. the restaurant’s website likens the restaurant to a kyoto temple, though the chef has also compared his nightly meals, which start at $325, to kabuki theater. it is performance before a rapt audience. it is meant to be transportive; the restaurant imported over 1,000 pieces of wood from japan, including the 200-year-old hinoki wood counter. servers wear full kimonos with slippers.each of the eight patrons remains silent as the chef, a native of hokkaido, greets every diner with a bow. when he starts to prep — lacing his rice with pungent vinegar, grilling eel over coal and bamboo leaves, or dismembering a live king crab while it’s staring at you — the level of diner chatter rarely rises above a whisper.from upper left: chef nozomu abe presenting a king crab, searing bluefin cheek, and brushing a slice of fatty tuna sushi with a soy reductionthe gently poached crab, almost as light as cotton candy, is spectacular, faintly oceanic at the edges and uniformly sweet within. and for those who think crab is too sugary by itself, anchovy dipping sauce with shiso flowers infuses the meat with the brine of 10 waves. abe then walks past the diners with a few slices of bonito under a cloudy glass dome. he decloches the platter (ta-da!), filling the room with the scent of smoked hay. the fish itself sports the fragile density of jell-o, with its skin disintegrating like burnt marshmallow.noz also offers a $175 nigiri-only experience in the separate “ash room.” the mood here is more lively; during a recent visit patrons chatted about flipping homes and drinking grand-cru burgundies — while ribbing me for ordering a beer.chef junichi matsuzaki produces sushi on par with the more expensive hinoki room. last week, the offerings were slightly less tuna-heavy than next door; they included baby sea bream (tender and glimmering), striped jack (sporting a firm snap), pacific oyster (marinated until it has no flavor), and a rice hand roll laced with anchovy yolk sauce (ultra-crisp and obscenely rich).diners can request extra a la carte nigiri here, though four pieces, served over three minutes added $65 to my bill. for those who don’t mind skipping noz’s excellent composed plates, the ash room functions as a fine economy comfort experience.sushi chefs sometimes like to sate the diner immediately with fat, beginning with a slice of tuna. abe instead commenced the nigiri course with humble squid. he doesn’t cross-hatch it like some, or jazz it up with citrus like others. he simply presents it as a slick study in the color white — wearing an invisible cloak of sweet soy. the cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an msg-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess. the rice, while still distinctly tangy, is a touch less vinegared than at noda. it is more “one” with the fish, rather than distinct.as at noda, though, the meal overall was technically masterful but left me craving more textural revelations, more varieties of seafood. dinner quickly devolves into the four bluefin of the apocalypse: marinated akami (nearly dissolves on the tongue), medium fatty chu-toro (luscious and chewy), fatty o-toro (i’ll let you guess what happened), and charcoal-singed cheek (overcooked and bland).sustainability issues notwithstanding, there’s something depressingly uniform about having to make one’s way through the same four slices of tuna — or five, if you count the inevitable toro hand roll — at a fancy omakase spot, sometimes taking up nearly half the nigiri portion of the meal. that’s not to be disrespectful of the craft; part of the bliss of sushi is akin to the joy of watching shakespeare, seeing the same stories tweaked ever so gently by different directors. but to continue the metaphor: shakespeare wrote a lot of plays, and abe and tsunoda — and some of their peers — seem to follow this one particular bluefin script just a little too closely. these practices recall the modern crutch of a western tasting-menu venue, where so many meals finish with that same hunk of wagyu.still, i’ll enjoy my o-toro. or i’ll try. as i’m halfway into my single bite at noz, the guy next to me — it’s always a guy — decided to ask me “why i eat sushi like that,” as if i could, mid-chew, impart him with some sort of cultural wisdom about how i use my hands to place a piece of food into my mouth. i’d tell you what he was referring to, but that would give credence to a sentient blue blazer watching the way i eat and then interrupting me. alas, this is sushi in new york.cost: dinner is $285, or $342 after 20 percent tip. dinners are fully prepaid via the tock reservations service, and they are nonrefundable. optional sake pairings run $205. three a la carte drinks will easily cost $90 or so after tip.sample dishes: chawanmushi with caviar, grilled scallop wrapped in nori, abalone in its own juices, tamago with gray shrimp, and assorted sushi, including kinmedai, sweet shrimp, lean tuna, medium-fatty tuna, and seared tuna.bonus tip: cocktail buffs can visit the bar without committing to the full omakase.cost: $325 in the hinoki room, or $175 in the ash room for a shorter sushi-only menu. all prices are service-included; there is no additional line for tipping.sample dishes: king crab with anchovy sauce and shiso flowers, grilled and smoked bonito, sea perch with rice, and assorted sushi, including squid, wild yellowtail, pike mackerel, all the grades of tuna, and sea eel. dessert might include super-earthy black sesame pudding.bonus tip: reservations can book up a few weeks out on tock, but unlike with noda, patrons can give up their seats a few days ahead of dinner with no financial penalty; this allows for frequent same-week cancellations and availability. ash room seats are often easier to come by.zhen wei fang and tang hotpot are powered by flashy decor, a robust suite of meats, and complex, flavorful brothsthe most useful thing to know about vandal, a bacchanalian bowery temple to viral foods, faux street art, and a basic cocaine lifestyle, is that it’s adjacent to another let’s-have-a-long-night-out spot that’s actually worth visiting. zhen wei fang, backed by wei chen and the congee village team, pairs its pristine hot pot fare with an absolutely wild environment. a robot host greets guests in mandarin. mixed martial arts matches play on four televisions. michael jackson pumps through the sound system. multitiered meat trays rise 3 feet above every table, flaunting vertical croppings of raw lamb, beef, and tofu skin. diners use chopsticks to plunge red ribbons of new zealand lamb ($15) into white bone broth, turning the flesh brown, soft, and succulent. you slurp the meat almost as easily as you would a noodle. want to combine hot pot with a few hours of sake-fueled karaoke? there are private rooms for that. there are also semi-private rooms that double as immersive multimedia carousels. high-tech projectors broadcast computer-generated nature footage on three separate walls, giving patrons the sensation that they’re dining inside an imax universe inspired by 1990s screensavers. leaves fall over ersatz mountains; palm trees sway in the digital wind. as a waiter sears expensive wagyu over a hot stone, snow falls upward toward outer space. the title song to free willy plays on the speakers, and you let silken a5 wagyu, slathered in pork fat and sichuan chiles, dissolve on your tongue for $80.what a new york story: in the literal shadow of one of the city’s most irrationally packed culinary establishments is a hangout that’s killing it — a little more quietly, and with a lot more heart. and in case anyone’s worried zhen wei’s visual antics might compete with the gustatory bliss, there’s another place called tang down the block hawking high-end hot pot fare in a more sedate environment.the back dining room at zhen wei fang.once upon a time, a hot pot spot in vegas was the country’s most expensive restaurant. the chef was masa takayama (yes, that guy), who served a $500 omakase of shabu shabu, the japanese adaptation of the chinese tradition. it didn’t last, but new york has a solid representation of that elevated style at macoron, where a celebrated hot pot tasting runs $128. chinese hot pots, by contrast, a pan-regional tradition with roots in the han dynasty, haven’t reached those levels of extravagance in the big apple. high-end sinosphere fare isn’t nonexistent — one thinks of the $150-plus fish-maw platters at oriental garden or the black-truffle luxuries of hakkasan — but such venues haven’t yet reached the critical mass of expensive french, japanese, or italian venues.local hot pot cuisine in particular remains an affordable affair, ranking with korean barbecue and american smokehouses as some of the most accessible and vital big apple restaurants for groups. some, like hou yi in the east village, draw in budget diners with $31 all-you-can-eat affairs and self-serve ice cream bars. others, like mister hotpot in sunset park, aim for a late-night crowd, hawking reasonably priced meats until 2 a.m.what sets apart zhen wei, and the sichuan-leaning tang down the block (more on that below), is that they’re modernizing the manhattan hot pot experience a bit more pronouncedly than their excellent peers. it’s all in a similar vein to the efforts of other ambitious operators from the mainland and taiwan, which is to say they’re updating and repackaging their ancestral fare for a booming chinese student population — and anyone else willing to spend a few extra dollars at more fashionably contemporary restaurants.that roughly means patrons at both venues will encounter, to a greater or lesser extent, posh interior designs, performative sourcing, bespoke cocktail lists (ugh), craft beers, orange wines, exorbitant wagyu and abalone, and, at tang, a lighting scheme so instagrammable that the museum of modern art would be jealous. if any of these touches make it feel like a beloved tradition is adopting the moneyed signifiers of obnoxiously hip restaurants, rest assured: both venues manage to keep their souls — counterbalancing stereotypical indulgences with classically chinese organ meats and powerfully fragrant broths.the communal experience is a central element of a hot pot meal; one imagines a hungry crew huddled over a single steaming pot. dinner at zhen wei, however, is more uncommonly individualistic.each patron selects their own $6 broth, which simmers on a personal induction burner. it’s tempting to assert there’s something inherently ridiculous about such a setup; one wouldn’t expect a single order of fondue to come in three separate crocks for sanitary reasons. but i’d retort that the courtesy is entirely less absurd than so many other elements of upscale dining, from the use of four plates underneath a single starter at per se to the use of eight different wine glasses during a tasting-menu beverage pairing. or, more practically: it’s fun to try out different broths at zhen wei by dipping into your neighbors’ pots. it’s the soup version of share plates.most options work well with everything, though the spicy sichuan gives a nice kick to neutral items like soft tofu, gorgeously gummy mung bean noodles (take them out when they turn translucent), slippery tendon (as weightless as shaved bonito), and feathery enoki mushrooms. the intensely porky tang of bone broth, in turn, imparts a savory, swine-y aroma to flaky red snapper and firm sea scallops. and sweet and sour tomato, packed with electric acidity and umami, helps tame the gentle funk of lamb or tripe.every broth boasts a voluptuous roundness that makes them sippable on their own; they’re even better poured into small wooden bowls for ramen-noodle dipping. and although the patrons do much of the cooking here, those stellar soups, intensely funky xo ramekins, and all the prepared items are the fine work of chef wei huang, a guangdong native and pan-regional virtuoso who helmed zhen wei’s first location in miami.the chef grills cumin lamb skewers in the style of a studied xinjiang hangout, offsetting the juicy meat with marshmallow-like fat. he sends out chilled bang bang chicken that balances the poultry’s clean punch with the searing heat of chiles. he whips up shellfish boils on par with le sia, coating barely cooked-through lobster claws with a mess of salted chiles.and he also oversees a kitchen whose cooks ensure everything is sliced thinly enough to cook quickly. this part is simple enough: tongue tastes like tongue; spam tastes like spam. but for what it’s worth, the shaved ribeye is so well marbled it seems to disintegrate with the same elegance as japanese wagyu, and packs no less flavor at just $12. i recommend enjoying all these cuts in the back room, decorated with four 82-inch televisions, each of which shows jackie chan singing on a variety show, on mute.for those who insist on wagyu, yu liu’s tang hotpot, an offshoot of the east village noodle shack, provides it at a marginally lower cost. it’s sold here for $65, or as a smaller portion as part of an $80 combination platter with pleasantly chewy abalone, flaky snapper, heady goat leg, beef short ribs (cut a bit too thickly), paper-thin pork, and shrimp (impressively flavored when simmered in seafood soup).the only catch is that the broths, served communally in copper pops from yunnan, are nominally more expensive than those at zhen wei, though they can serve up to four, making them cheaper for larger parties. spicy sichuan starts at $18 for the table, while a more “curated” version of the same soup — with a separate pot of pork bone broth — runs $23. spoiler: both taste about the same, delivering no more complexity or flavor than than the versions at zhen wei (and arguably a touch less). that brings up the central issue with tang. notwithstanding the fact that new yorkers unquestionably underpay for chinese fare in almost every form, the quality of tang’s food and service don’t necessarily match the higher prices it commands. its beef and lamb selections don’t sing with the clear, powerful flavors one expects. and really, there’s no need for condiments like $4 truffle-oil sesame paste.but what tang can flaunt is a smart beverage program, energetic bar crowds, and shiny digs — evocative of a mid-aughts power spot — by new practice studio, the same firm that did stylish restaurants hao noodle and hunan slurp.a host escorts canada goose jacket-wearing patrons to room booths. louis poulsen radiohus pendant lights, set at uneven heights, do their best impression of summertime fireflies, casting dim luminescence on italian soapstone tables and chartreuse banquettes. a balcony overlooks the dining room — evoking geoffrey zakarian’s erstwhile town — while most tables get a clear view of artist xu han’s piece de resistance, a painting of tang-court women incongruously eating modern hot pot alongside an oktoberfest-sized lager.staffers ferry over sparkling orange wines in thin-lipped glasses, or sake cocktails in coconut shells, often 10 minutes after you order them. and smart-tablet ordering systems mean that food sometimes starts to arrive at your table before a waiter finishes taking your order. aside from hot pot, only a few cold appetizers are on tap for now: run-of-the-mill mung bean noodles with chile sauce or a somewhat limp cold chicken in sesame paste. chef baiguang han, late of szechuan mountain house, doesn’t get to show off his culinary chops as much as his counterpart at zhen wei. one exception is a nice platter of braised and chilled meats, a collection that shows off beef shank, duck wings, pig’s ear, and gizzards in all their chewy, snappy, gelatinous glory. that aside, stick to the raw meats and seafood, the nice wines, and the chinatown ice cream factory scoops of lychee ice cream.successive waves of gentrification have been pummeling the bowery since at least the early 2000s, from the avalon luxury developments and its $3,000-per-month studios to the sprawling clubstaurant that is vandal, a behemoth that earns its riches by commercializing the street’s artistically populist ethos of yore. hot pot spots hawking expensive japanese beef certainly won’t solve any larger urban problems, alas. but inasmuch as the city continues to change, it’s good to see both older and younger chinese operators get in on the action, while still keeping things more accessible than their western counterparts.cost: soup base is $5-$6 per person. meat prices vary per cut. short rib or beef tongue is $10; prime ribeye is $13; hand-sliced lamb is $16; japanese wagyu is $80. most other selections — snapper, spam, noodles, mushrooms, and blue crab (packed with sweet roe) — run at $10 or less.sample dishes: spicy bang bang chicken, hot-stone wagyu beef, spicy lobster, grilled lamb skewers, japanese wagyu, prime ribeye, hand-sliced beef, tripe, snapper, blue crab, fried golden mantou buns with condensed milk.bonus tip: don’t sleep on the precooked spicy shellfish dishes — no hot pot swishing required. also: most tables have individual hamper baskets to protect coats and sweaters from the steam and aroma of fragrant sichuan peppercorns.cost: communal hot pots run from $15 (heady pumpkin seafood broth) to $18 (spicy szechuan beef tallow) to $23 (curated spicy beef tallow with a separate pot of pork bone broth). combo platters, which do not include soup base, cost anywhere from $45 (chicken, red clam, tilapia, vegetables) to $80 (with japanese wagyu, short ribs, lamb, abalone). a la carte wagyu is $65.sample dishes: master stock braised meat platter (duck feet, duck tongue, beef shanks, pig ears), mung bean noodles in chile paste, japanese wagyu, beef tripe, lamb, goat leg, short rib, berkshire pork shoulder, lychee ice cream.bonus tip: tang hotpot is smaller than zhen wei fang; be sure to book ahead via resy. also consider the $25 weekday lunch.sign up for our newsletter.with soggy fish and chips and an ammonia-tinged tartare, the british import manages to be the worst new restaurant in nyc this yearto comprehend the complex awfulness of bluebird london — a soulless, overpriced, and curiously packed british import at the time warner center — it helps to recall some vintage english sketch comedy. the actor rowan atkinson, in his famous “steak tartare” skit, contorts his face a thousand different ways while choking down a grayish patty of raw meat. instead of sending it back, however, he hides the remnants in a small tin of salt, in a woman’s pocketbook, and down the pants of a tableside violinist. everyone else in the restaurant is oblivious.the bit riffed on multiple themes, from food as an acquired taste to the shame of appearing insufficiently cultured in pompous environs. but there was arguably a plainer lesson tucked in there too: sometimes expensive cuisine is just bad, and it’s strange when no one else in the dining room seems to notice.such is the case at bluebird, the stateside debut of d&d london, one of the u.k.’s most prominent hospitality groups. it’s a sleek brasserie that, despite its manifestly dreadful food — from soggy fish and chips to blubbery duck — can fill up with hundreds of patrons during dj-fueled brunches. it’s also a venue that sent out a steak tartare so abominable, i struggled to keep it down.good tartare deploys powerful seasonings to highlight the subtleties of good steak. but the bluebird version i sampled leaned on spiced ketchup and capers to mask something on the verge of spoiling. the initial flavor was bland, quickly followed by a fetid, ammonia-like tang. it was an aroma that recalled room-temperature hamburger meat from a grocer that lost power. i felt my eyes water up as i chewed. i tried to swallow. i felt my entire gi tract prepare to purge. and then i regained my composure and pulled an atkinson, which is to say: i spat the nasty bits into a napkin and stuffed it into my briefcase.let me be clear: bluebird is new york’s worst new restaurant of 2018. for those who hoped to avoid this sort of thing anyway, keep in mind that next year, d&d will open up an 11,000-square-foot brasserie in the sprawling hudson yards complex.to be fair, the columbia circle venue, situated in the former a voce space, never promised culinary fireworks; the london original has always attracted more attention for its chic environs than its culinary accomplishments. bluebird in new york, true to form, is pretty. green booths are arranged in a sinuous s-shaped arrangement. bottles of gin stand on a plastic sculpture meant to evoke a human head. purple seats serve as vibrant accents against off-white sofas. and for select tables near the windows, nighttime diners get a brilliant view of central park south and trump tower. everyone else experiences obstructed vistas and dining-room reflections.clockwise, from top left: the dining room at bluebird, tuna poke bowl, lobster mac & cheesefor a blunter sense of the priorities here, consider the following: the restaurant’s website dedicates an entire page to the bios of the brunch entertainment. for example: dj sweat apparently faced off against an actor from the wire in a dj battle. now you know.the chef, in turn, is publicized with just two short words: his name, which i’ll respectfully withhold since the menu feels like it was cobbled together by a mercenary consultant or an ai-concocted algorithm instead of a culinary professional. what else could explain “brooklyn” charcuterie, “long island” burrata, poke bowls (of course there are poke bowls), or those infamous 2005-era favorites, lobster mac and cheese and truffle fries?the mac tastes like what would happen if a college student microwaved ziti with supermarket shellfish bisque and waxy pre-shredded cheese. as for the truffles, the black fungi shavings adhere to two or three mealy, undercooked fries like glue. and those poke bowls betray the good name of that hawaiian mainstay, typically a dice of raw fish bursting with notes from additions such as soy and sesame. instead, the blocks of tuna are as icy and insipid as the quinoa with which they’re paired; it tastes as if it died in the walk-in cooler.for a marginally better starter, try the foie gras terrine, though that would mean paying $34 for a few bites of liver over a pile of cold green beans and a single artichoke. the prevailing culinary ethos behind that appetizer seems to be: clean out the fridge. bluebird’s sleepy continental preparations are par for the course at the time warner center. as so many currents of diversity pulsate throughout the city’s dining scene — from modern chinese to new indian to creative vietnamese — this multibillion-dollar complex remains overwhelmingly european and shockingly exorbitant. it stands as a bulwark against the multi-ethnic traditions of nearby hell’s kitchen. there are, of course, outliers. david chang opened an affordable ramen shop here this year. and masa serves some pretty good sushi for those who’d like to spend $1,000 on a meal for one. those aside, the dining options here trend a bit monochromatic.across from bluebird, there’s a french bakery, a french cafe, and a french-italian brasserie. one floor above, there’s a gallic-american tasting temple where dinner runs $500 to $800 per person. and let’s not forget the bar that sells caviar, burgers, and filet mignon, located right next to an american steakhouse that also sells...caviar, burgers, and filet mignon. and at the mandarin oriental, there’s a duo of cocktail spots where a few rounds of drinks can cost more than a ski jacket, and a place called asiate, where the kitchen channels the global east by seasoning french food with lemongrass.diversity is not a driving force when a small group of humans at a multi-billion dollar real estate company curate the dining selections for many. that’s something to think about as the hudson yards complex nears completion. and that’s something to contemplate over a $65 strip, bluebird’s cheapest steak at dinner during a recent visit (now: $58). the cut lacks much of the compelling sweetness, complex char, or supremely beefy essence that dry-aged meats typically have; it’s a squishy cut of meat with an overpowering funk. i paired it with truffle madeira jus ($8) that had all the flavor of powdered onion soup mix. i also ordered fries, which prompted the kitchen to send out a second order of fries as a gift to this solo diner, for no particular reason. my two-course meal that night, with two drinks, cost $159 after tax and tip.in a city teeming with eurocentric gastropubs, trattorias, bistros, and brasseries, the opening of a new one raises the obvious question: what is it really adding to the our culinary scene? is it obsessed with moving the needle forward, like a frenchette? or is it dedicated to recreating the classics better than anyone else, like a la mercerie? it’s not hard, after all, to find an average terrine, cheese souffle, or burger in new york, and bluebird’s are all decidedly below average. the farmhouse pork pate recalls supermarket ham wrapped in old bread. the twice-baked comte souffle forgoes ethereal silkiness in favor of grittiness. and the burger suffers from an almost equal ratio of cheddar to beef; the bland patty is so undercooked it almost takes on the texture of warm fondue.roast duck for two ($98) arrives almost wholly unseasoned, with mealy flesh and a thick, under-rendered layer of fat. better is the lobster thermidor, whose delicately cooked meat packs tons of oceanic flavor — just be sure to eat around the leaden bechamel glaze, and understand you’re paying $38 for an appetizer’s worth of meat.if pressed to order anything at dinner, a mound of crab with trout roe expresses its maritime punch with aplomb. and at peak brunch, one can expect a great english breakfast — rich morcilla, porky sausages, baked tomatoes, sweet beans — as well as a dry pain au chocolat, a stale croissant, and a dj who spends more time checking his iphone than working the turntable. he looks bored. desserts are respectable enough, from the sticky toffee pudding, which is sufficiently sticky, to the classic bakewell tart, a blend of fragrant almond paste and orange marmalade. with a cup of tea, that pastry would be a civilized choice for a rainy afternoon in the city. otherwise, for a more reliable view of central park in an equally basic setting, try j.crew next door.cost: starters at $7-$34; mains at $23-$49; large format dishes at $95 (beef wellington), $98 (roasted duck), and $110 (cote de boeuf). dinner will easily run over $100 per person.sample dishes:  cheese sticks, ahi tuna poke bowl, fluke crudo, jonah crab with trout roe, farmhouse pork terrine, grilled lobster thermidor, fish & chips, twice baked comté cheese souffle, bakewell tart. bonus tip: come before sunset for more panoramic columbus circle and central park views from throughout the dining room.jenny kwak is a chef at the top of her game, moving deftly between traditional korean and actually exciting fusion fare in park slopeamid new york’s ever-globalizing culinary scene, a culture of cross-pollination continues to thrive. the city’s finest barbecue shack sells not just texas brisket but stellar jerk pork. an ambitious indian spot in gramercy sends out pitch-perfect tandoori chicken — and guacamole to boot. an asian rotisserie in midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox. and now at haenyeo, a knockout of a korean hangout in park slope, the kitchen whips up bouillabaisse as masterful as that of any gallic temple. chef-owner jenny kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic french soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and pernod. the rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. a filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in marseille — glutinous rice cakes. mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. and then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen. the warmth of the stew doubles the urchin’s natural sugars and triples its musk. at this point you might search for the traditional bouillabaisse accompaniment of croutons with rouille to add a bit of garlicky cream and crunch to the stew. except there’s none of that here. kwak instead presents a baguette slathered with seaweed butter. let it soak in the broth, then appreciate how the sweet nori enriches the mixture.if that’s still too european, kwak offers more traditional dishes too, from bulgogi to raw fish bibimbap bowls — alongside with mexican-leaning fundidos and louisiana-style shellfish. haenyeo might take its name from the women who free-dive for seafood off of korea’s jeju island, but its approach to cuisine is often decidedly and unabashedly internationalist.park slope’s collection of korean restaurants is still small, which is fitting. that country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of east village representation there before kwak and her mother, myung ja kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. the duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd street. the mother-daughter team opened up dok suni’s on first avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.writers praised their efforts, though they sometimes used language that should’ve come across as troublesome then, as it is now. new york magazine’s fran schumer began her suni’s review with this slight: “you’d rather have spaghetti than kimchi any day, but there are times when cold pickled cabbage tastes that good.” new york times critic william grimes lauded kwak’s use of tasting menus to “demystify” korean food at do hwa in the west village. “for years the city’s korean restaurants made no concessions to newcomers, who faced a struggle figuring out what the dishes were, how to order them and how to eat them,” he wrote in 2000. food will always adapt, but pointing out a particular cuisine’s so-called lack of concessions or instructions is a dicier affair. that said, the korean restaurant community has evolved over the decades — as have the journalists covering it. it’s been ages since a reviewer has used the word “forbidding” in association with any of these fine venues, or (unnecessarily) mentioned that the waiters “speak english well.”korean fried chicken is about as ubiquitous as any other style. a certain galbi-slinging barbecue spot in flatiron is harder to get into than any local steakhouse. a multibillion-dollar real estate complex is selling ’grammable rice cakes shaped like pinwheels. and late last year marked the debut of haenyeo, whose kitchen exhibits a stunning fluency in alternating between more traditional and more modern, fusion-y preparations. there’s something profoundly warming about walking past a bustling al di la, the italian pride of park slope, and noticing that haenyeo across the street is no less packed. miles davis pipes through the sound system as families eat fried scallops with corn tartare — an “is-it-summer-yet” melange of oceanic and terrestrial sugars — and scallion pancakes; the slices of spicy onion are held together with so little batter they’re effectively modernist tempura sculptures. the corner space, with handsome brown floor planks, french-style bar stools, and ample natural light, screams neighborhood cafe, and that’s partly the plan. haenyeo will open for lunch and brunch this summer, serving up coffee and eggs with “jambalaya rice.” for now, it’s dinner only, with a no-reservations policy for most party sizes. the wait on saturdays can surpass 90 minutes.anyone who tries the oysters will understand the pulsating crowds. kwak grills them over hardwood briquettes, a hat tip to the new orleans heritage of her husband, terrence segura, with whom she shares ownership. she’s not the first person to do this in new york, but she might be the most skilled. the wellfleet bivalves display an aggressive plumpness; they pop with a gentle press of the tongue, gushing with hot seaweed butter.equally stunning is the rustic-internationalist take on fundido, typically a glorious gut bomb of melted cheese. here, that ingredient constitutes just the epidermal layer of a deeper, bubbling casserole. beneath the scorched cheese, an aggressively milky oaxacan variety, lies a pool of chile sauce and mounds of tteokbokki, oblong korean rice cakes. pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface. the combination of flavors and textures — chewy rice cakes, hot peppers, tart sauce, spiced sausage, and stretchy, melty cheese — feels like less of a true fundido and more of a korean-mexican riff on baked ziti. then, a moment later, kwak switches gear to modern-refined fare. she serves ordinary grilled mackerel in a very distinct way, by pairing it with square sheets of nori. the mackerel is soft and neutral, boasting gently smoky overtones. it’s borderline boring until you wrap it in seaweed, which imparts the fish with a hint of brine and a crisp, snappy texture. you dunk the hand roll, a striking contrast of white and green, in crimson gochujang paste, lighting up the palate with salt and sweet chiles.the menu has a few minor misses, from run-of-the-mill beef kimchi gyoza — ordinary fried dumplings — to a bland mound of chile-braised tofu. better are the puffy fried chicken bites laced with jalapenos, as well as the korean seafood stew, a smaller, more classic answer to the fancier bouillabaisse. the soup, chock full of silky soybean curd and firm shrimp, is milder in flavor than the spendier french version, sporting just a touch of shellfish concentrate. and then there is the classic soy-and-sesame-marinated ribeye bulgogi, cut paper-thin and piled high on a platter for wrapping in crisp lettuce and shiso leaves.louisiana-style beignets are the appropriate way to end a meal here. the dough itself is relatively unsweetened, giving the confections the taste of a classic street-fair zeppole. so much powdered sugar is applied that you will inhale some as you eat. “not korean” is the disclaimer that kwak appends to her instagrams of that dessert. “for me, staying true or preserving korean flavors is the main goal,” the chef writes in an email. but she adds that “there are so many influences around me, mostly from traveling but even from living in nyc,” that she allows herself more room to experiment than she did earlier in career. may she continue to do so.cost: starters at $9-$16; larger share plates at $16-$34. seaweed baguette is a (worthwhile) $6 supplement to the $29 bouillabaisse.sample dishes: sauteed glass noodles in sesame, rice cake fundido with chorizo, scallion pancake, grilled oysters with seaweed butter, grilled mackerel with nori, spicy winter bouillabaisse, thinly sliced ribeye with lettuce wraps, sugar-dusted beignets.bonus tip: reservations only available for six or more; the best way to avoid the wait is to dine earlier in the week, in the off hours, or best of all, at the bar, where things are first come, first served.pinsa, the thin and crispy pizza famous in rome, is the specialty heremontesacro pinseria is a serious roman restaurant masquerading as a pizzeria. the pizza, of course, is the almost faddish pinsa, an oblong flop of well-browned dough made from a combination of wheat, rice, and soy flour, tracing its roots back to ancient rome. part of a mini chain that includes another branch in portland, the restaurant was founded in san francisco in 2015, and claims to be the first pinseria in the united states.our branch — run by owner gianluca legrottaglie, chef riccardo buitoni, and wine director emanuele tibaldo — lies in central williamsburg, just above the lorimer l stop on union avenue. if the place seems eerily familiar, that’s because it was the former and much-missed bistro dumont. now, the front room is quiet and serene, with a bar running along one side and an open kitchen at the end of the room, so open you can reach in and grab a loaf of freshly made bread, warm, moist, and with a dense crumb.but a crooked hallway runs around the kitchen to the place most diners settle down: the covered rear patio. with a black interior and bright spotlights, it feels like an airport runway at midnight. the patio seats 70 or so, and potted plants are scattered here and there. big tables can be easily pushed together into bigger tables, where groups seeking post-work pizza hunker down, with huzzahs rising up to the retractable ceiling.let’s ignore the pinsa for a minute. romans are very fond of variety meats, and evidence of this is a marvelous pig head roulade ($11), composed of smoky and greasy swirls of white fat and pink flesh. there’s also a tripe dish, roman-style in a cheesy tomato sauce. what’s the difference between it and the famed tripe of florence? well, roman tripe is further seasoned with fresh mint, an herb often seen in roman cooking. you’ll be seeing more of it at montesacro.unless incorporated onto a pinsa, vegetables ($13 to $16) will not be the most memorable aspect of your meal. most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal romanesco, also undercooked; and brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. the notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash. it gets crumbed like tempura, making the mellow orange vegetable crunchy and soft at the same time, and then dribbled with honey and heaped with grated cheese. get three orders and it could happily be your entire meal.pastas play an important, if minor, role on the bill of fare, and all i’ve tasted have been unfailingly excellent. closely associated with rome, egg-yolky carbonara ($18) shines yellow in its bowl, dotted with cured guanciale in little salty tidbits and poured over mezze maniche, stunted tubules that trap more sauce than the spaghetti traditionally used. the effect is like breakfast bacon and eggs.but make sure you examine the easy-to-miss special menu, which flaps on a tiny slip of paper stapled to the regular one. special pastas have included potato gnocchi, soft as a winter mitten, mired in a fibrous beef cheek sauce that clings in great globs to the pasta, and burrata-filled ravioli lavished with fresh chanterelles and grated truffle pecorino. at $20 for a substantial serving, how can the restaurant afford to offer it?the five-item list of specials that day was particularly compelling due to its component of fresh mushrooms, served at just the season when they’re harvested in italy. this is meta-restaurateuring at its best, meaning certain indefinable features besides the food will transport you to rome. there was also a wild boar chop in a ragu of fresh porcinis, and a pinsa that featured italian sausage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. a friend and i ordered all three mushroom specials that evening and enjoyed a fungal orgy.there are only three proper secondi: a fish, a steak, and a chicken. the waiter warned us away from the steak, which comes in a salsa verde more appropriate to florentine cooking. you might choose the crisp-skinned chicken pressed under a brick instead, but conventional entrees here will never be the highlight of your meal.inevitably, we come to the pinsas. the variety is vast, and the individual diner will pick the pizza with the combination of ingredients that pleases her most. i can see digging the one with broccoli rabe and spicy sausage (maranella, $20), or the pie that sports tomatoes, fried eggplant, and two kinds of cheese, including the unmeltable ricotta salata (portonaccio, $19).i selected instead a pinsa that’s assembled after the pie comes out of the oven, making the toppings warm but not hot. you won’t burn your tongue out of eagerness on the garbatella ($21), which features wads of really great albacore tuna, purple onions, and caper mayonnaise. yes, it tastes like the world’s best tuna salad sandwich. another favorite outlier merits a special box by itself on the menu — focaccia der muratore, wherein a thin layer of pinsa dough sheaths slices of mortadella. for bologna lovers, this is pig heaven.besides pizzeria and roman restaurant, montesacro enjoys a further identity as a wine bar. the list has many diverting specimens that would go well with pizza. unfortunately, many tend to be a little pricey for this usage, including a nero d’avola and an etna rosso from sicily ($60 and $70, respectively), reds with a flinty taste issuing from volcanic soils. other wines come from spain, france, turkey, slovenia, and chile, but the one that drinks best with pizza, to my taste, is a fizzy and almost sweet red lambrusco ($48) from the emilia-romagna producer vecchia modena.on the other hand, you should never be ashamed of eating your pinsa the way romans often do, with that venerable roman beverage, coca-cola. only in this case, it will be a bottle of mexican coke.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, one pinsa, and one pasta, plus two glasses of wine and tax but not tip, $90. sample dishes: porchetta (herby roast pork), zucca frita (delicata squash), garbatella pinsa (tuna and caper mayonnaise), pollo al mattone (chicken under a brick).what to drink: any sparkling wine by the bottle or glass, white grechetto from lazio, draft pilsner beer, or bottled spanish cider.bonus tip: while you won’t have room, there are some commendable desserts, including a panna cotta flavored with dried fennel, and navel-shaped biscotti that come with a free glass of red wine. drink and dip.  red paper clip is busy and filled with promise, but two blue hill alum chefs aren’t fulfilling them yetnot too long into dinner at red paper clip, an asian-leaning tasting-menu spot in the west village, a server brings over an ash-colored plate decorated with white swirls of yogurt and scattered herbs. “carrot katsu,” he says. this is unusual, not just because this breadcrumb-enriched cutlet is typically made with pork or chicken, but rather because this style of japanese cooking isn’t frequently seen at a bastion of expensive eating — unless it involves a fat slab of luxurious wagyu. the katsu packs a deeper, denser crunch than a more cloud-like piece of tempura. the exterior, however, quickly yields to a softer orange interior, at once vaguely sweet and savory. those swirls of yogurt, in turn, add a soothing tang, while shiso oil conveys a minty, licorice-tinged perfume. on a good night, it easily ranks as one of the better katsu dishes in a town, and it shows that a more rustic japanese dish like this one is just as deserving of a place on a tasting menu as a slice of blow-torched tuna neck. on a bad night, however, the carrots are undercooked and cloying. the aroma of the shiso is flat. and the conversation ends there, a disappointing conclusion to an exciting idea. “these are black truffles from oregon,” a waiter announces a few minutes later, shaving them over something dubbed xiaolongbao agnolotti. it’s a cross between the italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. you pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. it never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. and at $95 for the tasting, the price isn’t too shabby either.the two-month-old red paper clip, an uneven solo debut from kevin chen and tashi gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. one is about a duo of blue hill at stone barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. as sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while luthun in the west village and reverence in harlem represent newer entrants to the field. and while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to red paper clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. the people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.the presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of china. chen, a native new yorker of taiwanese descent, and gyamtso, who was raised in tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves cantonese, shanghainese, and himalayan ingredients with those from france, italy, japan, and elsewhere. that’s no small matter. while a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of taiwan, hong kong, and the mainland, chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.a waiter shaves black truffles over xlb agnolotti.tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.but the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. a restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. and inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their western (or japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see chen and gyamtso prove folks wrong.there are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. corey lee’s benu in san francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while kato in los angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other taiwanese delicacies. but in new york, an expression of chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of xo sauce here, a dab of indiscernible sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.it’s for this reason that one might scoff at red paper clip’s sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. a sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. and finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an estela or a wildair, but its dna feels sichuan through and through.then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. it’s just another carpaccio.here’s simplicity at its best: chen and gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. this infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. things are quite lovely. until they’re not. during another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of september. underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that chen and gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. red paper clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. or consider the lobster three ways. there’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. the butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. and the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.that criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. they have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. an act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. but it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. the late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. the kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. these “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. whimsical moments like these suggest that red paper clip will eventually find its groove. for now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.cost: the dining room is tasting-only at $95 (gratuity is extra). the bar menu includes a tight collection of small plates at $18-$37.sample dishes: nori fettuccine with maitake, carrot katsu, sichuan beef carpaccio, agnolotti xiaolongbao, lobster three ways, smoked short rib with fermented greens and yeasted potato.bonus tip: there is currently no list of wines by the bottle; the restaurant, rather, employs a “human wine list,” with whom you discuss your preferences. patrons, of course, are handicapped by not knowing the range of prices. (“this isn’t intentional; we haven’t gotten around to putting together the list,” a bartender says.) in the meantime, go by the glass.chef erik ramirez’s village hot spot beautifully delivers on nikkei fare, a style rarely seen in new yorkambitious modern sushi is typically a very specific thing in new york. that is: a traditional and expensive omakase parlor hawking exquisitely butchered fish, much of it endangered bluefin, over vinegared rice. sushi at llama san in greenwich village, however, is a very different thing. the stunner of a peruvian spot offers just a single type of nigiri, forged from duck, cilantro, and fried banana.there is no chef standing solemnly behind a counter, doling out pristine morsels piece by piece. chef erik ramirez simply sends his creations into the blonde-wood dining room, where fiona apple’s “criminal” pipes through the sound system. a staffer walks to and fro waving burning palo santo sticks, blessing the space with pungent smoke. four nasturtium leaves, so green they’re practically glowing, seem to hover above the plate. under each one lies the sushi: a mound of coriander rice below a sheath of paper-thin duck breast. the perfume of coriander hits the palate first, then the savoriness of the rice, then the the earthy essence of aged waterfowl. and just when the gaminess starts to creep up, the banana, tucked between the grains and the bird like a pat of wasabi, issues a whisper of sweetness. this is sushi that’s as worthy of critical contemplation as any toro hand roll. and while llama san offers an omakase that runs $500 for two after drinks, the duck nigiri is only available a la carte, for $24.from top left: nasturtium sitting over aged duck nigiri; patrons gathering in a packed bar room; head bartender natasha bermudez placing an ice cube in a palo santo-filled glassperuvian restaurants constitute a vital part of new york-area restaurant landscape, furnishing everything from grilled skewers to tart ceviches to rotisserie chickens. what ramirez is doing at llama san, however, constitutes a branch of andean cuisine with less obvious (if growing) stateside representation. that style of cooking is called nikkei, a fusion of peruvian and japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the south american country’s culinary ethos. scores of japanese people emigrated to peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to u.s. internment camps during world war ii.generations later, myriad sushi and udon spots thrive from cusco to arequipa. anyone who’s been to a nobu has encountered some form of nikkei. its chef brought worldwide fame to tiradito (sashimi) with rocoto chile paste and filet mignon with zippy anticucho sauce. but while nobu has turned into a blandly internationalist chain that bills its food as japanese, llama san proudly calls itself nikkei, exhibiting a deeper level of virtuosity in the style.ramirez slicks translucent rice noodles in a sesame soy vinaigrette. they slurp up easily until a sucker punch of pepper pricks the tongue. he douses crimson cubes of tuna in ponzu; they seem to pulsate with the nuclear level of soy and yuzu. he pairs fried iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. and he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. the mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.his tofu acts as an essay in the colors yellow and white. a rectangular block of soy curd covers a mash of shrimp mousse, while a golden pool of garlicky seafood sauce imparts warmth. rice crackers hide a pile of tender lobster, displaying a charcoal-grilled singe, and smoky chunks of corazon — no gamier than skirt steak. it’s a surf and turf like no other; the shellfish jus and beefy heart drippings, fortified with oregano and vinegar, enrich a serving of sushi rice underneath.hand rolls are not uncommon in nikkei cuisine, but the way ramirez prepares them is. he takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. the combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.ramirez has emerged as the city’s most studied and satisfying purveyor of modern peruvian in all its diverse forms. he serves up beef corazon skewers at williamsburg’s llama inn; shrimp noodles and rotisserie birds at llamita in the west village; and now, at llama san, a compact menu of creative and visually striking small plates. most people in the dining room will justifiably only order off of the a la carte menu. but llama san also offers a $150 omakase, a rare south american tasting in new york. the 10-course meal largely pulls from the regular menu and is best for solo diners who want to experience the brilliance of llama san in a single sitting.the meal kicks off with a bite of kaluga caviar between two crisps. the kitchen could have easily let the roe stand alone; instead, it’s paired with a swatch of miso manjar blanco — a south american dulce du leche of sorts. purists might recoil at this combination, but the mix of oceanic brine and aromatic sugars is simply a perfumed riff on a sea salt-laced caramel.ramirez also sneaks in an off-menu oyakadon, a japanese chicken-over-rice bowl, which he crosses with estofado de pollo, a peruvian poultry stew. for this, he uses gizzards. japanese restaurants love to highlight the snappy texture of the digestive organ, but llama san takes a more rustic tact, braising them until they’re barely firmer than a chicken nugget. the little knobs, which flaunt just an inkling of poultry funk, sit sandwiched between an egg omelet and a layer of rice. the flavor profile recalls sweet tamago sushi crossed with rich sausage.does one need a hefty plate of wagyu short rib after six previous courses? probably not, and perhaps ramirez should consider showing off his stronger dishes, like the surf and turf or iberico, instead of ending yet another manhattan tasting menu with this ubiquitous luxury. that said, llama san sends out an impressively beefy cut, fortified with what might be the world’s greatest potato salad, which is laced with bites of squishy egg and tiny, sweet shrimp.ramirez operates with just as much skill at dessert, showering an undulating blob of custard with fanta-colored satsuma ice and halved gooseberries. the combination speaks to its component flavors: the egginess of the cream, the cool citrus punch of the granita, and the rampant acidity of the pulpy fruit. i ask the waiter if it’s based on a peruvian dessert. she responds that it’s based on a creamsicle. right on.older, fancier tasting spots cap off dinner with a flurry of petits fours. llama san instead offers a single bite and a shot of booze: a matcha truffle infused with muña (andean mint) and a few sips of pisco. the candy’s dusty exterior boasts a tannic astringency, but that bitterness quickly yields to a soft, buttery, grassy interior. the accompanying liquor parries the sugary blow. a restaurant doesn’t need to send out a mignardise to qualify as “fancy” or “good,” but inasmuch as the wagyu crowd considers this sort of thing as a signifier of luxury, ramirez and company are arguing that they can tango with the best of them. indeed, they can.cost: most dishes in the $20s and $30s. expect to spend about $100 per person or more for about three to four courses for each diner. the tasting runs $150 and must be booked in advance.sample dishes: scallop ceviche with cherimoya, tuna with ponzu, duck nigiri with fried banana, tofu with shrimp mousse and chile sauce, beef hearts and lobster over sushi rice, chicken thigh maki, iberico pork tonkatsu, creamsicle dessert.bonus tip: bar seating during prime time is often reserved via resy; check the app for cancellations. just the same, for a more sushi-heavy nikkei experience in new york, with omakase services as well, consider midtown’s sen sakana.keith mcnally’s restaurant reboot delivers charisma, gold-tinged nostalgia, and a familiar brasserie experience to a changed new yorkvoila: what was once an entire food hall, with myriad vendors and ample seating, is now a single chic french brasserie with two-hour waits. welcome to pastis 2.0, the rebirth of keith mcnally’s downtown gem that you might’ve first learned about (like i did) because lindsay lohan and other a-listers were slurping onion soup there in the aughts. the new location, run by mega-restaurateur stephen starr, sends out roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers a few blocks away from the old location, which was torn down to make way for a luxury home goods retailer that, on its rooftop, serves roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers. really, this is a certain segment of new york in a nutshell: more of the same. the thing is, in the case of pastis, it’s generally a good kind of same.the first incarnation, which fueled the nightly party that is the meatpacking district, was born in 1999 as a balthazar sequel of sorts. it simultaneously functioned as an affordable-ish hangout in an increasingly expensive nabe — remember when samantha from sex and the city revealed she paid $7,000 per month in rent here? — and a constant celebrity magnet. the partying was wild at times, but it never truly devolved into the type of rich kids of instagram debauchery that nearby spots became known for; there were no dance-party brunches where magnums of champagne came with sparklers or where jeroboams (if you don’t know what that is, you can’t afford one) triggered recognition by the dj.by meatpacking standards, pastis was chill and inviting. it still is.when a hip burger spot i no longer patronize turned us away in 2005, pastis took us in. and so we feasted on bacon-loaded tripe and drank stoli orange martinis (woof). things are a touch more crowded these days; a line of aspirants regularly snakes toward the door. no reservation? you’ll get quoted a multi-hour wait, though a host concedes that they hold back tables for regulars. now you know: be a regular. or be here at lunch when it’s quieter. or be famous. the second coming, like the first, remains a brilliantly fashionable place to people-watch. why hello there, dan abrams and ex-men’s health dude-itor dave zinczenko (or his doppelganger), bro-ing it up in a booth. such antics are more enjoyable than the filet au poivre, which is sometimes grayish and medium when ordered medium-rare, sometimes cold and blue when ordered rare. but the creamy pepper sauce covers up the flaws well enough, and oh, wait, is that john mayer? at a table surrounded by women? sounds about right. let me munch on some bland king crab, and whoa, gosh, what a nice mop of hair that mayer boy has. another $16 daiquiri? sure, why not.the space is a near replica of the old one, from the worn wood planks to the dark banquettes to the zinc bar to every other detail that suggests the venue is 40 years old and not a few months young. mcnally, who recently quipped that people go out to eat to escape their spouses, has hung so many artfully worn mirrors that getting caught cheating here is assured. buy me a hard seltzer one day, and i’ll tell you about the nearby celebrity cuddled up to a person who was not their spouse. that duo, with their aristocratic cheekbones, looked fabulous. so did everyone else. anyone who’s dined at mcnally’s restaurants knows they’re lit in a very particular type of gold, a hue that suggests that, somewhere in france, a quaint town exists where it is perpetually twilight. on a recent evening, after a glass of muscadet, i reached for a carafe filled with what appeared to be more of the precious liquid. alas, it was a jug of water, magically turned to wine by amber bulbs that make everything soft and fuzzy.pastis, in short, looks, feels, and tastes like the old pastis. or the current balthazar. it is a piece of nostalgia for an era that still exists, and for a type of food that is neither threatened nor in short supply. starr seems like a logical partner. he runs some of the city’s most distinctive and ambitious gallic spots, fueling the haute throwback ways of daniel rose’s le coucou and the classic-modern cafe vibes of marie-aude rose’s la mercerie. pastis, of course, is neither distinctive nor ambitious. it sends out basic, mostly well-executed brasserie fare. there is a pedigreed chef, but there is no bio on the website, no waiters who speak about him in reverent tones. they simply tell you how awesome the croque madame is. it is awesome. the haute ham and cheese sandwich — fat slices of toasted brioche, salty jambon, gooey gruyere, and a sunny-side-up egg — functions as effectively at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.pastis has “devised a menu so traditional that virtually every dish could qualify for protection by the french ministry of culture,” new york times food critic william grimes wrote in 2000. the statement could as easily apply to the 2019 offerings: tangy beef tartare, cardboard shrimp cocktail, nutty trout almandine, cloying, one-note bouillabaisse that tastes like it never met saffron. and snails. the snails are hot. they sit in little tubs of oil that bubble at the table. to watch someone consume an escargot too quickly is to watch the real-life version of wile e. coyote swallowing an acme bomb. let them cool, then let them squish around in your mouth like the amphibious garlic sponges that they are.those who order tuna ravigote will be no less pleased. a crimson circle of raw fish nearly takes up the circumference of a plate, lying underneath a verdant pile of mint, tarragon, basil, chive, and dill. herring, by contrast, tells its story more rustically, as a series of masterfully butchered slices matched with halved potatoes. it is a fine study in salt, smoke, and maritime gelatins.should you order the roast chicken? probably. the aggressive brining leaves the breast with a faintly springy texture, but after dredging the meat through rich jus, you won’t notice such details. the pairing is a giant bowl of mashed potatoes, equally buttery and starchy. but best of all are the lobster frites. the chefs roast a two-pound lobster, rip out its meat, drizzle it with about three pounds of garlic butter, and garnish it with fries for dunking. it tastes the way a good lobster should: like a sweetened version of the atlantic ocean.for dessert, order baba au rhum. a quenelle of cream looks like a cumulus cloud that’s about to be munched by an oblong pac-man cake. this being baba, the cake is naturally doused in rum. lots of rum. i’ve had baba just about everywhere, and can say without qualms that this is the only place where there is enough booze leftover to do a half a shot from the bowl. one feels buzzed afterwards. i like this place better than the old food hall.cost: starters $14-$28; mains $22-$59; desserts $12-$13. expect to spend about $100 or more per person after drinks, tax, and tip.sample dishes: tuna crudo, steak tartare, onion soup, snails with garlic butter, lobster frites, trout amandine, grilled lamb steak, filet au poivre.bonus tip: if the hosts quote a multi-hour wait, tell the bartender you’re looking to dine; the wait shouldn’t be longer than an hour. otherwise, scan resy for cancellations. also keep in mind that pastis might just be closed for an unannounced private event the night you show up.the greenwich village mainstay is seemingly stuck in the past, even with a new menu from chef victoria blameythe sale of foie gras — a fatty indulgence that punches you in the gut, steals your money, and tries to make you feel good about that transaction — will soon be illegal in new york city. most restaurants, however, won’t have to do much to comply. force-fed duck livers don’t enjoy as much popularity among young culinarians, a class of hospitality types that turns to nimbler luxuries like uni, abalone, and truffles. in fact, simply encountering foie on a new restaurant menu is somewhat rare.gotham bar & grill is an uncommon establishment in this regard. foie takes center stage at the famed american venue. this is all the more surprising given that the greenwich village fixture, for the first time in 34 years, boasts an ambitious new chef: victoria blamey, who takes over from alfred portale. blamey lets foie show off its sweet side, juxtaposing it against saltier, chewier ham hock. for a more savory affair, she glazes the product with a layer of truffled seaweed gelee, imparting the stomach-distending, main course-sized appetizer with bass notes of earthiness. and in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin. it’s a fine ode to 1996, when gotham paired this delicacy with guinea hen or squab, or to 2013, when the restaurant featured a trio of simultaneous foie preparations as well.excess is the point of this extravagance, and blamey prepares it well. but as a legacy restaurant looks toward the future, perhaps a wallet-busting old-school indulgence shouldn’t occupy so much real estate on a tight bill of fare. and while the poussin-foie is now gone, there’s still something retro about the larger framework of the venue, a contemporary greenmarket restaurant serving two big steaks and two types of caviar while offering just a single vegetarian main.“in a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, gotham bar and grill is an outlier,” wrote new york times critic sam sifton in 2011. it was, in his words, a restaurant that celebrated “stability and excellence.” and while the owners in 2019 decided to seek change — a claim backed up by hiring blamey — sifton’s assessment still largely holds true.portale, in his early reign, ranked among the most influential and envelope-pushing new american chefs. in the mid-’80s, he acted as an early champion of seasonal, local fare. and more famously, he built dishes vertically, constructing seafood salads as if they were edible marie antoinette wigs. but even as gotham trended more internationalist in the 21st century, its influence waned amid the brash, stripped-down small-plates era of the aughts and beyond.the acquisition of a younger chef, who built a reputation for whimsical and inventive tavern fare at chumley’s, could have been an opportunity for a full reset. but notwithstanding a touch of high acid here, a bit of maine uni there, and smart smattering of chiles everywhere, it’s not clear this is truly blamey’s establishment. gotham very much remains gotham, minus any long-faded excellence.counterclockwise, from top left: patrons dining under puffy chandeliers; chef victoria blamey plating a dish during service; beef tartare underneath crispy tendon; diners perusing the menu in the rear dining areayes, the dishes are new, but this is still a big restaurant with big portions, big prices, a bar longer than some entire east village restaurants, a lounge menu with an epic crab galette, and a fortified host stand operated by four people who look like they spearhead j.p. morgan’s private wealth management division.on the way to your table, you pass under puffy fabric chandeliers, past a party of five guys (each of them wearing blue-collared button-downs), past three gray-haired men in suits (two of them order the foie), and up and down a few stairs. a waiter is quick to mention they are sold out of the $90 caviar, and can only offer the $140 version.sometimes the food feels in sync with both new and old gastronomy. the kitchen laces beef tartare with confit tomato, showers it with fluffy gran queso, and tops it off with a wavy tendon chicharon. the layering recalls the altitude of portale’s architectural tuna tartare, but in a way that’s distinctly, well, blamey. but on those rare occasions when the menu feels loose and modern, the service takes a strange and stodgy turn. if a party of three has one man and two women, should a host really ask: “will the gentleman sit in the middle?” should servers say things like, “i’ll bring a cocktail list for the lady?” should a waiter really ask me, the only male at the table, about whether to clear the wine list after a female companion does all the ordering? should he make eye contact only with me when asking to clear a course? does gotham require that certain staffers follow robert’s rules of order (1876) in addressing guests by the third person? if so, ryan sutton doesn’t like it.a modern restaurant seamlessly weaves meat-free (or meat-light) dishes into its offerings, prompting diners of all stripes to order them without qualms. gotham instead sends out dishes that can feel like obligatory concessions to those with dietary restrictions. beet kimchi ribbons, tomato, and trout roe sit over a pile of stracciatella doing a bland impression of cream cheese. the result is a preparation that tastes like a failed take on a 1980s chevre and beet salad. lapsang souchong adds a whisper of smokiness to japanese eggplant with sea island peas, but for naught. the dish is simply a bland, mushy mess (though on another visit, it boasts a more complex roundness and tang). pea dal, in turn, sit in a rich bath of coconut milk and curry leaf oil. it’s a preparation that begs for naan or rice — or really anything to placate the grainy wallop. at gotham, it comes with nothing. it is simply a thick, gritty, unbalanced stew of legumes, an incomplete side dish posing as a composed appetizer.the good news, however, is that the sole vegetarian entree showcases blamey at her best. she chars caraflex cabbage, drenches it in brown butter, pairs it with a seaweed gremolata, and throws everything over firm beads of fregola pasta. the dish is a striking blend of starch, smoke, restrained fat, and buzzing savoriness.ruth reichl, in her own three-star review over two decades ago, described the mains as “straightforward,” a qualifier that still feels apt in 2019. madai (sea bream) expresses itself as a run-of-the-mill, “here’s a clunky slab of overcooked fish” over a zingy green tomato and poblano sauce. better is slow-cooked lamb shoulder. it shows off the animal’s agrarian musk with greater degree than most fancy spots, while a calabrian chile sauce lights the palate ablaze. it would be a perfect four-bite starter. as a more herculean main, though, it feels burdensome.and then there’s the foie gras-laced poussin, whose breast mimicked the texture of overcooked tofu dragged through sand.at the bar, a shorter collection of dishes shows off the calculated risk-taking that blamey was renowned for at chumley’s. her spreadable boar rillette packs equal parts funk and heat; it is like an american answer to ’nduja. she stuffs smoked sturgeon into little “everything” eclairs for an haute hat tip to ashkenazi appetizing traditions (currently off the menu). she douses raw scallops in citrus and granada chile, resulting in what might be the city’s most wonderfully pungent and peppery ceviche. the true showstopper is the crab galette, a riff on the traditional chupe stew of chile, blamey’s native country. a puffy disc of pastry yields to a thick layer of pulled dungeness meat. the flesh is laced with chartreuse, tomato, and chile. while an ordinary crabcake often feels lethargic on the palate, her pie hums with acid, spice, and the rich taste of the sea. on a good night, at least. a repeat sampling resulted in more muted flavors.for dessert, consider the souffle. no denser than soft meringue, it shows off a whiff of perfumed peach, checked by the farmer’s funk of tart sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream. a tarte tatin for two does everything that’s expected of it, employing soft, flaky, buttery pastry as a conveyance mechanism for bouncy, caramelized, autumnally aromatic apples. but pain perdu, alas, functions as a pedestrian elevation of the classic french toast dish, albeit for $15. it feels like a dessert that could come from any fancy restaurant from 2009 or 1999. and that pretty much sums up gotham. the establishment isn’t so much moving the culinary scene forward as it is acting as an ode to itself. for a restaurant of a certain age and its patrons, that’s probably okay. let them eat foie gras.cost: starters at $17-$29; mains at $27-$55; most desserts at $15. those prices exclude caviar ($90-$140), steak for two ($135), the souffle ($22), and the tarte tatin for two ($28). expect to spend about $125-$150 per person in the main dining room, and a bit less in the bar room.sample dishes: scallop ceviche, foie gras with seaweed and truffle gelee, beef tartare with tendon, charred eggplant with sea island pea, elysian fields lamb shoulder, caraflex cabbage, peach souffle with sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream.bonus tip: the restaurant is reasonably busy, and sometimes packed, on any given night, but the expansiveness of the space means that same-day tables aren’t too tough to come by on resy; gotham also accommodates walk-ins both at the bar and the dining room.the restaurant is a foil to its flashier upstairs sibling, estiatorio milos, offering a far more generous ideation of a mall restaurantto dine at estiatorio milos in hudson yards, one of the city’s most expensive seafood restaurants, is to witness the efforts of a small army. over 130 staffers tend to fire-spitting grills, butcher whole fish, turn entire mackerel into tartare a la minute, and carve up turbot tableside in mere moments. to dine downstairs at milos wine bar, however, is to witness a very different ballet, and arguably a more compelling one. just two or so chefs prepare every item on the much shorter menu. they slice raw tuna and anoint it with yuzu kosho. they lay a sinuous octopus tentacle on a wicked-hot grill. they drizzle madagascar prawns with olive oil. they shave succulent pork off a rotating spit for gyros. for this four-course feast, plus two glasses of wine, tax, and tip, you pay just $88. that much wouldn’t buy you half a lobster pasta upstairs at dinner.i had strong words for estiatorio milos shortly after it opened, and again today. no matter how grand (or average) your mediterranean-tinged meal there might be, you always feel cheated. milos wine bar is the less opulent endeavor. there’s no view of the vessel or the hudson river; the space simply overlooks the mall’s empty interior. but the wine bar is also the more affordable and generous concept. not a single item rises above $16. that octopus the chef was grilling evidences as much technical expertise as other business-class cephalopods around town. there’s that purplish exterior, like a crisp baguette with suction cups; the middle layer of gelatin, ever-so squishy; and the meaty interior, firm and juicy. all that’s missing is that gas grill “kiss” from upstairs. here it’s $10. there it’s $32. taramasalata, a greek feat that takes briny cod roe and olive oil and transforms it into a product that’s silkier than hummus, is only available as part of a trio of spreads upstairs. the cost? thirty-nine dollars. here, it’s available alone, with warm pita, for $10. everything about the wine bar is an axiomatic argument against the absurd pricing of the main dining room.this includes the wines themselves. milos upstairs offers 11 whites by the glass, more than half of them at $17 or more. getting ahold of a waiter to order one (or a cocktail) sometimes means eating through half a $100 entree, sans beverage. but the wine bar downstairs offers at least 30 whites (and 37 reds) by the glass, with the bulk below $15; a few hover just below $10. every selection is greek, a bonus in a city where hellenic wines don’t get the representation that they deserve.it’s also a rare menu to offer meaningful tasting notes, detailing the rose-petal notes of a greek moschofilero (whose high acidity will cut through a sausage like a knife through butter) or the tropical aromas of a malagousia (whose medium tartness doesn’t obliterate the subtleties of raw tuna). the bartender will also offer pre-purchase tastes by default, a courtesy i didn’t encounter upstairs. there’s a certain irony about the whole setup: the wine bar can offer the type of service and wine selections one might expect from a fancy chef’s counter tasting, while the massive 240-seat dining room, where dinner for two can easily run $500 or more, is more akin to an economy class experience. that’s the milos money machine. if you’re a millionaire many times over, and you know precisely what to order, upstairs can be a party. otherwise, the right move is to hang out down here. here are a few notes on the menu:spanakopita: the classic greek pie, a blend of spinach, feta, and phyllo. the component flavors are stellar; the greens and feta express a vibrant sourness. but the pastry is stale.madagascar prawns: the $16 single-shrimp version of the larger $39 starter upstairs. the prawn oozes dark, heady juices when the head is removed. suck out what you can and use soft pita to mop up whatever’s on the plate. the crustacean is cooked masterfully; the salty flesh packs a welcome chew and a midlevel maritime tang.bigeye tuna: a fat slice of raw tuna on a cracker. the product is unnervingly cold, but the fault feels less egregious at $10, versus the nearly $40 option upstairs. the condiments are louder and brighter here too, with an uppercut of dill and yuzu kosho making a higher-volume, more palate-whetting amuse.scallop skewers: just three mollusks on a stick. here, they’re barely cooked through, exhibiting a precarious balance of scallop sweetness, griddle sting, and maritime brine. keftedes: veal meatballs, plain and simple. the wine bar serves them at room temp, letting the piquant, perfumey dill minced into the meat to express itself with aplomb. these aren’t ultra-juicy balls — they’re easygoing, chewy, fragrant snacks. consume with beer.\\tloukaniko: just a big griddled greek sausage. it’s everything one might expect, a chubby link that’s crisp and snappy on the outside and juicy and herby within.gyro: at $8, it’s not too much spendier than the streetside version. it was a whisper dry on a recent visit, but that didn’t detract from its overall complexity, porky crispness contrasted against slippery tomato and rich yogurt. add a hint of hot sauce and you have one of the city’s better gyros.cost: small plates at $16 or under, with many dishes at $10 or less.sample dishes: taramasalata, big-eye tuna with yuzu kosho, giant madagascar prawns, keftedakia (greek meatballs), loukaniko sausage, octopus, pork gyro, greek yogurt with honey.bonus tip: the deepest and most interesting wines-by-the-glass selection in all of hudson yards. expect about 80 different pours, with most available for less than $15.inventive, pan-regional cooking heralds a new kind of new york chinese restaurant on the upper west sidein the final decades of the 20th century, the upper west side became a hotbed of sichuan cuisine. chains like empire szechuan concentrated there, and one of our earliest sichuan chefs, wei kai chang, established himself at a restaurant simply called szechuan. so it’s not too much of a stretch that this neighborhood flourishes again as a bastion of regional chinese cooking. part of the reason is the proximity of columbia university, where asia-born students and faculty crave restaurants that provide a better taste of back home.the latest newcomer, atlas kitchen — whose website boasts “located next to columbia university” — indeed excels at not just one regional style of chinese cooking, but several. pack your bags, because we’re going on a culinary tour of china.chef kaiyuan li is a hunan native and a 20-year veteran of the new york dining scene, previously working at hunan manor. dishes from that province — where sour and spicy flavors and dried, smoked, and pickled ingredients are prized — have a major presence on the menu. sichuan food is also a frequent menu inspiration at atlas kitchen, with some dishes miraculously transformed.chef kaiyuan li and owners haocheng sun and dong chen (left to right)that old chestnut chongqing chicken — you know, the ubiquitous heap of dried red chiles and bony chicken morsels — is here improved with garlic slices, extra oil, a crispness to the chicken tidbits, and tiny twists of dough called ma hwa, which are being seen in northern chinese restaurants in flushing. and cantonese, shanghainese, and chinese-american food also appears. but li does not always stick to tradition here, often innovating on classics of the genre.situated near the corner of 109th street and broadway, the restaurant has a boxy modern premises, with murals wrapping around two walls created by famed artist qiu anxiong, who was born in chengdu. the mural is a continuation of his video animation series “new classics of mountains and seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by. the art creates a calmness in the restaurant, which mounts a menu that flies to the four corners of china for its inspiration. many say that hunan food is hotter than sichuan, but that’s not the case at atlas kitchen, though many dishes are righteously spicy. the red chiles printed in the margins of the menu are a relatively good indicator.front and center is one of the cuisine’s preeminent offerings, a humongous steamed fish head ($30.95) finished with red-hot oil, heaped with scallions and chopped chiles. the specimen is a buffalo carp, and more of the collar than usual is generously included, so diners don’t have to poke at the eyes and pull swatches of skin away from the cheeks to reveal some of the sweetest reservoirs of flesh. every morsel is delicious, and if your table is like mine, all that will be left is a heap of bones.but the best hunanese dish on the menu may be braised chicken wings, feet, and gizzards in vinegar sauce ($24.95), which rates two chiles on a menu that doesn’t confer three. it arrives in a wash of tart yellowish broth made of preserved green pepper, with, on the occasion i tried it, a chicken talon sticking out of the broth and pointing accusatorially. the chicken parts are accompanied by various vegetables. what a lovely sight! other don’t-miss hunan dishes include beef jerky, dry as driftwood yet spectacular in its addictive properties, and spicy dried tofu ($10.95), a pepper-flecked barrage of compressed tofu triangles that achieve the texture of twizzlers, served room temp.some of the options are li’s own creations, such as a plate of miniature tomatoes and blueberries dotted with dried sour plums, whose sharp, salty flavor provides a contrast to the fresher, sweeter components. his dish called beef flank in dry wok — cooked using a german stewing technique, based on his experience in that country —  is anything but dry. the small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus. one invention that doesn’t work is braised fish with perilla ($28.95). the leaves, which belong to the same family as japanese shiso, have been cooked to flavorlessness without adding much to the fish.on the sichuan side of the menu, successes include pig trotters with the meat removed from the bone and finely diced, then stir-fried with fresh green chiles. their wonderful gluey quality remains. among dishes from shanghai and vicinity is “minced beef with cilantro and egg white soup,” which represents the restaurant’s take on west lake beef soup. the shanghai soup dumplings are good here, too, thin-skinned and bulging with broth, though smaller than average ($10.95 with crab, $8.95 without).one of my favorite things on the menu is a fancified version of a classic chinese egg custard: steamed eggs with seafood ($15.95) treats a soft omelet as a seabed below an ocean of reddish, soy-based sauce in which sea creatures lurk, including squid, shrimp, white fish, and fake-crab surimi. eat it by scooping up egg, sauce, and sea denizen from the bottom with the big spoon, then plop it on your plate on a hillock of rice.on the other hand, you might want to avoid ordering rice entirely, since the menu includes two great forms of fried rice. the one called yan chow is a zippy take on a southern chinese classic, rife with eggs and spam. a hunan fried rice is also available, shot with long beans, char siu, and fresh red bird chiles. one of the most intriguing regional dishes comes from dongbei in the far northeast, where sweet and sour was supposedly invented. fried pork in scoop ($16.95) is a ball of pork fried with a very thick and unabashedly sweet crust. while perhaps reviling its sweetness, you’ll adore every bite.atlas kitchen heralds a new type of chinese restaurant in the city, one with a seasoned chef willing to take risks, while selecting favorite dishes from all over china. heck, there’s even a page called american style, which includes such classics as beef with broccoli and kung pao chicken. it serves to restore chinese-american food to its rightful honored place among chinese cuisines.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, two main dishes, fried rice, a shared dessert, and pot of tea, including tax but not tip, $95.sample dishes: potherb mustard bowl, steamed fish head, hunan fried rice, fried pork in scoop.what to drink: this place is not fooling around when it comes to tea, and distinguished tea is not cheap. small pots of tea served in ornate pots average $10, but in the chinese tradition, water is added continuously to the pot, so the tea becomes weaker as the meal progresses.bonus tip: put together as large a table of diners as you can, because choosing among the many beguiling dishes will be less difficult. in addition, large parties are allowed to sit in the raised rear room, which provides views of the entire restaurant.three stars for biryani darbar, which offers a stunning lineup of 15 biryanisno dish, except possibly the dosa, is as popular as biryani in jersey city’s india square — a two-block stretch of newark avenue that descends from kennedy boulevard to a tangle of highways on the edge of the meadowlands, and a three-block hop from the journal square path station.six restaurants in india square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. it’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to india with the muslim mughal empire in the 16th century. many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern india, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.my favorite place to score biryani in india square is currently biryani darbar. over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear. the menu offers a breathtaking 15 biryanis, but don’t prepare yourself for a visual extravaganza: if set side by side, they wouldn’t look all that different. i’ve tried 10, and all arrived in a deep, bone-colored bowl heaped with brown, white, and orange rice, surmounted by a boiled egg, cilantro, and a few rings of sweet purple onion. each vessel was voluminous, enough to satisfy two or three diners.don’t be fooled by the uniformity of appearance: the biryanis here taste distinct, though subtly so, presenting a swath of styles. the variations originate both in hyderabad and in nearby vijayawada, two cities where a tooth-and-nail competition over biryani has been raging.some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the hyderabadi style. the flagship of this fleet is hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern indian biryanis.other versions of the hyderabadi style deploy goat, mutton, ground mutton, shrimp, indo-chinese chile cauliflower, paneer given a smoky flavor by being pre-cooked in the tandoori oven, and boiled eggs. the egg version makes a particularly good brunch dish along with a cold beer on weekend afternoons, when biryani darbar’s dining room fills up with shoppers who have come from all over northern jersey to buy south asian groceries, sweets, and jewelry.the final three biryanis on a menu created by owners fahad kolani and john sehpur, plus chef ravi rajendran, are attributed to the vijayawada style, and you can tell the minute you look at them because the rice is darker and richer tasting. the one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern india. “but it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” kolani cautions. “it’s more of a green pickle gravy. it shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern india.”finally, when the version known as vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices. (kolani — a jersey guy who grew up with hyderabadi parents — explains that vijayawada biryani involves mixing pickled ingredients and pungent gravies into the rice at the last minute to make the flavor more intense.)that said, biryani darbar has a much more ambitious menu than just its eponymous dish. the bill of fare includes several indo-chinese recipes, a full selection of tandoori-baked meats, and northern mughal vegetable standards like saag paneer and aloo gobi, in addition to a slew of specifically hyderabadi specialties. street-food staple chicken majestic ($10.95) is one of those, coarsely shredded and breaded poultry in a lively yogurt sauce colored bright yellow by turmeric. it could become your favorite fried chicken.the menu is also loaded with vegetarian stuff, including gutti vankaya, baby eggplants with a stuffing of coconut, peanuts, tamarind, garlic, ginger, and assorted spices. the filling tends to escape and threatens to drown the eggplants. is this a defect? not really, because as with southern mexican moles, the sauce is the thing — the more the better. another intriguing vegetarian dish is methi malai muttar ($9.95), which finds peas dunked in a forest-green fenugreek sauce. if you’ve ever wondered what fenugreek tastes like, this is your best chance to find out.yes, biryani darbar is a great all-around indian restaurant, and a good place to discover some of the non-vegetarian south indian staples that are harder to find in the nyc area, like the aforementioned chicken majestic and the spectacularly sour gongura mutton curry. but your exploration should begin with one of the restaurant’s superb biryanis from hyderabad or vijayawada.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, one bread, and one biryani, plus tax but not tip, $50.sample dishes: goat paya (goat’s foot soup), chicken majestic, hyderabadi chicken dum biryani, gutti vankaya (stuffed eggplant).what to drink: buttermilk, masala soda, chai (sweet or unsweet), and mango and salt lassis are all offered, but i prefer good old jersey city tap water.bonus tip: don’t neglect the breads, from a fulsome roster that includes flaky lacha paratha, poultry-stuffed keema naan, and fruit-and-nut-studded kashmiri naan.david chang’s newest restaurant, under chef eunjo park, is a bright spot in the mall’s otherwise bleak dining landscapeany acolyte of gallic gastronomy knows that a fine way to celebrate the unctuous bliss of shellfish is to gel it. thomas keller devotes nearly 400 words to the complex technique in his seminal french laundry cookbook; the late joël robuchon, in turn, practically fueled a worldwide empire with his lobster gelee, setting it in clear jars as if it were a fabergé egg. any adherent of korean cuisine, however, knows that an easier but no less stunning way to achieve this effect is to throw a few raw crabs in soy sauce, let them marinate for a while, and then eat them raw. this is called ganjang-gejang, and to consume it means to experience the pure, unadulterated jelly of the sea.it’s not a dish that has achieved the ubiquity of uni or fluke ceviche. if you’re enjoying raw soy crab in the five boroughs, odds are you’re dining at a select group of rustic korean spots. the slithery meat hasn’t regularly found its way onto brasserie shellfish plateaus — or into the city’s thriving community of more creative korean hangouts. in fact, when south korean first lady kim jung-sook visited the big apple in 2017, she jetted over her own ganjang-gejang for a dinner in flushing, claiming, correctly, that its availability was limited in the u.s.enter eunjo park. the chef, who grew up in seoul, runs kawi, the most resolutely korean member of david chang’s internationalist momofuku empire. she is here to give us dry-aged steaks, pricey wagyu rice cakes, and a high-profile platform for that crab.she prepares the meat classically, letting female crabs soak in soy before chopping them into quarters. the flesh itself is translucent. it dissolves on the tongue like hot bone marrow — except the crustacean is cold, salty, and sweet, with a delicate tidal whiff. koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel. this all begs for crisp sheets of gim (dried seaweed), which are provided for making wraps. but really, the main event here is a singular one, and that is sucking out the meat from speckled oceanic appendages.the raw crab is above; below, eunjo park works the pass at kawimodern korean food is new york food — no less so than any pastrami hut, trattoria, sichuan spot, or south american food hall stall. the movement isn’t dependent on the momofuku brand for legitimacy; it’s already thriving across the city, at packed venues like haenyeo, cote, oiji, atomix, her name is han, soogil, hanjan, and too many others to list. but the addition of kawi to the ranks certainly doesn’t hurt. indeed, it’s heartwarming to see a superstar operator show up to a $25 billion complex that’s become a bastion of bland steakhouses and use it to represent dishes that are still largely underrepresented, or undervalued, throughout the country’s fine dining scene.take kimbap, maki-like rice-and-seaweed rolls that are more commonly found at asian takeout spots. park goes for a bit of elevation with these, stuffing them with buttery foie gras, torched short rib, and best of all, sweet omelet chunks and dried anchovy. on the side is a two-ounce tin of trout roe to amp up the umami. it’s not cheap at $50, but the mix of salt, sugars, and oceanic oils make it one of the city’s more affordably generous caviar services.new york does not suffer from a shortage of tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), but no one quite prepares a version of this delicacy like park. she pipes the tteok into a single pinwheel, pan-fries it in chile jam, and tops it off with benton’s smoky mountain ham. the net effect of this cross-cultural alchemy is a blood-red product sporting the dense chew of a firm steak, the fire of hot wings, and the complex, nutty porkiness of spanish iberico. even amid the city’s crowded korean scene, park, who’s worked at ko, per se, and the three-michelin-starred gaon in seoul, makes stunning fare that feels no less urgent.momofuku, born from an east village ramen shop in 2004, now boasts 11 restaurants on two coasts, with outposts in sydney and toronto to boot. expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen nobus across the world. chang has avoided this conundrum so far. as he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from paul carmichael’s caribbean-pacific tastings at seibo in sydney to max ng’s singaporean-accented dishes at ssäm bar.times critic pete wells touched on these themes in a fine essay from last year, but a significant question remained: would momofuku be able to keep up the creativity after taking on an infusion of funds from rse capital? apparently, yes. just as chang has lit gustatory fires in sleepy hotels and casinos, the two restaurants he’s opened in posh shopping centers this year — not exactly paragons of innovation — have been as interesting as anything from his early east village days. kawi has some of the strongest flavors and spice levels of any momofuku. park deploys a sweet pepper sofrito to tame the funk of tiny raw clams — but only barely. she sends out spicy tuna kimbap that packs a level of heat more characteristic of a competitive eating contest. but because this wouldn’t be a true chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. she tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. at the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top. the layering of crunch, sweetness, silkiness, and slipperiness, all in one bite, with a yuzu perfume to boot, is as good as any jean-georges vongerichten masterpiece. call it tofu brulee.the setting for these indulgences is nothing too spectacular, and that’s not a problem. chang has never been about vistas. kawi is simply a windowless room filled with dark woods, soft banquettes, and classic rock. there is no view of the vessel, thank goodness, only a view of what matters: the open kitchen, where park wields a blowtorch with aplomb.the fact that there hasn’t been much debate over kawi’s prices likely constitutes a minor victory, or a least a dose of hope for a pantheon of immigrant chefs who have struggled with the burden of being viewed as cheap. one of the longstanding riddles of the culinary world is that the chief difference between an order of dumplings and a plate of ravioli is 10 bucks.but things are changing. in an era when korean tasting menus can command $700 for two, it’s perhaps not surprising that rice cakes, which typically run $13 or so, can scratch at $40 after tax and tip here. tableside service is included. a server drops by to dip into your wagyu ragu with golden shears. he takes each tteok, as long as spaghetti, and snips it into bite-sized gnocchi. the creaminess of the cake achieves a symbiosis with the savory meat gravy. kawi makes its own rice cakes using an extruder; most restaurants buy theirs, and the result is a product that’s softer, lighter, and more tender than elsewhere. that process costs money, but in an exorbitant mall, it’s worth not overlooking value. inasmuch as chang complains about overpriced pasta, most italian spots are nice enough to do half portions for a lower prices. the giant wagyu ragu could, at $35, could easily be downsized. same goes for the cakes coated in parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites. even the chilled chickpea noodles are expensive by any standard; one dips the firm pasta into a cool pool of sesame sauce, making for an excellent spring tsukemen of sorts. this easygoing dish runs a steep $28.the real deal at kawi, however, however, is the chicken for four. park slowly roasts a breast, skins it, and lies it over rice noodles for a warm, comforting feast. in a separate bowl sit all sorts of wings, drumsticks, thighs, and errant pieces of skin. they’ve been fried, sans batter, for a pure chicken crunch. a generous sprinkle of togarashi adds just the right amount of salt and heat. at $67, the dish is easily chicken for two, with enough leftovers for days.there is no printed dessert menu the kitchen uses the power of sound to market its signature sweet. anyone who sits near the chef’s counter will hear the soft thumping of the bingsu machine, the korean term for kakigori. the pulsing is soothing and repetitive, not unlike windshield wipers. ice piles high in a wooden bowl, which a chef squirts with syrup and whipped cream. the flavors here are subtle and almost monochromatic. you dip your spoon into the volcano-shaped dome, retrieve a mass of snow, and let it dissolve on the tongue into pool of warming ginger. it’s tempting to wish kawi was literally anywhere else, but if it can act as a calling card for modern korean, a beacon for tourists who might not have otherwise engaged with it, this restaurant is arguably right where it should be.cost: about $100 per person or more. small plates — chicken wings, fried cod with yuzu — are $12 to $17; raw fish is $18 to $34; larger plates, including steaks, rice cakes, kimbap rolls, and stews, run $27 to $60.sample dishes: soft tofu with salmon roe, raw clams with sofrito and chile, raw marinated crab, wagyu ragu, chilled chickpea noodles, rice cakes with chile jam and benton’s smoky mountain ham, boiled whole chicken, bingsoo (korean shaved ice).\\xa0bonus tip: don’t sleep on lunch, the only time to sample the rice cakes with benton’s ham. a midday meal will give you enough time to hit up peach mart next door before it closes; try the black sesame and butter sandwiches, or stuff a collection of asian candies (including hi-chew) into a long takeaway tube.disclosure: david chang is producing shows for hulu in partnership with vox media studios, part of eater’s parent company, vox media. no eater staff member is involved in the production of those shows, and this does not impact coverage on eater.the second new york iteration of david chang’s flagship is the best addition to the time warner center in over a decadethe most exciting meal of julia child’s life, by her own account, was a 1948 lunch of dover sole meuniere. served at a small auberge in normandy, the fish came in a “sputtering” butter sauce, while the delicate flesh exhibited a “light but distinct taste of the ocean,” she wrote. nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of european and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era. wait captains normally debone the fish tableside, pair it with a restrained sauce, and sometimes toss in a few capers.the restaurants selling these skinless fillets — inevitably starchy institutions with continental overtones — will charge anywhere from $62 to $100. it is a very pretty dish. usually.one wonders what child would’ve thought of the version at david chang’s slyly thrilling momofuku noodle bar in midtown. alongside the porky ramen, chickpea soft serve, and frozen banana daiquiris, there is a dover sole that has evolved — or devolved — a touch more than others. it is neither delicate nor pretty. no tableside service here. patrons watch as cooks, under the aegis of chef tony kim, unceremoniously griddle the sole, pressing a weight against it for a hard sear. waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. the flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. it doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. it is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. the cost is just $43 here at the time warner center, home to the city’s densest collection of offensively priced restaurants. it’s as if chang is saying: “we can cook with the same obvious luxuries as our neighbors, do more with them, and charge less.” not bad for a chain restaurant on the third floor of a shopping mall. chang, who rose to celebrity status as an expletive-spewing chef bent on dressing down fine dining and subverting culinary traditions, is not an empire builder in the typical sense. he doesn’t xerox fine dining temples like the late joel robuchon or overpriced steakhouses a la wolfgang puck. almost all of his sit-down concepts are genuinely unique, from seiobo, a caribbean-australian tasting counter in sydney, to nishi, an asian-italian pasta place in new york, to majordomo, an haute-rustic hotspot in los angeles. but noodle bar — along with his fuku fast-food outlets — appears slated for interplanetary replication. chang runs three of them, in the east village, time warner, and toronto, or arguably four, as the las vegas momofuku borrows heavily from the chain’s repertoire of ramen, pork buns, and fried chicken. given how much culinary risk chang takes elsewhere — not to mention that fact that his venture capital backers will likely want a return on their investment — it would be understandable if noodle bar turned out to be the chef’s carbon-copy money maker. and yet that appears not to be the case, at least not here. caviar chicken buns at noodle barthis midtown momofuku has forged an identity of its own, embracing the sterile mall as much as its international eclecticism and somehow maintaining its soul throughout. across from a bose store, a j.crew, and a bland brasserie — a commercial cul-de-sac that’s barren after 8 p.m. — noodle bar teems with life. the long bar, cramped booths, and open kitchen evoke a packed 24-hour diner. patrons dunk squishy hot pocket-shaped buns into pools of jus; it is a french dip for the future, with the muscular beef concentrate magnifying the oomph of the soft brisket stuffing.an electric sign, equipped with flapping panels like the grand central train departures board, advertises nightly specials. if the buttery gulf shrimp over rice appear, order them; the viet-cajun dish, a hat tip to the houston upbringing of sous chef gary ly, bursts with old bay, cayenne, shallots, and cilantro. beef katsu, in turn, pays homage to nearby japanese izakayas. the kitchen coats a rib in panko and deep-fries it, imparting the tender, musky meat with a distinct crunch. just when things get too rich, an agrodolce steak sauce slices through all the bovine fats with the aplomb of a-1. and next door at lunchtime, cooks shave gochujang-laced pork into soft rounds of bang bread, a hat tip to midtown’s streetside pita vendors.these creations, while not chang’s per se, are still classically changian, which is to say globally curious yet laced with strong american and asian leanings. a few of the specials, however, seem designed as affordable odes to the luxe mall itself, a bastion of oligarch-ian indulgences. thomas keller’s per se charges $125 for its black truffle tagliatelle. noodle bar, by contrast, is planning to offer a spectacularly earthy tartufo nero ramen, likely for about $49.oodles of time warner spots levy $95-plus for caviar. noodle bar commands a more reasonable $28 for fried chicken buns, where the crispy meat gets a saline kick from a generous shower of smoked trout roe — a break from noodle bar’s $500 version of this dish that has heaps of black caviar. no, it’s not the same thing, but since many can only afford one of the above, the adaptation is an important one.and while masa upstairs is famous for its $68 white truffle ice cream (that comes on top of a $595 menu), noodle bar charges just $29 for something quite similar. kim shaves a flurry of the fragrant tubers over hozon soft serve, a soy-free analogue to miso. the flavor is pungent at first, then salty, then sweet. it is, like so many other dishes here, an axiomatic argument against the exclusionary pricing that pervades so much of this shopping center.folks might also try the ramen here, even if it’s not always on par with that of competing venues in nearby hell’s kitchen. a longtime quirk of noodle bar is that the composed plates have often outperformed the titular speciality. and just as dover sole is not replicated in its usual form here, momofuku’s cadre of chefs shy away from classic ramen nomenclature and flavor profiles, mixing shio with shoyu and throwing in, as kim tells me, some korean sensibilities with a little extra chile.the majestic smoked pork ramen — identical to the east village original — tastes like what would happen if a cook accidentally left a bowl of spicy swine broth next to a barbecue pit. it doesn’t have the same mouthfeel as a richer paitan, but the sensation is akin to slurping up al dente noodles slicked with liquid bacon.garlic chicken ramen, in turn, conveys salty warmth, with cubes of rotisserie thigh packing a lot more flavor than the neutral, egg-enriched broth. it’s fine, which is more than what one could say about thin beef soup (a skip). until the black truffle ramen arrives, the bacon-y smoked pork ramen is the move, as is a pile of chile-laced cold noodles. for dessert, diners can order that white truffle soft serve, or go for the frozen dairy alone. the kitchen also runs a special of pork fat-griddled bang flatbread, sprinkling the pita-like rounds with a coarse cinnamon-sugar blend. the end product, which looks like a floppy frisbee, recalls a smokier version of those doughy auntie anne’s dessert pretzels that humans rely on to keep blood insulin levels up during marathon mall sessions. therein lies the brilliance of noodle bar. even though it manages to be a unique chang-brand restaurant — and a venue that self-knowingly chuckles at the surrounding haughtiness — it still has fun riffing on the fact that it’s just a place to eat while shopping.cost: steamed buns at $8 to $13; small plates at $10 to $23; and noodles at $16 to$19. oxtail with rice cakes is $32; whole dover sole is $43. sample dishes: beef dip buns, fried blue prawns with sichuan spices, smoked pork ramen, chilled spicy noodles, beef katsu special, chickpea hozon soft serve, cinnamon- and sugar-coated bang bread.bonus tip: don’t sleep on the large-format oxtail with rice cakes and buttered rice; the rich, meaty, gravy-slicked stew is a solid way for a party of two or three to fill up without breaking the bank.sign up for our newsletter.chef stefano secchi’s pasta tasting has the ingenuity of a great omakase and the soul of italy’s emilia-romagna regionto fully appreciate the $90 tasting menu at rezdôra, an ode to emilia-romagna via gramercy park, it pays to understand a thing or two about pacing and progression in high-wire gastronomy. at a proper fine dining establishment, the kitchen never sends out a fat slice of wagyu or butter-poached lobster as a first course, nor does a tasting of yakitori or korean barbecue typically begin with the namesake items. a chef likes to whet the palate with a starter or two before moving onto more substantial fare, as a series of energizing coming attractions precedes a good action flick at the movies.but at rezdôra, things are more direct. the tasting is just pasta. that means no fanciful appetizers, intermezzos, or, as is the case at babbo, passionfruit dessert spaghetti. the night begins with noodles and, unless you order a lousy gelato or olive oil cake, the evening ends with noodles.mortadella-stuffed tortellini, each no bigger than a wedding ring, float about in a cloudy broth of capon (a castrated male chicken). the saline and sausage notes spark one’s appetite. that’s followed by maccheroni con pomodoro, wherein a bit of parmesan imparts a zippy tomato sauce with a round, msg-like savoriness. the feast crescendos with a fistful of ethereal tagliolini al ragu — more on that in a bit — and then finishes with anolini, little ham-stuffed ravioli covered in parmesan fondue. a server drizzles 25-year balsamic all over them, a dark, agrodolce counterpart to the stark white sauce. it’s not quite dessert, but it’s enough of a cheese course to serve as the meal’s logical coda.a pasta tasting, at its worst, is a gut bomb of a meal, but here at rezdôra, the format recalls the lightness and ingenuity of a sushi omakase. that is to say: each course is just a few bites, with subtle variations in richness, umami, and acidity expressing themselves within the confines of a form that might otherwise seem repetitive to a casual observer. chef stefano secchi’s ability to make this feel like a complete meal, with all its fluctuations, suggests he’s only beginning to show off his true potential.rezdôra, which also offers a la carte selections under $30, marks a vital moment in the state of new york italian dining. it represents a rare high-profile big apple restaurant led by a noted alum from osteria francescana. that three-michelin-starred temple in modena, led by the charismatic massimo bottura, is famous for its avant-garde approach to the foods of emilia-romagna. think: a lemon tart that recalls a jackson pollock painting, or a dish called “eel swimming up the poe river,” which bottura claims is “both recipe and fable.”alas, the only real resemblance rezdôra bears to francescana are the whimsical names of certain dishes. there’s “cow grazing in emilia” for a simple course of creekstone beef. the cut sports a straightforward bovine punch and a neat little herb salad. “grandma walking through forest,” in turn, is the long-winded moniker for green cappelletti. the noodles, which look like the cute conical hats that robin hood wore in the 1973 disney cartoon, are topped with verdant spring peas, stuffed with sweet ricotta, and placed atop an earthy mash of black fungi. this is your salad course.if francescana is all about modernism, rezdôra leans more smartly classical. this jibes with new york’s larger gastronomic pulse, which tends to favor technique, regionalism, culinary straightforwardness, and sleepy steakhouses over chemistry-like wizardry. but neither that reality nor the generic design of the dining room — plank floors, exposed brick, cramped two-tops, a white marble bar — detracts from the precise rustic cooking that occurs here every night.when one thinks of emilia-romagna, a northern italian region that lies between the po river and the apennine mountains, staples like parmesan, prosciutto di parma, mortadella, truffles, and ragu bolognese come to mind. rezdôra delivers on all these fronts — and with more refinement than at, say, michael white’s osteria morini, which pledges allegiance to the same region.clockwise, from upper left: stracciatella with vignola cherries, sirloin with herb salad, gnocco fritto and cured meats, and cappelleti with spring peas and black mushroom pureea charcuterie board will deliver all of the above in one fell swoop, but the gnocco fritto is the smarter delivery mechanism for these delicacies. golden orbs of pita-like puffed bread sit below piles of salumi, their nuttiness heightened by the warmth of the boulangerie. emilia-romagna is also known for its insanely plump vignola cherries, which stecchi pairs with a sufficiently milky (and tiny) pile of stracciatella.one could go on about those dishes, or the softly braised rabbit, matched with glazed veal sweetbreads. really, though, the primary purpose of a trip to rezdôra is pasta. about four portions make a light meal for two. order any of them, from the spaghetti vongole, slicked in a clam sauce as concentrated as a quart of boiled ocean water, to the infrequently seen doppio tortelli. the latter holds salty prosciutto and oozy parmesan foam in two separate “tubes.” eating one, slicked in truffle butter, is like chomping on an italian riff on a soup dumpling; when bit, it squirts out warm sauce with abandon.now let’s talk about that ragu. though often considered a straightforward dish, ragu famously became an exercise in the avant-garde with bottura, who once asked “could a plate of tagliatelle [al ragu] be at the vanguard in the same way as an abstraction of parmigiano-reggiano?” his restaurant elevated the staple by cooking the meats — which include beef cheek and veal tail — sous-vide for 24 hours, and it became one of his best-known dishes. anyone who’s fallen in love with the cooking of bottura will want to know how rezdôra compares.secchi’s recipe is different. he simmers a blend of soffrito, pork shoulder, mortadella, ground pork, and salumi for eight hours with parmesan sachets. when a patron orders the tagliolini, the kitchen emulsifies it in just a hint of tomato sauce and extra-virgin olive oil. the cooking is finished in the sauce itself. the same could be said of any pasta, but what makes that technique so powerful here is the thinness of the tagliolini. al dente isn’t the point. these are softer and stretchier, closer to the texture of rice vermicelli. they’re designed to absorb that wonderful ragu. some nights the sauce is thicker and pinker; other evenings, the slurry is looser. but on each visit, the ragu — smooth and devoid of coarse chunks — exhibits nuclear-level meatiness. one doesn’t necessarily taste the flavors of the component salumi; the experience rather conveys an otherworldly level of carnivorous umami. it will make your gums tingle. however rustic its sheen, the dish is as worthy of worship as any of the painterly creations coming out of the kitchen at atomix.the same, alas, cannot be said of the sweets. gelati, from pistachio to stracciatella, sport a thin, almost icy texture and forgettable, saccharine flavors. in a city with so many good ice cream purveyors, secchi should just ditch his product, which wouldn’t pass muster at a 7-eleven. generically soft olive oil cake, about on par with something from entenmann’s, gets the job done with mediocrity, as does a passable tiramisu. this is a bad dessert program. better just to leave here dreaming of that ragu and relishing in the fact that despite the city’s ultra-crowded italian scene, rezdôra already ranks near the top.cost: starters at $19 or under; pastas at $19 to $24; mains at $28 to $31; tasting menu at $90. expect to spend about $100 per person or more after

than ever, but eric ripert and maguy le coze’s theater district icon remains essentialsalmon, in its common new york form, is decidedly unluxurious. diners more frequently encounter it as a salad protein than as an haute menu item. new york magazine’s adam platt once quoted a companion calling it the “cheerios of restaurant food,” before adding that it was “predictable” and “useless” to critics. in fact, the last time pete wells positively used the word salmon in one of his rare four-star reviews was in 2012, when he wrote up le bernardin, eric ripert and maguy le coze’s french seafood palace in the theater district. it was a brief mention. i will be less brief. to understand why le bernardin remains one of the city’s most thrilling and technically astute restaurants, a gem of a splurge that won’t drain the bank account as much as other fine dining institutions, do one thing: get the salmon. order it raw with moroccan seasonings. neat rectangles of fish sit on the plate like pats of creamsicle-colored butter. they melt on the tongue, releasing warming, musky notes of argan oil and cumin.order it seared, with a northern indian spice blend. slices of red-hued sea trout — part of the salmon family — nearly fall apart when prodded. they ooze fat, enrobing the mouth in a velvety slick. a dice of roasted tomatoes adds acidic relief, while coriander and garlic impart a sharp piquancy.order it in pot-au-feu. chefs place the fish in a shallow pool of water and warm it for just a few minutes, barely firming up the meat. tableside, a waiter surrounds it with a moat of veal and beef broth, then spoons black truffle butter over it. a whisper of well-done flesh acts as a counterpoint to the wobbly pink filet; its ample oils channel a mouthful of salmon roe. a dose of broth then brings a rush of meaty, earthy balance. here, the majestic fish is as luxurious as wagyu.clockwise, from top left: ran ortner’s “deep water no. 1” oil painting overlooks the dining room; executive chef eric gestel and chef eric ripert inspect winter truffles; a waiter sauces striped bass tartare; natural light floods the lounge before lunchit’s tempting to write “le bernardin has still got it,” but that’s what michelin declares, without much context, every autumn when it awards yet another set of three stars to the restaurant. the more complex reality is that new york seafood has evolved in the 33 years since maguy and her late brother, gilbert, relocated their parisian restaurant to new york. namely, there’s a heck of a lot more competition now. milos came along in 1997 with its jet set lavraki and yacht-friendly prices. marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. and in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination. scores of tiny bars, many of them in hip downtown locales, cater to a moneyed clientele seeking (endangered) bluefin in all its fatty forms. so really, how much culinary relevance can a times square-adjacent french spot flaunt as the new decade nears? a lot, as it turns out.le bernardin could keep up with any posh omakase joint on its salmon alone. the menu focuses on sustainably minded catches with a breathtaking band of textures and flavors. langoustines sport a mouthfeel that’s somewhere in between marrow and gelatin. hiramasa, or amberjack, bleeds luscious oils. and poached skate boasts the soft, ropy mouthfeel of cuban ropa vieja. ripert and eric gestel, a longtime lieutenant who recently ascended to the position of executive chef, have not served bluefin for over a decade.another plus is that the menus — $165 for four courses, $198 for a tasting, $228 for a longer meal — are more accessible than those of the city’s most vaunted sushi spots. the beverage program has a generous feel to it as well. wine director aldo sohm offers scores of glasses under $20, including a flinty skin contact grüner veltliner (sound the air raid alarms, there’s finally a natural wine at le bern), and a seven-pour pairing at just $95.the room, updated in 2012, still shimmers. a tempestuous painting of the ocean, deep green and bigger than my studio apartment, still lines the back wall. leather banquettes coddle patrons seemingly dressed for a black tie charity ball. patrons who only follow the (absurd) rule of “jackets required” will nonetheless find themselves wondering whether they should’ve donned a tux. a team of largely female sommeliers, an outlier in this male-dominant field, glide across the room with airy zalto stems and silver tastevins —  shallow cups used to check the color and clarity of wine.waiters rush to tables carrying pots of sauce. lots of sauce; up to 30 different ones on any given day. they aren’t so much a performative flourish as they are the cornerstone of any dish, conveying endless layers of aroma, acid, meatiness, and creaminess. the result is a visual style that can veer closer to “rustic shallow soup” than “built for instagram,” but none of that matters once you start eating. and slurping.any hot broth is the fine work of vincent robinson, a saucier who’s plied his craft for over thirty years here. saucing is a famously fickle aspect of gastronomy — these fragile potions can collapse if you look at them the wrong way — and yet robinson operates with the precision of a physicist working a particle collider.take that hiramasa again. it’s too rich by itself. gestel, riffing on a light japanese stew called nabe, adds tiny shrimp for sweetness and matsutake for a whiff of pine. then, a pool of lemongrass dashi amps up the entire thing — accentuating the seafaring flavor while toning down the oil.in a peekytoe crab dish, one must concentrate, almost pray, to sense the subtle coastal aromas. it needs help, just not a lot. so the kitchens adds a light shellfish sauce, with a hint of fragrant coconut curry that only seems to magically appear when you whisper the word fenugreek to yourself three times.ripert has long displayed a fascination with asia, but over the past decade le bernardin has espoused a nautical globalism rivaled only by the more casual saint julivert. in 2019, that translates as sharp, salmon-y hat tips to india and north africa. it also means a transatlantic take on the spanish speaking world. the cooks sear octopus to a bouncy crunch — nothing unexpected there. then the flavor station throws in a swatch of mole poblano, a few shoots of cilantro, and a pour of spanish chorizo sauce. the flavor is sweet, grassy, and nutty at first, before giving way to a deep smokiness. aldo then swings by with a half glass of navazos niepoort ($15), a non-fortified fino that cleanses the palate with a tongue-scrubbing yeastiness.decades before neighborhood brasseries were putting sea urchin on flatbread pizza, a young le bernardin offered it baked in the shell with its own juices. “it smacks of the sea,” craig claiborne wrote in 1986. thirty years later, le bernardin continues to embrace strong flavors, sometimes dipping into levels of heat, oil, and funk uncommonly seen in even new tasting menu spots.take the geoduck, a staple at cantonese seafood spots but rarely encountered at ritzy french hangouts. le bernardin slices the phallic shelled beast into paper-thin rounds. this past august, it arrived simply with a few slices of cucumber and jalapeño. the mollusk snapped with a scallop-like sweetness, before exuding a tang that recalled fresh clam washed in tidal foam. and then the chile kicked in, jolting the palate with a capsaicin kick that would be aggressive even by hot wing standards.toward the end of the meal, a server brings over the surf and turf of the century: a cube of wagyu and another of hawaiian walu. the steak expresses a level of beefiness that recalls a shake shack burger, while the texture mimics that of silken tofu. the walu, improbably firmer than its bovine counterpart, packs luscious oils and grill char; it is as delicious and complex as a slab of more regal tuna belly.if only the calamari had as much pep and zip. stuffed squid with romesco shows didn’t rise above the level of a similar, cheaper dish at a tapas bar. just the same: the caviar atop tuna carpaccio exhibits such a mild flavor one could eat it and not know it was caviar. that miss would likely feel tougher on the four-course menu, where it commands a $50 supplement. and while i’ve never had an a la carte dinner here that was anything less than outstanding, the laws of percentages dictate that the sting of a flop is felt more greatly over a shorter meal.keep in mind that le bernardin’s waiters can operate with a retro formality that doesn’t always keep pace with the modern food or uber-cool wine service. staffers might apply the honorifics “monsieur” and “madame” with such frequency — more so than anywhere i’ve dined in the francophone world — that you half expect a singing tea kettle and dancing candelabra to accompany the desserts. appropriately, those sweets are as playful as a cartoon.pastry chef thomas raquel, taking inspiration from the trompe l’oeil works of albert adria, will trick you into thinking there’s a real apple on your plate. there is not. instead, raquel surrounds a core of apple confit with brown butter mousse before hand painting and glazing the sphere to look like a tiny mcintosh. the feeling of cutting into fruit and finding cream is a dream that every child on earth should one day experience. as for the mignardises, the chocolate dome tastes like a junior mint and the pate de fruit packs so much tart passionfruit one wouldn’t be faulted for mistaking this as a sour patch kid. the lesson, of course, is that majestic dishes don’t have to be stereotypically fancy or mild to reach their apex. sometimes, you can get by with salmon.cost: dinner at $165 for four a la carte courses (three savory), $198 for a seven-course tasting ($293 with wine pairings), $228 for an eight-course tasting ($373 with pairings). there is also a $170 vegetarian tasting menu. lunch is three courses (two savory) for $93. diners in the lounge can order a $60 city harvest three-course menu.sample dishes: langoustine with seaweed matsutake salad and dashi; peekytoe crab cake with sweet curry sauce; faroe islands salmon with black truffle pot-au-feu; hiramasa with lemongrass-infused bouillon; octopus with chorizo and mole sauce; hawaiian walu with japanese wagyu; apple with brown butter mousse and armagnac sabayon.bonus tip: reservations can book up at least a month out, but the full dining room menus, including the tastings, are available to walk-ins at the bar and lounge.london-based group rhubarb’s new york city debut goes wrong at every turn with frankenstein fusionsomething unusual happened during a recent visit to wild ink, a restaurant whose lounge offers bucolic vistas of a louis vuitton store across the hallway. my server suggested a few dishes on the asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” it was a curious statement. i hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness. the waiter simply felt the need to warn me, preemptively, that a signature preparation was garbage.so i did what any other normal diner would’ve done. i ordered them.three little empanadas, filled with marinated beef, arrived minutes later. i winced as i took a bite. chefs infuse the meat with inhumane levels of sugar and salt; if the kitchen had any sense of balance, the meat might be accompanied by kimchi or lettuce wraps to keep the seasonings in check. instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. it turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. in place of classic bulgogi, diners are treated to a veritable frankenstein of a dish, an unholy triad recalling microwaveable hot pockets, airline korean food, and hospital-quality welsh rarebit. the bartender asked me how i liked them.consider this review to be more honest than whatever my reply actually was.wild ink is a wild trip of a restaurant. the 175-seat space is located on the fifth floor of hudson yards, a shiny new manhattan neighborhood that recalls the sterile dystopian metropolis of demolition man. the sound system blasts the type of mac miller remixes one might expect to hear at a times square h&m. cooks and waiters sauce dim sum themselves, as if they were omakase sushi chefs priming each morsel for perfection. the unfortunate result is that the dumplings turn to mush.sometimes hosts don’t greet you because they’re staring down at their phones. in fact, managers can be so unaware of things that one night, a touchscreen menu outside inadvertently displayed an unlocked version of the resy table-booking service, displaying the names of the guests and their phone numbers to anyone who clicked through. at least i got to search my pseudonyms!if there were anything to get truly excited about, it was that wild ink marked, for a brief time, the new york return of tien ho. when it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than ho, whom wild ink’s london-based parent company, rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. the chef helped bring david chang’s momofuku ssam bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing korean, french, american, and japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. he followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at ma peche and montmartre. and then he suddenly left the world of day-to-day cooking, taking corporate gigs at whole foods and morgans hotel group.the scene at wild ink, plus lamb momo and mapo tofu dumplingsat hudson yards, his official title was culinary director for rhubarb u.s., the local outfit of the british-based group famous for its insipid restaurants and catering venues. just as his old boss, chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. he had been working for “several months” with the wild ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, rhubarb and ho announced they were parting ways. it just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” ho said. the fact that wild ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef peter jin. the point of this sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. the wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.the mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. the same can be said about general tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the cantonese-american staple.there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fusing diverse cuisines, experimenting with classics, or upscaling rustic preparations; ho was once a master of this. these techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. but the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. it’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or cheesecake factory.like, did jin really have to fry bulgogi and mapo into “this-won’t-stain-your-shirt” finger food? does a shumai dumpling really need so much bacon that you can’t taste the overcooked shrimp? does cold chinese celery need to be turned into yet another bland “add-seared-tuna” salad? is it not completely mental that this is the only restaurant serving chinese food in a brand-new neighborhood?perhaps most frightening of all is that wild ink appears as crowded — if not more so — than chang’s much better kawi on any given night, with revelers knocking back bland matcha vodka mules and munching on celeriac root skewers as undercooked as raw potatoes.if someone does drag you here, the beef tartare is simple and excellent, with cool chunks of beef lit ablaze with hot mustard. crab rangoon boasts a clear shellfish aroma and a remarkably light fry. yuzu risotto is a smart bet, too. it’s a simultaneous ode to japan and italy, with the citrus cranked up to levels so insane that one could sell this dish as a scented candle. and yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. it’s a loud, beautiful creation.and roast duck is passable enough, if you can make do with the dry confit leg and sinewy breast with under-rendered fat. that’s not quite a compliment, but the preparation is more forgivable than the scallops with dal. one could imagine a genius pairing here, with the kitchen juxtaposing the creamy, earthy lentils against sweet, caramelized scallops. alas, wild ink plates such gritty legumes that they inadvertently act as an ode to the sandiness of poorly cleaned shellfish. rice pudding, too, does little for the palate.the grains, hidden under slices of mango, have been cooked into mush and chilled into a flavorless chokehold. pineapple upside-down cake, in turn, is simply a fine, forgettable riff on the midcentury classic, with ginger ice cream tempering the fruit’s sugars.wild ink poses more questions than it answers: did ho simply not monitor jin closely enough? had he lost touch with the city’s changing culinary scene following his absence? did the rhubarb folks issue a cruel clubstaurant food mandate, arguing they’ll sell better with the mall crowd? will things be this mediocre when the next rhubarb spot opens at the hudson yard observatory? whatever the answers, let me end by paraphrasing the words of my honest bartender: i can’t recommend that you eat here.cost: smaller dishes at $8-$22; mains at $25 (yuzu risotto) to $38 (bavette steak). short rib at $80; peking duck at $85.sample dishes: crispy chickpea fritters, bulgogi beef puffs, lobster har gow, snow crab rangoon, mapo dumpling, spit-roasted celeriac, yuzu risotto, coconut rice pudding with mango.bonus tip: for those who find the vessel aesthetically pleasing, wild ink’s dining room tables offer some of the most direct views.\\xa0farida serves a collection of central asia’s top dishes, from a succulent chicken kebab to flaky pumpkin pastryfarida claims to be “the first and only central asian cuisine in the heart of manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. as long as two decades ago, kosher uzbek restaurants such as the legendary taam tov flourished in the diamond district, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. i’m not kidding! though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. much more recently, quick-service central asian places have popped up, such as kebab empire in hell’s kitchen, which calls itself uyghur cuisine. but what farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service central asian restaurants are in places like sheepshead bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping casios like palmyra, kaifuem, and the original nargis, which cater to central asian and russian customers and specialize in banquets.farida is named after owner farida gabbassova-ricciardelli, who runs the restaurant along with her husband, chef umitjon kamolov, nicknamed “john.” the place lies a few steps south of the port authority on ninth avenue, far from the mass of central asian restaurants in brooklyn. but the couple opted for the midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” gabbassova-ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.it resembles neither a nightclub nor a quick-service cafe, but looks like many of the other small ma-and-pa restaurants that populate ninth avenue’s restaurant row. the dining room is deep and narrow, with an alcove in front, and a counter in back that looks into the kitchen. murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. the servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.a central asian menu similar to others in town is offered, though not as complete as those of the brooklyn plov palaces. both kamolov and his co-chef, firdavs saidov, hail from samarkand — one of three most important silk road cities in uzbekistan — while the owner is from kazakhstan, but they try to have dishes from all over central asia.each part of uzbekistan has its distinctive version of plov, the rice pilaf with arabian roots. elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of samarkand.the fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: the same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.that brings us to the kebabs. here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for central asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout russia in the 19th century. like argentines and texans, central asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. get fries or naan bread on the side.the chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.but farida is hardly a health-food restaurant. take the tashkent salad ($15), named after another of uzbekistan’s glittering silk road cities and its capital. this decidedly ungreen salad features shredded daikon radish and shredded beef, with crisp fried onion on top, bound together in the russian style with thick mayo. want something healthy? check out the mellifluous-sounding achichuk, which is mainly tomatoes goosed with fresh dill and onions. the soups are also magnificent at farida, including a meal-sized lagman with plenty of handmade noodles something like udon. there are further high points. shot with chickpeas, the oxtail stew ($21) is a version of the samarkand wedding dish, but you don’t have to be betrothed to enjoy it.farida presents a “greatest hits” of central asian cuisine, with an emphasis on uzbekistan. the food is wholesome and freshly prepared by a chef and crew that display a real zeal for the cuisine. and aside from texas barbecues, it’s your best chance to get charcoal-grilled meats that taste powerfully of smoke in “the heart of manhattan,” just as the website says.cost: dinner for two, including two kebabs, a shared bowl of lagman, an order of pumpkin manti, and a pot of tea, plus tax but not tip, $55.sample dishes: lamb rib shashlyk, crispy chuchvara dumplings, pumpkin samsa, tashkent salad.what to drink: the traditional drink in central asia is a pot of tea, available here in green and black varieties, but russian beer and tarkhun, an amazing tarragon soda, are also available.bonus tip: if you feel overwhelmed by the quantity of meat at farida, consider ordering the massive pickle plate, which features tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and persian cukes in a light pickle. it provides enough vegetable matter for several diners.the riddler and air’s earn two stars apiece for their accessible bubbly selections and stellar foodmy general advice for caviar coincides with my maxim for top-shelf champagne: don’t order either at restaurants. the only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of dom perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. to truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. it needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. a sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like air’s by ariel arce or the riddler by jen pelka, two village wine bars that make caviar and champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.there’s something particularly fancy about dropping by air’s, located in a bustling macdougal street townhouse. green palm fronds rise up from the marble bar. red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. teal lights shine behind cases of wine. and diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. but here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. the beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. and just as cookies call for milk, caviar necessitates sparkling wine to gently scrub the palate of all the oceanic salts. air’s can help in this regard, offering six champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. at the riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. true, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.clockwise, from top left: ariel arce, owner of air’s; riddler chef nikole morsink, wine director jonathan adkisson, and owner jen pelka; platters of king crab and caviar at air’sas the new decade approaches, manhattan feels more and more like a museum gift shop of basic-level fanciness: money, finance bros, tetris-like skyscrapers on billionaires’ row, wagyu-laden steakhouses, and bluefin-hawking sushi dens. that’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.air’s and the riddler rank among those venues — sort of. the interventionist methods used to produce champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” but the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. arce and pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower champagnes or other progressive wines. what makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like krug and billecart-salmon to spendier bottle selections.despite their commonalities, these are two very different venues: the riddler, which debuted in san francisco, hawks airy zalto stems on its website, while air’s sells discount caviar on its site. composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at le bernardin make up the bulk of the riddler’s food menu, but air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. one of them is très bougie. the other one is less bougie. both are quite good.shortly after opening, air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. that translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “our goal is to expose as much champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” arce, a hell’s kitchen native, told eater a few years back. accordingly, a jacques lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “queen bae beyonce chardonnay,” per air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.like terroir in tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. it explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. air’s is correct here: the faint sweetness in the rose champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. and whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a j.l. vergnon murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. the pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. the eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from southern u.s. waters. the delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. clockwise, from top, all from the riddler: a shellfish platter with shrimp and hamachi; white truffle risotto with parmesan; and the dining room during service“we want to be a neighborhood spot that people can come to a couple times a week. that’s why we’re doing a burger,” riddler’s founder and owner jen pelka told eater ny this year, adding: “but we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” it’s possible, of course, that pelka has a silicon valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. my first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “ask a sommelier for a 100 club scorecard to track all of the bottles of champagne you try,” the document reads. “those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” that proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from starbucks to sweetgreen, has a rewards program. but since there’s just a single bottle of champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club. that all sounds about right for a dining room with a gold-leaf ceiling.the riddler, by any yardstick, is expensive. then again, the haute-sparkling-wine stratosphere operates by its own ridiculous value equations. at any ambitious american or gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of champagne for less than $30, so the fact that pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. among those fizzy wines is a gonet-medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit lacroix.with beverages like this, chef nikole morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single champagne. it’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. but morsink, formerly at the modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.take the king crab. so many restaurants fall back on serving the regal crustacean as is, in its own shell. morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. the result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.shrimp cocktail gets a salt-and-pepper treatment, leading to a pile of barely-cooked-through shellfish with a sharp, saline punch. roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, french. morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of noel bazin brut rose ($25). white truffle risotto, at $42, will count for some as an unaffordable extravagance. but in this realm of luxury dining, it’s a heck of a deal when versions of the dish can command $135 or more. each creamy grain snaps with an al dente bite, a whiff of brown butter, a punch of parmesan, and the ephemeral pungency of pricey fungi. caviar is reliable and not too spendy. the large-beaded kaluga variety ($78) sports a soft texture and mild seafaring flavor; discard the chips and creme fraiche, which overwhelm the delicate eggs. better is the faux dessert roe. pot de creme arrives in a round tin, affirming the venue’s nouveau-patrician leanings. crunchy chocolate balls and bitter caramel sit over a layer of salted and sour vanilla creme fraiche. the riddler is far from the first restaurant to serve pretend caviar, but it might rank among the most adept; the mix of crunch, saline punch, and astringent sugar makes the frequently leaden dessert feel light, complex, and whimsical. it costs just $11, which suggests bespoke desserts are undervalued with regard to widely available wines. no matter. it’s a modest price to pay to spend another 10 minutes or so on a chic corner of the west village, with giant windows overlooking a leaf-strewn bank street.cost: champagnes by the glass at $20 or under, with at least 50 bottles under $100. caviar is priced by the half ounce and starts at $25 for grinnell, going up to $55 for siberian.sample dishes: caviar sandwich, chilled king crab with brown butter, caviar service with chips, grilled cheese sandwich with mostarda and lemon honey, assorted charcuterie.bonus tip: service can be a bit scattered in the dining room during prime time. the best seats, accordingly, are at the bar, which is conveniently located away from the drafty doorway.cost: seven champagnes by the glass at $20 to $28, with a shorter selection of sparkling wines at $14 to $16. champagnes by the bottle, while fairly-priced, mostly run $100 or more, though there are a few pét-nats in the $70 to $85 range. appetizers are $16 to 21; larger plates are $16 to $42; caviar is $78.sample dishes: kaluga caviar, king crab with almonds, shrimp cocktail, white truffle risotto, halibut with chanterelles and green shiso, pot de creme with salted caramel and crispy chocolate.bonus tip: riddler can get quite busy during prime time; those seeking a table should book ahead via resy.japanese skewers with classically french sauces reign at maison yaki, chef greg baxtrom’s second restaurant in prospect heightsthe outdoor garden at maison yaki, a french-japanese mashup in prospect heights, smells of charred meat and fresh wood. servers ferry charcoal-grilled skewers slathered with sauces that bear names like maltaise and allemande, while the backyard deck radiates the pungency of sunbaked cedar. two humans in shorts play pétanque, an old provençal game similar to bocce. they take turns throwing steel balls, politely raking the gravel after each round, sometimes hitting the back wall where tiny strings of lights intertwine with creeping vines. and then, after a few minutes, a bearded host invites them back in for dinner.on this evening, maison yaki is only a slip’n’slide short of qualifying as summer camp. and yet, the backyard acts as one of the most civilized waiting rooms in new york. fans of olmsted, a garden-equipped sister spot across the street, know a thing or two about waits and reservations. maison yaki, a casual spot where literally every dish falls under $10, improbably boasts some of the same inconveniences as olmsted, giving away its best tables a month in advance; the only availability three saturdays from now is at 10:00 p.m. but the little secret is that the kitchen serves the full menu out back. waiters balance the crispy beef tongue katsu sandwiches on ledges, right by the two pétanque courts. as i wait for a friend one evening, i order a skewer of king trumpet mushrooms a la greque; the namesake lemon-wine sauce brightens up the meatiness of the fungi. at this point, the sky is starting to darken, and i’m cooling off with a fragrant yuzu gin & tonic. in this era where even an informal dinner can be planned with the precision of a google calendar invite, and secured with the threat of a resy-backed financial penalty ($25 per person here), it’s nice to simply walk into a joint and eat standing up while playing alcohol-fueled lawn games.a patron plays pétanque; a spread of disheschef greg baxtrom, late of stone barns, has himself another winner here in prospect heights. and the good news is that the wait to dine indoors is much shorter here than at olmsted, thanks to a 50/50 split between walk-ins and reservations. kitchen counter seats overlooking the smoldering charcoals, or bar stools underneath the mini-indoor mushroom farm, turn over reasonably quickly on weeknights. evenings here trend more affordable as well. draft cocktails, including wonderfully strong manhattans and martinis, cost $9. a full meal for one — two small plates, five skewers, two drinks, tax, and tip — will run about $80, versus $115 or so at olmsted. that’s not cheap anywhere, especially not in a neighborhood where the median household income hovers around $62,000 per year. but relatively speaking, the prices are reasonable enough for a style of cross-cultural dining that doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the city. maison yaki is a cross between a french bistro and a japanese yakitori spot, and most of the time, it’s a darn good one at that. for traditional rillettes — confit meat in a jar — a thick cap of white fat helps preserve the slow-cooked proteins. but in the fanciful world of maison yaki, a layer of wasabi-ginger foam, doing its best impression of lard, sits above a mound of shredded duck leg. the frothy tweak cuts through the poultry funk with finesse.the history of french-japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. joël robuchon’s chain of l’ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. and oodles of modern japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.but yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. their cuisines are more codified. that doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. a bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-english names. the same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.what’s particularly clever about maison yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and franco-style braised artichokes.chicken breast nuggets are typically paired with wasabi at yakitori spots. here, baxtrom douses the little bites, whose stunningly squishy interiors recall ripe grapes, in sauce allemande — essentially thanksgiving gravy.this isn’t contemporary globalism; this is classic fusion. almost every japanese-leaning dish has a striking french accent and vice versa. and the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. a korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an american steakhouse. a pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. and a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. the lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest gallic seafood soups.from top left: the dining room at maison yaki; chef greg baxtrom with shiso snails; scallop skewers with sauce maltaise; max katzenberg, co-owner and general managerthat’s not to say maison yaki couldn’t use a bit of work. the kitchen doesn’t always display the same technical prowess with japanese grilling as it does with french-style saucing. this is not unexpected for a young venue. cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. watching a senior yakitori chef (or uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. they tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.the binchotan station at yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. the sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. the squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss. well, except when the meat is overcooked.you’re invited to the eater young guns summitthen there are leeks. they’re seared past the point of no return, essentially vegetarian mush on a stick. what saves the preparation is a vichyssoise sauce (a blend of potato and more leeks), adding a hit of bright, creamy buzz to the soft allium.  skewered pork belly arrives hidden underneath a foamy dijonnaise, adding just enough tang to balance the richness of the swine. if only the swine exhibited the silky fats and crispy flesh that normally make pig belly so compelling. these are simply firm, hot cubes of meat. one might logically ask about all the offal that typically define the modern yakitori spot. for now, items like gizzards and hearts only appear as specials, which is too bad because those off-cuts and viscera provide something that yaki could do better with: texture. the variegated mouthfeels one experiences at venues like tori shin — thanks to snappy knee bones and rubber band-like arteries — help break up the fact that you’re essentially eating a whole lot of hot, fatty meat. baxtrom’s old-school saucery, which harkens back to the era of careme and escoffier, serves a similar purpose, which is to achieve a sense of balance. but still, it would be nice if more of the skewers exhibited more than the soft or faintly chewy textures that dominate a meal here. there are worse verdicts, of course, than chomping down on a pillowy duck meatball. the kitchen doesn’t lace it with tiny bits of bone, as is the norm; the fluffiness puts it closer to an italian meatball than a japanese one. you dip the succulent poultry into a ramekin of soy and what looks like yolk. turns out the egg is really an avant-garde sphere of fruit puree that pops with the poke of a chopstick. “duck a l’orange,” the menu says. very cool. equally cool is yaki’s rare textural masterpiece, two chicken wings on a skewer. the skin shatters like the top of a creme brulee, while the silky flesh underneath yields with more ease. this is the appropriate way to end a meal here. baxtrom didn’t initially employ a pastry chef at olmsted, an omission he managed to pull off thanks to a masterpiece of frozen yogurt. and while there’s now a chef dedicated to sweets, the team hasn’t yet found that killer finisher here at yaki, so for now you can skip the mealy japanese cheesecake or run-of-the-mill profiteroles. those who want to extend their stay can kick the dirt out in the backyard with a martini and a few steel balls.cost: all items are $10 or less. dinner for two should run about $150 after tax and tip.sample dishes: baguette with yuzukosho butter, chawanmushi with summer truffle and artichoke barigoule, escargot in shiso butter, beef tongue katsu sandwich, asparagus with béarnaise, lobster with sauce américaine, chicken breast and sauce allemande, duck a l’orange.bonus tip: even though the best tables book out far in advance, about half the restaurant is reserved for walk-ins. waits are more reasonable than at olmsted — and sometimes non-existent in the later or early hours —\\xa0but can hit 90 minutes at prime time.update: an earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that olmsted and maison yaki do not employ a pastry chef. they now do.dennis ngo’s creative melding of vietnamese flavors and modern nyc sensibilities, along with dishes rarely served in nyc, is rightly drawing crowdsone of new york’s most exciting new dishes originates from the street vendors of dalat and ho chi minh city. there, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. this bánh tráng nướng, or vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in orange county, california, home to one of the country’s biggest vietnamese populations. but it’s been largely unavailable in new york.that changed with di an di, a greenpoint vietnamese restaurant from texas-native dennis ngo. when it opened, ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. but the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of vietnam and its american diaspora, debuted something a bit different in december.ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. and then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. the crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. the clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. the chef says the flavor combinations are true to vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of northeasterners: a new haven-style bivalve pie. the menu lists it both as a vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants di an di as a modern vietnamese-american restaurant. and it’s an excellent one at that.long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist tu mo had a few smart words about vietnamese soup. “don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author andrea nguyen. mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist french rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.nearly a century later, vietnamese spots pepper the parisian landscape. and even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in new york, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. few would consider it humble — especially not at di an di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than gallic consommes.it would be just as absurd to call the restaurant humble. patrons of all stripes line up two hours for bánh xèo — a dosa-like turmeric crepe filled with a warming blend of shrimp, pork, and mung beans; the starchy mixture is bland at first, but a quick application of fish sauce brings the component ingredients to life. other diners might reserve weeks in advance to gnaw at wonderfully chewy fried pig tails, sticky with tart tamarind chile sauce. they cleanse their palates with icy vodka highballs, redolent of lemongrass and bergamot, while sitting near neon-green lights and hanging plants.the plant-filled bar room and dining room at di an dithese are the type of fervent crowds the late pastis might have commanded in its heyday, or that momofuku might attract now. whenever an old developer stuffs his luxe mall or waterfront development full of copycat euro spots, i think about packed venues like di an di, restaurants that will define the future of the city while corporate brasseries sit fallow.humble, in fact, is not a word that would apply at all to the big apple’s rapidly evolving southeast asian scene. new york’s largest flow of vietnamese immigrants came following the fall of saigon in 1975; many of them eventually settled in elmhurst and flushing, which along with chinatown still boasts one of the city’s most notable clusterings of phở and banh mi spots. but just as a new class of korean and chinese restaurants are popping up around the city, a younger group of vietnamese venues are making a name for themselves as well, pushing past tradition and the burden of being cheap.members of this crew include bunker, backed by a queens native who dishes up bacon banh mi sandwiches in bushwick; hanoi house, which sells uni pancakes in the east village; and madame vo bbq, whose new york- and mississippi-born chefs book up the house with $59 seven-course beef tastings. di an di’s operators are second generation; ngo and kim hoang were raised in houston, home to the country’s third-largest diaspora community, while tuan bui hails from northern virginia. accordingly, they reference foods both from their vietnamese travels and their american upbringings.that means diners can expect chicken over rice, a staple dish in houston, where it’s normally steamed hainanese style. di an di instead fries the birds, letting them crisp up without any batter. the soft meat and golden skin taste like a mathematically engineered bird: poultry to the power of 100. to amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of lone star vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare new york appearance here. strands of rice paper, as wide as tagliatelle and as thin as tissue, act as springboard for a tart jolt of pickled papaya and a salty crumble of beef jerky. it is a perfect cold noodle salad.lucky guests might also encounter a steamed, grilled, and deep-fried short rib. ngo says the “entire reasoning” for this special, which packs a powerfully earthy beefiness, was to show off an even more flavor-packed product: mắm nêm. he softens the blow of that famous elixir, forged from whole fermented anchovies, with pineapples, chile, and lime juice. patrons wrap the beef in the lettuce, then dunk it in the mắm nêm, which has a stunning umami-rich pungency that more or less makes it the durian of steak sauces. and of course there’s the spring roll, a dish so ingrained in stateside culture that one can find them, for better or for worse, on a cheesecake factory menu. at di an di, the flavors seem to sing more brightly than elsewhere. the tamale-sized rice wrapper folds around a fistful of mint and basil, while a pile of shrimp and squid mimic the flavor intensity of a langoustine. new york’s modern vietnamese menus are often quite focused in their soup offerings. hanoi house offers a riff on leaner northern phở — little more than broth, stretchy rice noodles, fish sauce, and filet mignon — while madame vo reps the lusher and more common version from the south, fragrant with cilantro and accompanied by a plate of basil, jalapenos, and sprouts. di an di, by contrast, acts as an outlier in selling both. cooks cover the hanoi phở in scallions, adding a touch of perfume to the intensely beefy broth. and they serve the sweeter southern version with a plate of basil and sprouts for tearing and infusing. giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.the kitchen also puts out an estimable phở ga (chicken), with a clean poultry tang and a resinous hit of rau ram, as well as a strikingly nuanced bún bò huế, a crimson-hued soup heady with beef, shrimp paste, sweet lemongrass, and bouncier, thicker, firmer noodles.best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. this ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes di an di a vietnamese analogue of sorts to ivan ramen, one of the few japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.ngo says he plans to tweak the di an di formula as it matures, perhaps introducing a late-night program — along the lines of ssäm bar in its 2006 days, where tien ho served some of the best vietnamese-american fare the city has ever seen. and he’d also like to revisit dessert, which was nixed after an early effort to keep the tables moving. in other words, the chef is ensuring di an di can do what virtually any modern american restaurant serving any type of food needs to do to remain relevant: adapt and evolve. cost:  snacks at $5; rolls, salads, and starters at $8-$16; and phở and other soups at $14-$16. larger share plates are priced a touch higher; fried chicken and rice runs $17; turmeric crepe with mung bean is $18.sample dishes: shrimp and squid spring rolls, bánh tráng trộn\\xa0(rice paper salad), crispy pig tails with tamarind chile, bánh tráng nướng\\xa0(vietnamese pizza with shrimp floss or clams), cơm gà\\xa0(chicken with rice), bánh xèo\\xa0(crispy turmeric crepe), assorted phở, bún bò huế (spicy beef lemongrass soup).bonus tip: the short-rib special often sells out early! also keep in mind that waits can often stretch well past an hour for walk-ins; consider using the “notification” function on resy for last-minute availability due to cancellations.california’s noble attempt at sustainable meat is poorly executed, with bland burgers and underseasoned steakin the west coast meat world, few names carry the import of belcampo. anya fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. she achieves such nobility through vertical integration; belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert temple grandin. according to a new yorker feature titled “can steak save the planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. the grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” the company even holds o magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. belcampo’s east coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into new york’s meat scene. it is not. the restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of hudson yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. the concept is admittedly a welcome one here in hudson yards, a development where a single ribeye can run over $100.belcampo is where you go when you don’t have a reservation elsewhere or when the family is with you. the dining room piece de resistance is a giant glowing sign above the bar that says “belcampo.” it is a very branded ambience.this does not seem like the belcampo jonathan gold once wrote about. the late, great, pulitzer prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. other west coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. there are no such wonders at the hudson yards belcampo. this is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. this is shopping food. the standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; i recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. the progressive farm-to-table ethos does not extend to the beverages. anyone pairing their beef with a nice red will encounter a fairly generic cabernet, pinot, or syrah. it will be served warm. you will not see the bottle, never mind get a pre-purchase taste. there are no funky orange whites to pair with any of the sustainable fare.still, there are some gems. when it opened, fernald said that she expected most of her customers to be people who live and work at hudson yards. if you’re one of those people — or if you’re someone who simply ends up at the mall without a reservation — here’s a rundown of what to order and what to avoid. tartare or carpaccio: these are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. the carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. the meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. as for the tartare, it’s better than thomas keller’s more luxe version at nearby tak room. neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. duck poutine: fries get slicked in beef gravy and topped with crispy bits of duck thigh here. the flavors seamlessly align with their component ingredients. the meat is gamey. the fries are crispy — until they turn gorgeously soggy near the bottom — and the gravy is umami-rich. the cheese curds are firm and clean, providing a respite from all the salty, nourishing goodness. chicken caldo: this is a nourishing and affordable soup. for $12, you get a giant bowl of poultry bone broth laced with lime and tinged with warming achiote. heady forkfuls of shredded thigh meat float alongside big slices of avocado.tallow fries: this $12 side comes fried in either duck fat or beef fat. neither, however, exhibit the multilayered flavor profile of a proper tallow fry. they’re just run-of-the-mill, above-average frites, crispy on the outside and fluffy within.merguez sausage: juicy and smoky, the sausage boasts a clean snap. a solid $8 side.lamb burger: this is the only good burger here ($16). the lean meat isn’t as rich or silky as the famed breslin version, but that also means it’s easier on the digestive system. each bite provides a medium punch of salt and funk, while alfalfa sprouts impart a touch of pleasant grassiness. just one problem: the cooks apply so much drippy aioli that the bun instantly turns to mush. satay chicken salad: this includes smoky grilled breast meat over a pile of lettuce varnished with sweet-sour dressing. push aside the mushy cherry tomatoes. this isn’t quite an ode to the aromatic skewers of indonesia, but for mall food,it gets the job done. regular fries: underseasoned and undercooked ($6). they’re a fine advertisement for the $12 tallow fries, which are really your only option here. tallow tenderloin: tenderloin prepared correctly can be a wonderful thing. but at belcampo, the butchers’ effort to age the cut in tallow is in vain: the filet ($56) channels its reputation as the bland chicken breast of the bovine world. the overcooked interior is barely salvaged by a sticky veal reduction sauce. charcoal-rubbed ribeye: imagine the flavor of a regular ribeye, but deprived of silky fats or deep flavor ($80). my meals here were possibly the first time i’ve ever experienced a steak that’s simultaneously medium rare and dessicated. the level of salt is so high that the steak tastes cured. the exterior cap, often the most flavorful and succulent part of the steak, has been  overcooked to the point of dracarys-style carbonization. double fast: this is the restaurant’s classic double burger ($12). the kitchen manages to incinerate the meat in such a way that it’s entirely gray and overcooked within. on one visit, the exterior was bereft of a salty char, while on another, there was excellent char, but still no salt or beefiness. the dominant flavor profile is mustard.dry-aged burgers: the 28-day patty is a thoroughly average entry into the crowded restaurant-burger field ($16). the underseasoned meat isn’t quite dry, but it isn’t juicy either. a mound of caramelized onions and white cheddar provide the bulk of the flavor, while the meat itself it little different from any generic diner burger. the 100-day burger ($28) boasts almost zero dry-aged flavor. it’s just a pile of tender meat on a bun, undercooked to the point of mimicking the texture of pate. if you’re going to spend this much on a burger, go to minetta tavern. cost: most starters, bowls, and soups at $18 or less. burgers at $12 (double patty), $16 (dry-aged beef or lamb), $28 (extra-aged). steaks start at $28 and go way up from there.sample dishes: beef tartare, beef carpaccio, belcampo charcuterie, duck confit poutine, all-day breakfast sandwich, achiote chicken soup, steak frites, assorted burgers, and a lamb shawarma salad called “the vessel.”bonus tip: the right order here is an order of duck poutine and beef tartare (or carpaccio). for a classic fast food burger, the better option is shack shack around the corner.the hudson yards midcentury chophouse’s most troubling addition to new york’s dining scene is the $100 entree for oneone of the strangest moments in late-night television came in 2004, when adam sandler asked conan o’brien whether he’d been to per se. the question made a certain degree of sense; sandler played a fine dining chef in spanglish. but still, celebrities appear on talk shows to seem relatable; they don’t go on about lamborghinis or private jets. and yet here was comedy’s t-shirt-and-jeans everyman talking about one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with o’brien admitting he’d been there too. sandler even mentioned the owner’s name, thomas keller, the american godfather of the $1,000 meal.no other culinary icon is more responsible for raising the bar on how much u.s. diners pay for a single dinner. other fancy venues had four stars, but in the mid-aughts, keller had the high-end zeitgeist. he enjoyed high-profile consultancies on that sandler flick and on ratatouille. one of his top waiters penned a celebrated memoir about the nightly wizardry at per se.the coverage and reviews helped normalize feasts that could last hours and cost as much as a bi-weekly paycheck. per se’s success — the times named it the city’s best restaurant, at least for a while — fueled a new class of extended-tasting-menu spots. journalist jodi kantor argued venues like per se contributed to spendier $40 mains across the country. when keller raises prices, others follow. this brings us to the case of tak room, keller’s new endeavor at hudson yards. most of its seats are filled on any given night. its celebrity clientele has been documented by the hollywood reporter. but while it nominally specializes in midcentury fare, the true signature dish is more troublesome, both the way it’s executed and the frequency with which it intrudes upon every meal. that dish is the $100 entree. a single dish for one.the $100 entree is not an outlier at tak room, a restaurant that largely mimics keller’s surf club in miami. more than half of the mains will effectively cost that much, after tax and tip. keller is getting us to spend more, again.take the ribeye. it isn’t dry-aged, a time-consuming method that may warrant a higher cost; none of the steaks are here. it doesn’t sport the spinalis muscle, arguably the most succulent part of the ribeye, which has been butchered off for no good reason. it doesn’t even exhibit a particularly notable juiciness or beefiness. a spokesperson for the restaurant said the snake river farms cut should rank from a 9 to 12 on the japanese scale of marbling, which is about one would expect from ultra-expensive wagyu. in reality, the fattiness and flesh recalled the depth of something from costco. it costs $106 after adding steak sauce.or contemplate the prime rib. “two can share it, but it’s meant for one,” a waiter tells me. it costs $110 (or $142 post-gratuities and the like). keller himself drops by to slice it, shearing off a slab that’s as thick as a lean paperback novel. he douses the mid-rare meat in enough jus to coat every inch of the meat and the plate’s inner rim.tax and 20 percent tip have been added.lamb chops + sauce: $106ribeye + sauce: $106 dover sole:  $110lobster thermidor: $110filet mignon + sauce: $119prime rib: $142short rib wellington: $178 (for two)snake river strip steak: $206it’s a very good prime rib. the flesh flaunts a clean, iron-y tang, while the exterior shows off a beefier, and salt-and-pepper, punch. the jus is just a bit richer than elsewhere; it ties everything together with a hint of msg-style oomph. but is it any better than the more complex roast at smith & wollensky, whose dry-aging imparts a nice roquefort zing? it is not. is the service better here? during a final visit, waiters poured free wine like it was tap water, and managers, captains, and staffers practically sent me off with full military honors. and yet during my prime rib night, i couldn’t get a martini until i was halfway done with my steak. no one stopped to say goodbye as we left, $500 poorer.it might sound a bit strange to be criticizing a la carte dining in this context. the keller devotee may even argue that the chef is offering a concession to new yorkers by opening a restaurant that’s cheaper than per se.except that dining at tak room hardly feels like a low-cost gift. the beauty of a longer tasting menu like per se’s is that it allows for safe experimentation and salutary failure. nine brilliant courses will outweigh four misses. with a shorter three-course meal, though, the chef has just one shot at that main course. and the pain of that single large dud is multiplied when the price is double what it should be, a scenario that occurs too often at tak. the $100 main that’s “just okay” functions less like a psychological barrier that diners need to overcome, and more like an income test: those who can’t afford it don’t belong.if pe se, in its heyday, felt like a smart cultural investment, along the lines of box seats at the opera or a limited-run play, tak room takes on a different air. it belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. harry cipriani is the classic example, while tak, alongside neighboring estiatorio milos, are the more modern ones. the a la carte format in this case lets the 1 percent flex their wealth — amid the company of their privileged brethren — without the burden of a four-hour meal or throngs of destination diners seeking culinary enlightenment. it’s just dinner.to be fair: no one expected tak to be a cheap hangout. everything about it is grand, or at least faux-grand: its views of the hudson (for a select few guests; some seats abut service stations), the sumptuous booths, the live piano player, the crudite amuses (food critics get osetra caviar), the semi-stale candied popcorn mignardises, the sheer expanse of the venue. one could literally fit a sushi bar in its foyer and a cruise ship waterslide on its carpeted staircase and it wouldn’t feel any less roomy. the environs are about right for lobster thermidor. the kitchen lightens up the heavy classic with a foam, gruyere-lace bisque, using it to surround a silky (albeit tiny) tail and two powerfully aromatic claws. it’s essentially a large appetizer — quite nice if you have $110 to spare.thermidor isn’t the only old-school dish that appears; there’s also sauce perigourdine, avocado louis, and celery hearts victor. tak room would be well served to offer descriptions, but the only preparation to receive any type of narrative explanation is the strip steak. the large menu blurb, which is more of a sales pitch, describes the japanese-angus hybrid as “the best of both worlds,” and as a meal “for two or for one.” it is among the first items a waiter might recommend. the sixteen-ounce entree costs $206 after tax, and tip. one wishes a steak so rich could come in a portion that’s a quarter of the size — and price. but the goal here is anchoring, ensuring that high-cost dishes make all the other items seem less preposterous by comparison. perhaps the $30 eggplant parm doesn’t seem like such a bad deal in this light. until you sample it. it’s effectively a bland mash of textureless nightshade in a tomb of mozz and sandy breadcrumbs.oxtail consomme ($32) is the smarter choice. the meat’s natural gelatins cause one’s lips to stick together, while the broth itself is pure black truffle intensity. dover sole also does what it should, acting as a soft, flaky conduit for capers and lemon. still, it is little different from any other sole preparation anywhere else in town.when one thinks of tak room, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with the grill in the old four seasons space, that atavistic temple to power. the midcentury-minded spot puts quite a few mains in the $100 club. but many of the entrees fall way below that mark. and the grill casts a wider net on the past, serving up stellar fare that simply isn’t available elsewhere, from amish ham steaks to pasta with duck organ juices.tak room’s interpretation of yesteryear is narrower and more subtle; it doesn’t feel that different from most contemporary bastions of beef. steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. tableside caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. it is cold lettuce with dressing. the $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. the texture is sludge.better is the wellington for two ($138), a wonderful riff of the classic, nixing bland tenderloin for a mid-rare short rib that’s almost impossibly heady. the beef needs the pastry crust, (spongy) mushroom duxelles, and truffle sauce to keep its powerful aromas in check. too bad a smaller, more affordable portion isn’t available for less. there’s something to be said for a whole fish spot saying, “this is how big our turbot is, we only have one left, and we charge by the pound.” steaks, however, are the product of in-house butchery. a restaurant that wants to charge less can simply use a knife.keller is making a choice. he’s making a choice to charge more, just as he’s made a choice to build his more affordable and creative full-service concepts elsewhere, concepts such as ad hoc and la calenda, a oaxacan spot in napa valley. it would be a shame if the takeaway for developers was that we need more restaurants like tak room, restaurants where the $100 entree is not just a viable but a desirable goal for more owners and operators to pursue. sure, it works here. it will likely work elsewhere; there are enough bankers to charge ridiculous prices. keller knows how to issue a premium on wealthy new yorkers for fancy food. now it’s time for him to show he can do something ambitious for the rest of us.cost: easily $200 per person or more for 3-4 courses. remember that most mains are a la carte, as is typical in most steakhouses. that means an $85 filet comes with neither sauces ($6-$12) nor sides ($14).sample dishes: shrimp cocktail, oysters rockefeller, double oxtail consomme, dover sole, lobster thermidor, prime rib, short rib wellington, lemon meringue (with sulfurous meringue), creamsicle bar.bonus tip: candied bacon is the side dish of choice. think of the salty-sweet, lacquered pork belly as a mini honey baked ham for $16. also: the bar and lounge area accommodates walk-ins, and the full menu is available there.the pan-regional indian restaurant sends out homey dishes with punchthe “oohs” and “ahhs” follow dum biryani ($19) as it bobs across the room. the casserole is topped by a sheet of naan dough that imprisoned the volatile flavors as the dish baked. this sealing-in is what the “dum” refers to, in a recipe attributed by the menu to the far northern city of lucknow, india, though biryani is more often associated with the southern city of hyderabad.arriving at our table, the waiter takes a big spoon and saws the nicely browned crust with a circular motion. then he flips the flap of crust over so the steam spirals out, redolent of saffron and sweet spices. inside, rice shimmers with chunks of bone-in goat and shredded herbs. the first bite proves exquisite, especially when further moistened with the tart pomegranate raita provided.“my purpose at adda,” executive chef chintan pandya told me one evening, “is to reproduce the true taste of indian home cooking.” he continued, “i’m from gujarat and mumbai and owner roni mazumdar is from kolkata in west bengal, so we come from different places, but certain things are shared. i’m trying to cook the way our mothers did.”it’s an effort rarely found in new york city indian restaurants: not only is adda making a conscientious effort to dig into the regionalities of indian cuisine, it’s doing so with accessibly priced, homestyle fare, where all dishes fall under $20. many chefs at indian restaurants in neighborhoods across nyc adapt recipes for what they think are american customer preferences, and the more ambitious pan-regional places skew more expensive, including pandya’s greenwich village restaurant rahi. but adda does neither. and the quest to replicate home cooking at adda is, perhaps, why the dishes are a degree hotter and richer, with some ingredient choices and combinations not commonly found in other new york indian restaurants. take “seasonal saag paneer” ($15). many restaurants stick to mustard greens and spinach or substitute spinach entirely, which makes for a mellower dish. but adda’s version is composed of whatever greens happen to be in the market in the moment. the other evening, it included red amaranth leaves, produce that’s common in traditional indian cooking and now stylish in the states as an antioxidant. what’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many nyc indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. the problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.the same incredible paneer constitutes a focus of the menu. have it in chile paneer tikka ($7). here, a spicy red sauce has been painted on the grilled squares; they tumble onto the plate like paving stones. less exciting is paneer khurchan, which tosses the fresh cheese with peppers in a tomato sauce that obscures the cheese’s delicate flavor. while a few indian restaurants focused on regional cuisines have incorporated pork (prevalent in goa and karnataka) and beef (a keralan favorite) into their menus, adda sticks with the standards of chicken, lamb, and goat, which pertain in most restaurants here and in india. lamb is showcased in one special, a hulking ground-meat seekh kebab ($13) that’s an especially good deal if volume of meat is your objective.but the best dish among a dozen meat and poultry choices is a goat curry called junglee maas ($18), or “wild meat,” a reference to people cooking what they hunt. goat curries, of course, are ubiquitous at punjabi steam-table restaurants throughout the city, often in stunning renditions. adda, though, one-ups even the best of them with the junglee maas. the bones are left in, as they should be, and the gravy is at once fiery and pungent. if you love goat, this curry will drive you crazy and leave your tongue burning. other standards of top steam-table restaurants are produced here in even better renditions too, including a butter chicken so rich it boasts streaks of actual butter on the surface.offal cravers will find a pao (round roll of portuguese origin) topped with chicken livers, and a bheja fry newly added to the menu — gingery goat brains. and though meat shines here, vegetarians will find plenty to love on adda’s bill of fare, including globular lotus-root kofta akin to croquettes that rest in a tomato sauce laced with fenugreek, and a tandoori-cooked cauliflower topped with a layer of amul, a processed cheese based on cheddar that’s in the same family as velveeta. my mom would have loved it. adda lies on the border of long island city and sunnyside in an industrial neighborhood, with the 7 train clattering overhead and laguardia community college directly across the street. the inside features a counter and overhang at the rear made of corrugated tin, and newspapers are plastered all over one wall, modeled after hangouts in india. while waiting for your food, study the papers for a thumbnail history of modern india.pandya and owner roni mazumdar also preside over rahi, an upmarket restaurant in the west village that plays fast and loose with indian regional cooking, sometimes inflecting it with japanese and middle eastern twists. but the food at newcomer adda is simpler, cheaper, and less beholden to current trends demanding that the camera eats first — which is a good thing, and which evokes the kind of indian food i first fell in love with at steam tables across nyc. and in pursuing the actual home cooking of regions across india, adda gives us a new perspective on an already familiar cuisine.cost: dinner for two, including two apps, two main dishes, a bread, and two indian sodas, plus tax but not tip, $60.sample dishes: kale pakoda, malvani prawn curry, seasonal saag paneer, lucknow dum biryani, garlic naan.what to drink: you might want to try an imported indian soda like thums up or limca. currently, adda is byob, and there’s a 7-eleven with an abysmal beer selection two doors down to the east.bonus tip: one dessert is usually available, a kheer (rice pudding) snowed with crushed pistachios and cashews attributed to the owner’s father. it is excellent, but so rich that two should share.expertly executed food saves intersect by lexus from feeling like a total corporate shillon a stretch of 14th street where boutique workers on cigarette breaks sometimes seem to outnumber pedestrians, there lies a shiny new restaurant, cafe, and retail space. the first thing a prospective patron sees is a sign advertising a brownie, which is decorated with an edible symbol for lexus, the luxury automaker that encourages humans to gift other humans $75,000 vehicles for christmas.the second thing a diner sees at this venue, which serves the food of gregory marchand, one of the great chefs of paris, is a full-sized suv — an actual lexus. it sits in the lobby of this space operated by union square hospitality group’s danny meyer, a hospitality guru who likes to choose low-key names for his projects. but this restaurant is named after a car company. welcome to intersect by lexus.anyone who orders a bacon maple scone — heady with the scent of sweet pork — will have a fantastic view of a two-story wall of car parts, and a nice view of the car too. one can learn a lot about that automobile here, from an eight-panel museum exhibit in the back to souvenir cards at the cafe tables explaining how the vehicle “adheres to the japanese tradition of omotenashi, or hospitality.” information about marchand is slightly tougher to come by, which is too bad, because this restaurant sponsored by a car company happens to serve the most creatively ambitious food to come out of any meyer restaurant since gramercy tavern or the modern. one of the pleasures of dining at independent restaurants in 2019 is that they feel immune to the corporate takeover of the city, a town where cheap hot dog stands close to make way for chic juice bars. they serve as an escape from the branded experience encroaching upon so many aspects of modern american life: a president who tweets out photos of fast-food buffets; mobile ads tailored so perfectly that people have begun to wonder whether apps are listening in on our conversations.intersect offers no such escape, though the restaurant itself, located on the second floor, is free of any full-size sedans or obvious lexus paraphernalia. marchand — who helped dress down fine dining at frenchie in paris — is guest chef until the end of march. after that, another chef will take over, and then another every four to six months. therein lies what might be the upside to this type of sponsored restaurant. the fact that meyer operates it without the same financial constraints of a traditional venue, as a manager mentioned to me, means it can afford to experiment a bit more.the catalan avant-gardist ferran adrià, who operated el bulli in spain at a loss, famously toyed with the idea of a corporate-backed space. museums and opera houses have historically relied on the patronage of rich benefactors — not just ticket prices — to fund new exhibits and productions. so couldn’t the same work for restaurants if the arrangement encourages risk? if it highlights new or out-of-town talent? in theory, yes.executive chef nickolas martinez; pastry chef kazuo fujimura; foie gras with pastramimarchand — whose vision is executed on a day-to-day basis by executive chef nickolas martinez and pastry chef kazuo fujimura — crafts the type of visually stunning and modern dishes one might expect from a tasting temple charging $600 for two. here, a great meal costs about $200.the kitchen aces buttery rectangles of foie gras with long slices of pastrami, redolent with the scent of clove. smear it on a slice of sourdough, and the result is an open-faced spiced meat sandwich that would make a convert out of even the most devoted patron of katz’s. so many chefs use raw fish to show off skillful knife work — turning raw tuna into geometrically perfect squares or rectangles. marchand and martinez prefer to practice their hammering skills, pounding fluke into a carpaccio that takes up as many square inches as schnitzel. the fish is neutral and translucent; it acts as a clean delivery mechanism for salt, greens, and crispy quinoa.martinez also finds textural correspondence with a bowl of mushrooms, gnocchi, and sweetbreads. every morsel, simultaneously rich yet packed with acid, yields to a soft chew. a giant cross-section of cauliflower sits underneath a crumble of seeds, nuts, and dates. you cut it like a steak and drag the florets through a curried puree of the vegetable. and an (oversized) duck breast flaunts a sesame-honey-glazed skin that seems to shatter like candy when cut; quenelles of sunchoke puree impart a haunting smokiness. as for the desserts, fujimura serves the type of technically advanced yet delicious sweets that wouldn’t feel out of place at a three-michelin-starred spot like le bernardin, where he once worked.he takes banoffee, a dense and caloric british pie, and transforms it into a cloud, piping a dulce de leche foam over banana ice cream and compote. one doesn’t eat it as much as inhale it. and he makes a mont blanc to end all mont blancs. spaghetti-like swirls of chestnut cream surround a base of creme fraiche chantilly — nothing out of the ordinary there. but at the base is a mound of candied chestnut, an unusual addition that adds a warming, chewy savoriness. and on top of the tiny “mountain” is another twist: a dollop of yuzu-yogurt sorbet, cutting through the sweetness. it doesn’t do too much good to go on too long about a menu that will change entirely this spring, but it’s worth musing upon some larger aspects of the space — and the lexus agenda — that bode less well for sponsored culinary establishments.restaurants are many things, but they don’t historically act as lifestyle ambassadors for brands whose products many of their own patrons will never be able to afford. alas, in the past few years, new york has seen blue box cafe, which sells a $32 “breakfast at tiffany” inside the jeweler’s flagship, and la mercerie at roman and williams guild, where hosts advise guests to browse a store selling $16,000 couches.the self-proclaimed purpose of intersect, which also has locations in tokyo and dubai, is to act as a “unique, permanent space in select global cities where people can experience the ethos of the lexus lifestyle without getting behind the steering wheel of one of our cars.” it’s not a mantra that screams “restaurant” or “hospitality.” perhaps this is why everything feels a little different here. bathrooms lie behind two sets of space-age sliding doors; toilets come equipped with heated seats. cool. anyone who uses those restrooms must pass by that suv — not to mention a video installation showing sleepy b-roll of that car. it’s... less cool. and since lexus supports “local and international artisans as they develop their trade,” a retail area sells $350 sunglasses and a reinterpretation of a soccer ball for $410. the main dining room is a window-free affair, accented with off-white bookshelves, light-brown woods, and a generic open kitchen. the space is as removed from the city as an upscale airline concessioner in denver, las vegas, or cincinnati.lexus should find a way to move at least part of the dining room to street level, imparting a sense of vibrancy to a stretch of manhattan that’s often bereft of pedestrians after 8 p.m. instead, all that passers-by see is that cafe space, which can appear as barren as the retail shops nearby. a restaurant should foster a sense of community. the community defined by intersect feels like a sterile world dreamed up by a wealthy baby boomer from the suburbs. it feels built for aging lexus owners, with the sound system piping out billy joel, petula clark, and jackson browne.and that brings up the menu format. marchand is one of the leading members of the french bistronomie movement, which generally favors small plates (or tasting menus) in casual, affordable-ish settings. it’s a movement that helped bring a more personal and accessible approach to ambitious dining to paris, and it paved the way for auteur-esque new york venues like estela or contra.intersect, by contrast, takes the brilliant cooking of marchand but confines it to a clunky three-course menu. it’s as if the pulsating urgency of parisian gastronomy is being retrofitted for a stereotypically fancy restaurant in manhasset, long island.so can a sponsored restaurant work? yes, but the model needs tweaking. intersect claims it wants to be an “immersive cultural experience,” and to “to engage, inspire and stimulate young creators whose ideas will shape our tomorrow,” and that’s great! but for now, the only “programming” listed for cultural experience is the valentine’s day prix fixe, as well as an offer to “meet the vehicle combining high performance with unrestrained luxury.” it’s referring, of course, to the car in the lobby.cost: starters at $18-$22; mains at $27-$46; desserts at $13. bar snacks and plates run $8-$24. all prices are service-included; there is no tipping.sample dishes:  fluke carpaccio with crispy quinoa and beets; foie gras with pastrami; gnocchi with sweetbreads and mushrooms; cauliflower with nuts, seeds, dates, and curry; duck with sesame, sunchoke, salsify, and tatsoi; yuzu mont blanc, tarte tatin with cardamom cream.bonus tip:  the cafe space, during the day, is a much more pleasant space than starbucks reserve roastery to type away on a laptop with a cup of coffee and a pastry. the cafe, unfortunately, is card-only, like the restaurant.critic’s note: this review is presented without stars due to the regular chef changesspa 88 heals the body from outside and within, delivering some of the city’s most satisfying borscht and pelmenimy first piece of advice about the russian banya, or bathhouse, is that the cold dip pool is for cooling off. it is not for swimming. that’s a lesson i learned as a 16-year-old doing laps at a tiny pool in st. petersburg. the water was 38 degrees. i was pretty stupid.my second piece of advice about the banya, a slavic sweat-bathing tradition for over 1,000 years, is that you will eat well there. this is particularly true at spa 88 in fidi, a two decade-old sanitarium where people in bathing suits feast on some of the city’s finest former soviet  union fare. i’ve been schvitzing here for the better part of a decade, a love affair that began because another one ended. briefly: she moved out of my place and into his. and the banya is where i went to recover. it was a place to numb my pain without alcohol, to take an impromptu nap without explanation (try that in a bar), and to have an emotional meltdown without interrupting dinner. the banya is where i went to heal.a patron leaving the schvitz; georgian-style chicken tabaka; another patron preparing for a platza treatment; tea with borschtnotions of convalescence notwithstanding, the russian spa does not traffic in spa food or contemporary wellness fare; there’s no avocado toast or acai bowls. it serves the same salt-of-the-earth preparations that russians, uzbeks, georgians, and ukrainians are famous for anywhere. think: tender lamb shashlik (kebabs), hearty goluptsi (meat-stuffed cabbage), and soft vareniki (steamed dumplings) stuffed with sweet cherries.eating under these conditions isn’t quite like visiting a steakhouse or brasserie. the heat, followed by icy plunges, exhausts the body in a profound way. it induces hunger. feeling the life come back to your almost-numb (or profusely sweating) extremities as you slurp up ukha — clear fish soup with a potent taste of the sea — is a very different sensation than feeling your stomach distend after ingesting yet another slice of ribeye.this is where the banya differs from its american analogues, those piney, wood-paneled rooms at equinox where suburbanites unwind after watching dr. oz for an hour on the elliptical. a fitness-club sauna is blandly calming. a russian sauna is stressful. and while the ultimate result is that you will, at some point during your multi-hour session, become wonderfully relaxed, the process of getting there is a rigorous mental and metabolic affair.spa 88’s narrow entrance, located next to a pawn shop on fulton, belies the expansiveness of this subterranean behemoth. it packs a lap pool, a cigar room, a jacuzzi that’s hogged by non-russian speakers, a juice bar that hawks dried fish, massage rooms, cold rooms, a restaurant, a cafe, and four hot rooms, each of which tax the body with very specific degrees of heat and pain. the infrared sauna (lolz: “bulletproof your immune system”) is the most useless of the three. better to start off with the turkish bath, foggy with crisp eucalyptus steam, before moving on to the old american schvitz, where people dump buckets of water over themselves to prolong the pain. then graduate to the dry russian sauna. here, the temperature is so hot (180 f or higher), it can start to melt a plastic container, releasing its toxins. if you bring in a water bottle, you will be admonished.some patrons slather their faces in honey, which russians historically believe is a natural detoxifier and skin softener. others might hire a man with military-grade forearms to whip them with wet oak branches, resulting in the leaves releasing “organic phytoncides, infection inhibitors, decreasing the growth and development of pathogens in the body,” per the banya. this treatment, known as platza, perfumes the surrounding benches with the scent of a damp forest.on a saturday afternoon, you sit closer to people than you would at a communal table. except here, people don’t have shirts on. here, you sweat. your perspiration starts off as a damp treadmill dew, salutary evaporation to keep your exterior cool. but as the minutes pass, your sweat becomes more viscous, mixing with the skin-softening secretions of your sebaceous glands. it’s as if a light film of olive oil is slicking your entire body.then you jump into the cold plunge. you scream. you warm up in the sauna again. you repeat this process so many times that your nerve endings start to tingle and go numb; it is the epidermal analogue to sichuan-style mala. and then you eat. the sweet musk of kharcho — a spicy georgian lamb soup — is detectable from across the table. the broth is the color of gravy. rice adds starchiness; whole peppercorns add fire. it is hearty without being rich, seasoned without being salty. it lets patrons return to the hot room without burdening the digestive system or blurring the senses. so you go back in and sweat.from top left: the cafe at spa 88; showering after the hot room; heading back into the sauna.the banya serves as a respite from the traditional restaurant dining experience, an enjoyable if restrictive construct where patrons are shunted to a bar until the party is complete, directed to a table for dining, presented a check upon request, and then expected to leave with haste. at the spa, your companions do not need to arrive at the same time as you do, a convenience that holds true at literally any bathhouse, from the century-old east village one, to the sprawling banya in seagate, to the korean spa castle in queens. patrons aren’t pinned to their chairs, either; you can wander around without eight staffers asking whether you need help. and you can stay so long that it’s not unreasonable to have two separate meals during one visit.the banya is the antithesis to the safe two-drink date. it is showing up at balthazar for lunch and leaving after dinner.much of the same could be said of food halls and venues like starbucks reserve roastery, which function as stay-as-long-as-you-want coworking spaces while hawking expensive pour-over coffee and artisanal pastries. but still, the banya is different from those all-day venues in that the gastronomy is even further removed from the equation. this is why dining at the bathhouse recalls dining at baseball games, football games, bowling alleys, municipal pools, arcades, mess halls on ski slopes, or this really weird alligator zoo in florida where they fed me fried gator. the banya reminds me of how i used to eat before i ate for a living, which is to say at places where food was a vital part of a larger activity, not the single religious event around which an entire evening was organized.the banya is a place for a more heterogeneous group of body types than a boutique spin class. it’s a place where, if the finance bros get too loud, you simply throw water on the hot rocks and watch them flee to the upstairs whirlpool bath. the goal of the spa isn’t culinary enlightenment or showing off one’s abs in expensive athleisure. you come to the banya for cleansing, restoring, meditating, and socializing in cheap used swim trunks, which are provided free of charge.my last piece of advice about the banya is to consider the central events in the irony of fate, a soviet screwball comedy from 1975. on new year’s eve, a group of friends get so drunk at a moscow bathhouse that they send the wrong guy on a flight back to leningrad. the poor chap doesn’t realize his predicament until he wakes up 450 miles away from home, in the bed of a woman no less. a love story ensues and there’s biting commentary on drab soviet architecture — dude couldn’t tell which city he was in — but really, the point here is that if you drink at the banya, be careful!so while the infused vodkas might be tempting, i’d say a single beer is about the upward limit of alcohol consumption. if the goal of the spa is to beneficially dehydrate, the goal of the cafeteria is to put fluids back in.this applies to solid nourishment as well. keep things simple, and always order borscht, a soup that’s cloudy and dense with cabbage but with enough tartness to counter the restrained sugars of the beetroot. also consider the khash, armenian beef foot and tripe soup, with a float of scallions and pepperoncini. your lips will stick together from the gelatins.the name of the formal upstairs restaurant, which also services the lower-level banya cafeteria, is matryoshka, the term for the famous russian dolls within a doll that decorate the room. for better results, dine in the cafeteria. you seat yourself on a plastic nautical high-back chair — like the ones they rent on european beaches — and you eat food off a backyard-style glass table.you place an order at the counter, take a few runs into the hot rooms — no need to wait at your table like at a traditional restaurant — and in about 10 to 15 minutes, your meal is ready. perhaps you’ll ask for sweet blini with salty salmon roe; the maritime musk of the red caviar awakens the senses. feeling just a touch more peckish? then order pelmeni, siberian pork dumplings doused in sour cream, or georgian chicken tabaka, poussin that’s been crisped under a brick till crisp and juicy and slathered with garlic.then you take a nap, possibly on a soft couch, but more likely at your table. ten minutes later, you wake up. you take a swing of poland spring water. you realize that maybe this water isn’t yours. you drink some more anyway, and you stride back into the sauna, a little more relaxed, and a little more fortified to face the never-ending cold dip pool that is a new york winter.cost: $50 full-day admission for the bathhouse, though there’s no fee for guests only visiting matryoshka restaurant.\\xa0platza is an extra $40. service is not included.sample dishes: blini with red caviar, kharcho soup, borscht, siberian pelmeni, georgian-style chicken tabaka, lamb shashlik, garlic fried potatoes.bonus tip: leave about three hours or more for a proper visit, or longer if you plan on napping. but pace yourself. go easy on the hot russian sauna and cold dip pool, especially if you’re a first timer. consider wearing a wool hat ($20 at the gift shop) to protect your head from the heat. also, don’t be a creep!\\xa0critic’s note: this column is presented without stars because food is only one part of the larger bathhouse experience.the famous chicago import is indulgent to a fault, and not nearly worth the wait that it commands at its tribeca locationto observe the flattop at au cheval, the new york spinoff of brendan sodikoff’s chicago burger palace, is to witness black steel turn pink. the cooks here do not tend to verdant asparagus or springtime ramps; rather, they traffic in flesh, blood, and marrow. beef patties and pork belly cover the griddle with such density that an intrepid cat could walk across without burning its paws. it is a carpet of meat. an angus rug that sizzles. these burgers are why otherwise rational humans subject themselves to an inordinately long wait before dinner. the tribeca hotspot offers two optional toppings: a fried egg and a layer of pepper bacon — the kind that’s cut so thick it could stand alone as an appetizer. those add-ons are for those who want, to borrow the words of a waiter, “the instagram burger.” i want no such thing. twenty minutes later, my server sends over the standard model: two seared patties. they boast a handsome maillard char and a midlevel bovine punch. american cheese — or as i like to call it, yellow salt — folds itself into the brown nooks and crannies. this all goes into a golden brioche bun slicked with dijonnaise. it is a tasty burger. then again, there is no shortage of tasty burgers in new york. that’s worth keeping in mind when a host says it’s going to be 90 minutes before you sit down.also worth keeping in mind: the signature item runs $27 with fries, placing it firmly within gourmet burger territory. add the suggested toppings and you’re at $35, which places it alongside the db burger as one of the city’s priciest. but while boulud’s truffle- and foie gras-stuffed specimen is a veritable act of expert charcuterie, the au cheval burger, with all the fixins, is a gloppy, runny, everything-falls-out-when-you-bite-it expression of american junk food. it’s not quite in the same league as its peers.back in 2010, when the iphone was still in its infancy, apple sent developers a rather famous set of guidelines. “if your app doesn’t do something useful or provide some form of lasting entertainment, it may not be accepted,” the tech giant wrote, adding, “we don’t need any more fart apps.”the city’s restaurant scene would benefit from a similar set of guidelines. to wit: our new york doesn’t really need any more classic steakhouses or expensive burgers. there’s something positively head-spinning about a well-funded operator looking out over the cityscape and declaring, gosh, new york could really use a few more ribeyes and pat lafrieda blend patties. and yet here’s thomas keller, bestowing manhattan with a carbon copy of his miami chophouse at hudson yards, and there’s sodikoff, giving tribeca a near replica of his windy city spot.the indulgent menu is nearly identical to the original; the only real difference is the digs. the room is smaller in chicago, and the service is efficient. here in new york, the ceilings are high enough and the booths are roomy enough to suggest a grand brasserie or prix fixe spot. sodikoff, who made his new york debut with the ultra-exclusive 4 charles prime rib (good luck getting a reservation before 11:45 p.m.), bills this as a diner. if that truly were the case, it would heed the cue of meme’s or gertie’s, two venues that seek to rethink that dying form with a mix of nostalgia, generosity, and egg creams.sodikoff’s use of the term feels more ironic than honest. is “diner” really the right description for a venue that books up between 5 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.? where a host says “we’ll text you,” rather than invite you to hang out in the downstairs bar? where the lighting is as dim as at a nightclub? where food isn’t delivered as platters with sides, but rather ordered a la carte, as at a steakhouse? in a city where affordability and accessibility feel under assault at every angle, “diner” isn’t a term worth ceding ground on.au cheval’s food — unlike the bright, high-acid fare of the past few years — functions as a throwback to the fatty aughts or a hat tip to chicago’s historic affinity for meat. the single burger comes with two patties and the double comes with three. fried bologna is piled as high as a mini kakigori. vegetarians don’t have much to work with here, save a not quite palate-cleansing green salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, or an omelet stuffed with too much chevre. herbivores can also pretend the fries aren’t crisped in beef fat. one might justify this as bucking trends, or as “transgressive cooking,” as my colleague robert sietsema put it. i’d counter that the prevailing philosophy at au cheval is to ignore accepted principles of good cooking, or of what normal stomachs and bodies can handle. that said, here’s what to order and what to avoid. chilaquiles: traditionally, the dish consists of tortilla chips simmered in salsa. that much is true here, except au cheval stacks everything high and adds sour cream, guacamole, egg, and jalapenos. the chips and toppings are arguably more in conversation with american nachos than the mexican staple, but it doesn’t suffer from the fusion-y sensibilities. the salsa is applied generously enough to offset all the richness.general jane’s fried chicken: a whole bird lacquered up in a honey-soy-ginger glaze. the exterior color recalls the dark, molasses-like hue of pok pok’s fish sauce wings, albeit with a touch less balance or complexity. each bite yields a hefty crunch and tender flesh, with some of the fattier bits giving off a deep, poultry kick. sprigs of cilantro keep the rampant sweetness in check, if only barely.eggs with foie gras: a moat of tawny shallot-sherry gravy spills across mounds of soft yellow curds. this isn’t a study in contrasts, but rather an essay in amplification; the eggs enrich the sauce, while the sauce adds salty, umami oomph to the eggs. the only thing that’s out of place are the knobs of foie gras, which are overcooked and only serve to pump up your bill. the cost is $28.root beer float: this concoction is more of a parfait, with interspersed layers of ice cream and soda. the result is a sundae that’s easier to eat than most floats; diners aren’t tasked with attacking a single globule of frozen dairy bobbing up and down as it melts. the root beer, incidentally, packs an assertive sarsaparilla sucker punch.mille-feuille: pastry cream as thick as cheesecake sits between layers of puff pastry the color of milk chocolate. it is an excellent american tweak to the french classic. the chicken barlocated down a flight of stairs, just before the restrooms, the chicken bar is where to pass an hour or so while you wait for a friday-night table. the red-hued lighting\\xa0is bewildering and blinding at first, but your eyes will adjust (though your phone’s camera will not). here’s how to roll like a pro down here:drink a painkiller. bartenders pour the frozen tiki cocktail into tiny plastic water cups. the soothing, silky mixture of rum, pineapple, orange, and coconut efficiently cleanses the palate of the aggressively seasoned fried chicken. ($14)try a hot chicken sando. the downstairs kitchen fries up three chicken fingers, seasons them with cayenne, ancho, and gochujang, and places them each inside a comically tiny bun. the poultry packs an intense salinity and an impressive crunch, and while the heat level is mild, a dose of crystal hot sauce, available at the bar, should get the job done. ($10)avoid the bacon cheese fries. there’s not much going on here, just a pile of bland fries with underseasoned and underspiced bacon chili and cheese sauce. ($10)fries: the fries at au cheval have received the type of breathless praise that one would expect to see hanging above a broadway marquee. let me be brief here: they are fine. sometimes they are crispy; sometimes they are not. the beef tallow adds no distinctive flavor or aroma.the burger: a perfectly respectable burger, though a touch pricey at $27 with fries (or $18 without). the bacon-and-egg burger provides impressive flavors as well, but it’s a drippy, unstructured mess.hash browns with duck hearts: this isn’t a typical shaved potato hash; au cheval instead uses diced and roasted potatoes. the crispiness factor is more subdued. in any case, cooks slather the nuggets in mornay and duck gravy. this would be a reasonably nourishing dish at a roadside diner in, let’s say, montana, after a long day of skiing and hunting elk. but one might argue such organ-y and carb-y indulgences don’t quite jibe with a hot and humid new york summer.broiled salmon: this is the sole fish option here. the kitchen, rather than letting the fish express its luxuriant oils, sends out a well-done slab of salmon. the menu promises brown butter and black pepper, neither of which are apparent on the product that arrives. the flesh has the texture of well-done tuna fish and comes with a side of what the waiter eagerly describes as “steak salt.” it tastes like any salt.chevre omelet: a classic demilune of scrambled eggs, folded over goat cheese and red bell peppers. this isn’t a bad pairing, per se, but the eggs are infused with such an obscene amount of butter and salt that the palate craves acidity, be it a zingier cheese or tart oven-roasted tomatoes. instead, the chevre adds fat and the pepper adds sugar. it is a study in too much.bologna sandwich: the key to a good fried bologna sandwich is imparting the mortadella with a mid-level char, causing the edges to curl up like roni cups; the crispy bits act as a counterpoint to the meat’s intrinsic sweetness. here at au cheval, however, the sandwich is simply a pile of warm, nutmeg-laced cold cuts on a bun. a slathering of melted cheese and dijonnaise increase the glop factor. a corner deli could do better.cost: excluding the $50 pork porterhouse for two, all dishes are under $30, with many items falling below $20. a standard burger meal, however, can quickly get pricey. the signature item is $18 by itself, $23 with bacon, $26 with a fried egg, and $35 with all of the above, plus fries ($9). add on two drinks and you’re at nearly $90 for one after tax and tip.sample dishes: green salad with pickled shallot, kale caesar, foie gras with scrambled eggs and toast, fried bologna sandwich, chilaquiles, classic burger, mille-feuille, root beer float.bonus tip: tables are released on resy a week out and get snapped up quickly. walk-ins during the off hours can face no waits; during prime time, waits can creep up past 90 minutes. also: consider swinging by just for coffee, be it a pourover or a “military latte” (a creation that’s dusted with matcha and cocoa powder) at the sawada stand inside.at costas spiliadis’s greek seafood restaurant at hudson yards, the one constant is that you’ll feel cheated — whether the food is grand or averageat the sprawling hudson yards location of milos, the costas spiliadis seafood chain that treats diners as if they were marks at a pickpockets convention, no event is more pivotal to the nightly con than the tour. a server approaches your table and invites you to browse a selection of seafood. the options look immaculate. small mountains of ice hold a seafaring selection not often seen in new york: emperor fish, with anime eyes and a millenial-pink sheen. carabinero shrimp, as unnaturally red as a coca-cola can. rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest jurassic park film. this is where you choose your dinner — a process that occurs, almost universally, after you’ve plowed through half a pomegranate daiquiri. it’s the maritime equivalent of shopping for engagement rings with a glass of bubbly. you almost don’t notice when a waiter recommends you kick off the meal with langoustines that runs $102 per pound. besides, there’s no way he’ll give you anything close to a pound. right?make no mistake: you have been primed for a shakedown, cartier-style. one of the holy grails of modern fine dining has been finding a way to de-emphasize the transactional experience of a meal. the culinary arts have always been uniquely handicapped in this sense. opera would have a different feel if a soprano kicked off the evening by telling spectators “this aria is going to cost you a ton,” and then sent out a check to everyone at the end of the night.some of america’s most expensive restaurants have solved this problem via a ticketing system, having guests pay for meals in advance. milos takes a different tack, obscuring as many prices as possible throughout the course of an evening. the saga starts back at that tour. the captains sing nuanced praises for the barbounia, fagi, and lavraki. they know which ones are oily, which ones are buttery, and that there’s “not much cheek meat in the turbot.” they know every detail — except for the prices, a subject they avoid so diligently that one wonders whether these veritable ichthyologists skipped a very specific day of school.by-the-pound prices are posted above most fish. that price, though, means you’re looking not at the actual cost but the raw data for an incomplete math equation. either way, you’re paying more attention to the waiter’s musings on the milos yacht (which you can apparently rent in the aegean sea), or how a two-and-a-half-pound lobster would be nice for a solo diner. the lobsters bear no price tags, which is dangerous for a main that costs more than round-trip airfare to chicago.you return to your linen-clad table and ask for two langoustines and a turbot. the server says the whole fish is three pounds. you know the price is $56 per pound — you were smart enough to take notes — so you figure you’ll be out $160. and yet, when the bill comes, the price is $197. that can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil. then you take a closer look at the check and notice the fish is half a pound heavier than the waiter told you it would be. whoops!those langoustines, in turn, boast a sweet, gas-grilled aroma, though they lack the intense, oceanic aroma these crustaceans have elsewhere. you didn’t inquire about the price, because you got tired of asking “how much do these actually cost?” you figured a few prawns would cost less than caviar service. you figured wrong. they’re a cool $87 for an appetizer’s worth of meat. this is when you start to spew expletives. the well-heeled might find this system unobtrusive, and perhaps there’s something honest about assigning a very specific price to an individual fish based on its weight. there’s also a certain elegance in convincing guests to part with a few extra dollars and make them feel like it was worth it. but everyday gourmands might find something disingenuous about implementing that system in such a way that dinner ends up costing you $100 more than you budgeted for. constant incongruities on a bill at milos feel more like the work of an unscrupulous bookie than an honest act of hospitality. the food, too, does not always deliver on unexpectedly ballooned costs. the carabinero prawns — a receptionist told me i’d pay $30 apiece; the bill charged $40 — tasted like shellfish to the power of 10, but a lobster pasta in which diced tail meat gets tossed into a sherry cream sauce did little better than neighborhood restaurants that charge almost four times less. with two medium-sized claws, the middling dish arrived on the bill at $189. instead, order the soft-shell crab. at $27 apiece, they’re a heck of a price, but the cooks do them right, pan-frying them in a way that seems to preserve their briny juices better than elsewhere. the best way to hit milos, though, is to sit at the bar, order a pound of the rarely-seen-in-nyc fried red mullets, and tear away at the small fish with a buddy. the impossibly sweet flesh, when it’s not overcooked, recalls the fragrant, mineral aromas of the mediterranean.that’s the thing about milos. you can have a reasonably grand meal here. you can have a reasonably average meal here. and yet the one constant is that on every visit, you feel cheated.walnut cake with ice cream, goat’s milk yogurt with thyme honey, greek ceviche, and other dishes from estiatorio milosspiliadis has been at this for a while now. he opened his first milos in montreal in 1979, followed that up with a midtown manhattan location in 1997, and replicated those efforts in london, vegas, and seattle. if nothing else, his new york stalwart deserves credit for occupying a very specific role in the fine dining community; the city’s most expensive restaurants have long focused on manipulating, refining, and saucing food, while milos has always been the ultimate pure product emporium, minimally adorning fish and serving them grilled, pan-fried, or salt-baked. if done right, like it is at bartolotta in las vegas, this style of dining can be quite wonderful. at hudson yards, it feels more like an ode to long island dining. that is to say: you can pay a lot of money for a lot of forgettable food while hanging with a bunch of middle-aged guys in leather jackets jockeying for the bartender’s attention.this isn’t exactly danny meyer generosity or ambience, either. hosts don’t say goodbye. the guy who pours you a drink won’t transfer your tab. and the ambience evokes a cheap cruise with obstructed views; the lighting is so poor that the panoramic windows do a better job at reflecting back the dining room than providing a view of the hudson.i suppose i could have devoted an equally long essay to service issues — to the fact that one can eat the bulk of that lobster without a wine or cocktail, because you couldn’t flag down a waiter. to the fact that you can go 60 minutes after arriving without food because the restaurant is overbooked and the waiters ignore you after you’re seated. to the fact that you might get a table overlooking the mall. thing is, we’re all familiar with these stories; stereotypically bad restaurants are a dime a dozen in this city. i highlight the opaque pricing because an unsuspecting diner could really get taken here. and that is what makes milos a uniquely bad restaurant. cost: anywhere from $150-$250 per person for a full 3-4 course meal. for a more affordable experience, consider the $32 business lunch, or the $57 family weekend lunch. remember that most fish and shellfish are listed as mp.sample dishes: carabinero prawns, fried red mullet, langoustines, charred octopus, stone crab claws (seasonal), maryland crab cake, greek ceviche with feta, assorted grilled fish, galaktoboureko\\xa0(lemon custard in phyllo), baklava.bonus tip: waiters sometimes offer to weigh a fish, but will rarely tell you the resulting price. to stay under budget, ask what the total “weighed” portion of your order will cost.cédric vongerichten’s first restaurant without his famous father is an indonesian stunner in nolitaat the chef’s counter at wayan, cédric and ochi vongerichten’s stunner of an indonesian restaurant, a waiter pours a glass of champagne as cooks tend to sizzling satays. skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. but from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. the chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. this is unexpected. indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to dutch to middle eastern to indian to polynesian to chinese. but broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. it’s a style of cooking new york restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at nargis. and yet at wayan in nolita, due to fire code issues, the team executes this southeast asian staple via a european-style griddle. the skewers do not suffer from the adaptation. if chicken satays sound boring, consider this: the thigh meat exhibits the silkiness of tofu, while a beige peanut sauce flaunts the richness of cream. it’s like blanquette de veau on a stick, albeit energized with coconut and red curry. pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. and sticks of florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ochi, a jakarta native involved in everything from menu development to tableware, and her chef-husband cédric, have given new york a thrilling addition to its contemporary southeast asian scene. like uncle boons, kopitiam, jeepney, and elsewhere, wayan shows off compelling strains of modernity rooted in tradition.alongside a cilantro-scented filet of steamed bass, the delicate flesh just firmer than custard, a waiter places a single bakwan jagung, a classic corn fritter plated for the social media era. cédric garnishes the creation with scallions and sits it on a tiny pedestal; the flavor is pure fried chicken skin while the visuals are very el bulli.a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, this is the type of restaurant one might have expected from cédric’s father, jean-georges vongerichten, the franco-american chef who shook up new york gastronomy in the late ’90s and early aughts. from his eponymous central park flagship to his clubby spice market in the meatpacking district, he drew upon his days cooking in thailand, singapore, and hong kong to fuse asian sensibilities with continental fare. he flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier midtown venues. the flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.that style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at wayan. cédric, a bangkok-born chef who also runs perry st, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. you roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.particularly breathtaking is sop buntut, javanese oxtail soup. the broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. on the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. fancy french chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. and that’s precisely what cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm maillard char.really, if there were any fears about whether wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the new york restaurant world. the prevailing jean-georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland east-meets-west menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. such fears are not entirely unwarranted. vong kitchen in jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” cédric and jean-georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the wayan menu. there’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any nobu or robuchon in moscow or tokyo. there’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. and then there’s wayan’s crabcake, garnished with a vertical build of cucumbers and sprouts as if it were one of alfred portale’s “tall” dishes from the 1980s. with so many brilliant southeast asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the american country club variety. make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. but still, it’s disappointing that cédric, instead of trying to introduce new yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. the name wayan, incidentally, is balinese; it means first-born. the tao-ish design (rockwell group) is a hat tip to that island as well, with reclaimed wood and hanging vines evoking its vernacular architecture. the decorative spices strewn throughout the restaurant, from cinnamon to star anise, by contrast, feel like an ode to pottery barn.more inspirational is the nasi goreng, a must-order. indonesian meals are often built around rice, and wayan’s version of the staple is deeply flavorful with the aroma of garlic. pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk. or for an equally complex starch, the kitchen slicks chinese-style lamian noodles with kecap manis, a molasses-like soy sauce, as well with a throat-tickling blend of chiles and black peppercorns. for good measure, they also throw in a few chunks of lobster so powerfully flavored one wonders if cédric found a way to dry-age the crustacean.the dessert of choice is pandan custard, as much a visual triumph as a gustatory one. cédric pours a layer of passionfruit juice, along with its seeds, along the top layer of the confection. you dip in your spoon as if you were digging into a halved tropical fruit, but what comes out is not yellow flesh but rather oozy, vanilla-laced pudding. the juice acts as an assertive, acidic counterpoint to the indulgent dairy. jean-georges also does a bit of trompe l’oeil over on central park west, where caviar sits atop what appears to be a lemon — it’s really just citron gelee. like father, like son, i suppose, but i’ll cast my vote for the cheaper $12 faux fruit! cost: satays at $12-$15; small plates at $12-$19; mains at $24-$29, with one exception: steak is $59. expect to spend about $100 per person for a fully-loaded meal with two drinks each after tax and tip.sample dishes: chicken, pork, and shrimp satays, hearts of palm with mango and passionfruit, javanese oxtail soup, indonesian corn fritter, nasi goreng, yellow chicken with coconut milk, steamed black bass with cilantro, baby back pork ribs with tamarind glaze (not too sweet; very well balanced!), pandan custard.desi tacos and cumin-laced guacamole are executed well at the clubby restaurant, but service issues hold back the former indian accent chefhere’s the scene on a recent night at gupshup, a hip new indian restaurant that has attracted the likes of actor anupam kher and comedian jimmy fallon. bollywood movies show at the upstairs bar while thumping club music — not so much the dancing kind as the anonymous variety familiar from a duty-free cosmetics store — fills the dining room. a large group of elite yelpers, distinguished by their very cool nametags, are mingling, swirling red wine, and hovering too close to our table. my party has been waiting for the first course to show up, but when a server finally swings by, she brings something a bit less expected: a beverage bill from the downstairs bar. “it would be great if you could settle up,” she says. how welcoming.ten minutes later, a waiter ferries over a tray filled with guacamole, tacos, ramen, and other fusiony fare that wouldn’t feel out of place at a clubstaurant like tao or vandal. that reality extends to the cocktail list. anyone who orders the house mule, a watery mix of grey goose, turmeric, ginger, and lavender, will have to ask for an “ayurvedic jackass.” it’s all enough to make one wonder: is it not odd that chef gurpreet singh, whose eye for nuance made indian accent one of the city’s more exhilarating fine dining experiences, is channeling the ubiquities (and ignominies) of the modern food world? it is odd — until you start eating.guacamole, at first glance, is indistinguishable from other excellent versions elsewhere. cooks mash the avocados to order with green chiles and cilantro — nothing out of the ordinary. but a few subtle tweaks make the dish stand out. cooks lace the fruit with cumin; its sweet musk wafts along the palate. and instead of fried tortillas, gupshup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from gujarat. and while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. it’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.for “tacos,” singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. the soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. it conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. you continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of gramercy.the dining room and the jackfruit tacosthere are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of indian fare in new york. one of them, which includes venues like chintan pandya’s adda and hemant mathur’s sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). these venues function to remind new yorkers that south asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of south asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. one thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of rahi in greenwich village or the foie gras duck haleem of baar baar, a frenetic bowery space with a buddakan-style vibe.gupshup, by indian-born restaurateur jimmy rizvi (korali estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. it finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist karishma naran’s mural of a modern indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.that means saturday morning avocado toast. the line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether singh adds anything to the conversation. the chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. it would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. gupshup’s ramen is another misstep. that’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. it’s the execution that’s flawed. the ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.those mistakes aside, singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. there’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. but just as momofuku bang bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, gupshup’s own evocation, blending indian sensibilities with jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. the puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. the tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of alka seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in delhi. vendors typically finish it off with butter. singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. but somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. if the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. singh, in short, is taking advantage of new york’s thriving globalism to riff on his ancestral cuisine. and if any of this seems a touch off, kindly remember that gupshup is simply deploying the same whimsical eclecticism as its non-indian peers, from the american restaurant serving southeast asian shrimp toast to the spanish-leaning seafood spot selling sichuan-style pig ear to virtually any sports bar anywhere in the city hawking tacos.singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. the kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. here at gupshup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. it uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of new york restaurants. maybe that will change after more folks try gupshup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. nizams haleem, a staple of ramadan iftar dinners in hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. the humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. it came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. maybe gupshup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? weird things tend to happen here. the host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. when someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” the complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.pre-made desserts, however, are still available if the pastry chef is absent, though it’s not clear whether that’s a good thing. fig and banana sticky pudding is a study in bland flavors and cold, mealy textures. cinnamon panna cotta, on two occasions, tastes like what would happen if a kitchen worker thought that the traditional italian dessert was supposed to flaunt the texture and sweetness of grocery-store cake frosting. for a gramercy park restaurant with operators as experienced as this, one could reasonably expect more polish; the service missteps tend to distract from the food. and that’s too bad, because singh’s cuisine represents a thrilling chapter in modern new york indian cuisine.cost: starters at $10 to $24; larger dishes at $24 to $46; desserts at $10. ramen appetizer is $16, or $34 with a lobster tail. naan is $5-$7; cocktails are $16; chai is $15.sample dishes: guacamole with khakra crisps, tomato rasam ramen, smoked salmon puchkas, pulled jackfruit “desi tacos,” chicken tikka, kerala beef fry, tiger prawns.bonus tip: if you don’t ask a server to course things out, literally all of your food will show up at once; this is even true for solo diners ordering multiple plates.electric lemon’s airy menu dubiously self-identifies as “clean cuisine,” but the stephen starr restaurant at hudson yards manages to impress anywayelectric lemon is a very good restaurant designed to attract a clientele of fitfluencers, or at least those who dream to be. it claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, pop rocks. the venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. this is, to be fair, all what one might expect at hudson yards’s equinox hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.a lobby host asks if you’re checking in. maybe you are — if you’ve got $2,000 to spend on two nights. most folks will instead take an elevator to the 24th floor. there, among the normals, scores of people who look like cutouts from men’s health are brunching. arms bulge through artisanal sweatshirts. lean torsos jut up like slender tree trunks through drawstring hoodies. a guy in a patagonia-style vest wears airpods throughout his entire meal, even while complaining about his eggs. the kitchen stuffs squishy breakfast sandwiches with heady chicken sausage and pairs them with side salads instead of home fries. christ. a pre-shift manual for waiters, left near a window, offers a primer on carrot juice (“cancer preventer”) and beets (“creates a sense of well-being”), as well as a list of vips staying at the hotel. among them: dolph lundgren and some tech vp.things seem dire until the apple cider doughnuts arrive. they’re rare yeast versions of the autumnal treat, normally made in the cake variety at farmers markets. they shimmer from a light glaze, smelling of cinnamon and wet earth. their texture is bouncy and their flavor is only faintly sweet. herein lies the surprise of electric lemon. those who look past the goop-y branding and weekend djs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. at least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise mid-atlantic fare. and the venue, by mega-restaurateur stephen starr — who runs some of the city’s finest french restaurants, and buddakan — has one hell of a view.the dining room at electric lemon overlooks hudson yards.it is difficult to consider hudson yards without understanding its larger missteps, particularly the fact that the entire compound functions as a taxpayer-subsidized bastion for the rich. but one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the vessel. electric lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the bank of america building, the new yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the hudson river, and the sun setting over the jersey city heights. here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. chef kyle knall (maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. as the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. this is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. a touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. for more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.but for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. but he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. the flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. it all makes for stellar diy tacos.if the the beet-yogurt “beauty bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the new american style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. for example: knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. it’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. it’s curious how, at electric lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in hudson yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots. also: when a restaurant posts a photo of someone holding a cocktail while their cephalic vein bursts out of their forearm, that effectively signals the type of bodies that belong here, and those that don’t.whatever the case, kelly nam’s spectacular desserts more closely adhere to the ethos of french pastry and american junk food than any diet regimen. when a server sets down one of the desserts, he points out that you can “hear” the pop rocks fizzle and hiss. how bucolic. nam laces the candy into orbs of pale green lemon verbena sorbet. next to them, she places frozen spheres of lemon curd. she arranges this all in such a way that channels a faraway solar system, where the orbital bodies are made of sugar and colored in pastels. the sorbet is soft and fragrant; the curd is firm and bracingly sour; and the pop rocks, more audible than visible, vibrate across the tongue like a soft electric current. “moon rock” exhibits no fewer complexities. the chef showers a soft ball of chocolate in dense, black sesame feuilletine and honeycomb crisps, resulting in an amorphous mass that tastes like a cross between a butterfinger and a reese’s peanut butter cup. and since any nut butter calls for dairy, a quenelle of goat’s milk ice cream helps unstick the palate with a kick of barnyard funk. nam’s ideas and executions hint at the type of creative modernism max boonthanakit conjures at nightshade in los angeles, and the technical wizardry that stephanie prida produces at the pool or the lobster club. this is just as true of her frozen yogurt, indented like a thanksgiving gravy boat to hold a pool of verdant juiced herbs. it is a striking sweet-sour contrast in green and white.hudson yards and all its deep flaws aren’t going aways. some folks, justifiably, won’t be able to get past the fact that equinox is owned by related, whose chairman held a high profile fundraiser for president donald trump earlier this year. that aside, electric lemon is a rare place where you can feel that new york magic up high — as long as one ignores the wellness nonsense.cost: starters $12-$24; mains $24-44; desserts $10-$12. expect to spend about $100 or so per person for three courses each plus drinks, tax, and tip.sample dishes: apple cider doughnuts, chia bowl with brazil nuts, razor clams with pickled carrots and cilantro, green tomato carpaccio, roasted lamb with braised breast, grilled bass with fresh herbs and tortillas, lemon curd with lemon verbena sorbet, moon rock with goat’s milk gelato, frozen yogurt with juiced herbs.bonus tip: bar seating typically doesn’t require too much of a wait, if any, if the dining room has no availability. a dj plays near the bar on weekends, but the volume levels are about on par with a normal, crowded restaurant.sign up for our newsletter.noda and sushi noz both execute a pristine, high-end omakase in spite of a clientele that seems insistent on interrupting the zen experienceone of the modern truths of new york gastronomy is that eating expensive sushi means witnessing the wealthy carry out their extravagant existences. at masa, i watched a party of four wolf down $700 worth of wagyu in a minute. “you’ll be able to pay for a year’s worth of flights with the points from this meal,” one of them said to the man stuck with the check. at ichimura, i saw a group of tourists ignore the fragile nigiri the chef was serving them, letting two or more pieces collect on their plates as they tapped away on their phones. and at zo, two guys sitting nearby insisted on taking care of our $650 bill. after they did (thank you!), they encouraged us to defraud our company by expensing the dinner anyway. it’s with these absurdities in mind that one considers noda in flatiron and noz on the upper east side. both rank among the city’s buzziest and most excellent new sushi joints. both tout traditional edomae services, serving aged raw fish over warm rice, one piece at a time, brushed with little more than nikiri (reduced soy) or maybe a quick grate of yuzu zest. like some of their peers, both traffic in deliciously predictable, flown-in-from-japan luxuries, heaping on piles of depleted bluefin as if this were some kind of all-you-can-eat buffet for endangered-species.and at either venue, you’re liable to encounter an increasingly ubiquitous modern character, satirized on billions. i dub him the sushi bro. he does very well for himself. he’ll tell you about every sushi spot he’s ever dined at. and since you’re all stuck at the same counter, he is having dinner with you, whether you like it or not. from top: chef shigeyuki tsunoda standing behind the sushi bar; a bartender pouring a cocktail; and uni and tofu chawanmushi with caviarshortly after he kicked off his omakase at noda last week, a man in a gray suit emitted a subtle “wow” as he ate his silky chawanmushi with uni and caviar. it’s possible i did the same. the white pudding was stunning, enrobing the tongue with its fats and softening the briny blow of the urchin. a few minutes later, as i was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “wow, they nailed that.” he went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television. thing is, we weren’t at the espn zone. we were at a restaurant where two hours of (mostly) spectacular sushi runs $340 after tip. at this tight chef’s counter, lilliputian portions of fish can require closed eyes and mental zen to appreciate their subtleties. as i placed a single bite of o-toro nigiri, a plump slice of fat-oozing tuna belly, into my mouth, my seatmate leaned over and said, “isn’t that great?” and my concentration was broken. this isn’t the first time i’ve seen this type of bro-ish behavior at a sushi bar, nor will it be the last. no other dinner format so reliably packs as many rich type-a folks behind a well-sanded bar and pours them $30 glasses of sake. and no other exorbitant dinner format has grown with the frenzy of sushi since the economic recovery began a decade ago. over the past five years, new york has seen the debut of at least 10 $300-plus omakase spots, easily outpacing the openings of western-leaning tasting-menu venues or rococo chophouses. they rank among the power restaurants of choice in 2019, due in no small part to the fact that they convey luxury more quickly than a gallic tasting, more nimbly than a gut-busting bastion of beef, and often more discreetly than anywhere, thanks to tiny, windowless spaces.that element of mystery abides at noda. its owners include justin hauser, who used to work for related, the firm behind hudson yards, and david hess, whose family founded the namesake multibillion-dollar energy corporation. (the duo also run the fast-casual bondi sushi next door, where lunch costs less a cocktail at noda.)patrons enter by walking into an anonymous office building, past an unmarked door, and into a purple-hued lounge, a posh holding pen that designer ken fulk, using the backwards tropes of orientalism, once described as a “james bond opium den.” a host pulls back a curtain and escorts everyone to the semi-circular bar, flanked by 10 pink velvet stools. the space more closely recalls an avant-garde cocktail parlor than a traditional sushi spot. tsunoda, late of tokyo’s sushi iwa, stands behind the counter, wielding a foot-long knife. he and his team cut knobs of sweet potato into little squares, to pair with earthy lotus root soup. he slices abalone as if it were quartz, letting the jagged edges marinate in a pool of its own juices; the umami-packed one-biter tastes like a brilliant cross between chicken liver and anchovy water. and then comes the nigiri sushi, distinguished by its otherworldly rice. once upon a time, nigiri constituted a quick form of preservation. vinegar, accordingly, is common at any given sushi spot. what sets noda apart is a more aggressive seasoning level; the tart rice zings the tongue like one of those high-acid salads at wildair.that vinegar adds a touch of punch to golden eye snapper or yellowtail, two cuts that turn out a bit mushy. it also helps tame the musk of hokkaido uni, whose tidal aroma lingers for a full minute after consumption. and it adds a dose of balance to exceedingly fatty bluefin. the chef slices this breed thicker than others. it doesn’t so much melt as bounce with a supple springiness. but when the fishy oils start to overwhelm, the acid kicks in to lend a proper dose of pucker. if only the nigiri courses included a wider variety of fish. and if only my enjoyment of the o-toro wasn’t interrupted by bro-man next to me. yeah, that sounds nitpicky, but think of it this way: a diner gets about 23 bites of steak with a rib-eye, but just a single two-inch bite of any particular fish at a sushi spot. it’s as if someone tried to chat with you during the key plot twist of jordan peele’s us at the movies. you don’t get to hit rewind. then again, that moment faded a bit when tsunoda sliced a single bite of tamago. the yellow rectangle dissolved into a pool of custard when consumed, giving off the seafaring scent of gray shrimp. all of a sudden i couldn’t hear anything else around me.if noda has the air of a dinner party, letting cordial cocktail conversations carry over into the sushi bar, the omakase at sushi noz, owned by brothers david and joshua foulquier, channels a more formal ballet. the restaurant’s website likens the restaurant to a kyoto temple, though the chef has also compared his nightly meals, which start at $325, to kabuki theater. it is performance before a rapt audience. it is meant to be transportive; the restaurant imported over 1,000 pieces of wood from japan, including the 200-year-old hinoki wood counter. servers wear full kimonos with slippers.each of the eight patrons remains silent as the chef, a native of hokkaido, greets every diner with a bow. when he starts to prep — lacing his rice with pungent vinegar, grilling eel over coal and bamboo leaves, or dismembering a live king crab while it’s staring at you — the level of diner chatter rarely rises above a whisper.from upper left: chef nozomu abe presenting a king crab, searing bluefin cheek, and brushing a slice of fatty tuna sushi with a soy reductionthe gently poached crab, almost as light as cotton candy, is spectacular, faintly oceanic at the edges and uniformly sweet within. and for those who think crab is too sugary by itself, anchovy dipping sauce with shiso flowers infuses the meat with the brine of 10 waves. abe then walks past the diners with a few slices of bonito under a cloudy glass dome. he decloches the platter (ta-da!), filling the room with the scent of smoked hay. the fish itself sports the fragile density of jell-o, with its skin disintegrating like burnt marshmallow.noz also offers a $175 nigiri-only experience in the separate “ash room.” the mood here is more lively; during a recent visit patrons chatted about flipping homes and drinking grand-cru burgundies — while ribbing me for ordering a beer.chef junichi matsuzaki produces sushi on par with the more expensive hinoki room. last week, the offerings were slightly less tuna-heavy than next door; they included baby sea bream (tender and glimmering), striped jack (sporting a firm snap), pacific oyster (marinated until it has no flavor), and a rice hand roll laced with anchovy yolk sauce (ultra-crisp and obscenely rich).diners can request extra a la carte nigiri here, though four pieces, served over three minutes added $65 to my bill. for those who don’t mind skipping noz’s excellent composed plates, the ash room functions as a fine economy comfort experience.sushi chefs sometimes like to sate the diner immediately with fat, beginning with a slice of tuna. abe instead commenced the nigiri course with humble squid. he doesn’t cross-hatch it like some, or jazz it up with citrus like others. he simply presents it as a slick study in the color white — wearing an invisible cloak of sweet soy. the cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an msg-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess. the rice, while still distinctly tangy, is a touch less vinegared than at noda. it is more “one” with the fish, rather than distinct.as at noda, though, the meal overall was technically masterful but left me craving more textural revelations, more varieties of seafood. dinner quickly devolves into the four bluefin of the apocalypse: marinated akami (nearly dissolves on the tongue), medium fatty chu-toro (luscious and chewy), fatty o-toro (i’ll let you guess what happened), and charcoal-singed cheek (overcooked and bland).sustainability issues notwithstanding, there’s something depressingly uniform about having to make one’s way through the same four slices of tuna — or five, if you count the inevitable toro hand roll — at a fancy omakase spot, sometimes taking up nearly half the nigiri portion of the meal. that’s not to be disrespectful of the craft; part of the bliss of sushi is akin to the joy of watching shakespeare, seeing the same stories tweaked ever so gently by different directors. but to continue the metaphor: shakespeare wrote a lot of plays, and abe and tsunoda — and some of their peers — seem to follow this one particular bluefin script just a little too closely. these practices recall the modern crutch of a western tasting-menu venue, where so many meals finish with that same hunk of wagyu.still, i’ll enjoy my o-toro. or i’ll try. as i’m halfway into my single bite at noz, the guy next to me — it’s always a guy — decided to ask me “why i eat sushi like that,” as if i could, mid-chew, impart him with some sort of cultural wisdom about how i use my hands to place a piece of food into my mouth. i’d tell you what he was referring to, but that would give credence to a sentient blue blazer watching the way i eat and then interrupting me. alas, this is sushi in new york.cost: dinner is $285, or $342 after 20 percent tip. dinners are fully prepaid via the tock reservations service, and they are nonrefundable. optional sake pairings run $205. three a la carte drinks will easily cost $90 or so after tip.sample dishes: chawanmushi with caviar, grilled scallop wrapped in nori, abalone in its own juices, tamago with gray shrimp, and assorted sushi, including kinmedai, sweet shrimp, lean tuna, medium-fatty tuna, and seared tuna.bonus tip: cocktail buffs can visit the bar without committing to the full omakase.cost: $325 in the hinoki room, or $175 in the ash room for a shorter sushi-only menu. all prices are service-included; there is no additional line for tipping.sample dishes: king crab with anchovy sauce and shiso flowers, grilled and smoked bonito, sea perch with rice, and assorted sushi, including squid, wild yellowtail, pike mackerel, all the grades of tuna, and sea eel. dessert might include super-earthy black sesame pudding.bonus tip: reservations can book up a few weeks out on tock, but unlike with noda, patrons can give up their seats a few days ahead of dinner with no financial penalty; this allows for frequent same-week cancellations and availability. ash room seats are often easier to come by.zhen wei fang and tang hotpot are powered by flashy decor, a robust suite of meats, and complex, flavorful brothsthe most useful thing to know about vandal, a bacchanalian bowery temple to viral foods, faux street art, and a basic cocaine lifestyle, is that it’s adjacent to another let’s-have-a-long-night-out spot that’s actually worth visiting. zhen wei fang, backed by wei chen and the congee village team, pairs its pristine hot pot fare with an absolutely wild environment. a robot host greets guests in mandarin. mixed martial arts matches play on four televisions. michael jackson pumps through the sound system. multitiered meat trays rise 3 feet above every table, flaunting vertical croppings of raw lamb, beef, and tofu skin. diners use chopsticks to plunge red ribbons of new zealand lamb ($15) into white bone broth, turning the flesh brown, soft, and succulent. you slurp the meat almost as easily as you would a noodle. want to combine hot pot with a few hours of sake-fueled karaoke? there are private rooms for that. there are also semi-private rooms that double as immersive multimedia carousels. high-tech projectors broadcast computer-generated nature footage on three separate walls, giving patrons the sensation that they’re dining inside an imax universe inspired by 1990s screensavers. leaves fall over ersatz mountains; palm trees sway in the digital wind. as a waiter sears expensive wagyu over a hot stone, snow falls upward toward outer space. the title song to free willy plays on the speakers, and you let silken a5 wagyu, slathered in pork fat and sichuan chiles, dissolve on your tongue for $80.what a new york story: in the literal shadow of one of the city’s most irrationally packed culinary establishments is a hangout that’s killing it — a little more quietly, and with a lot more heart. and in case anyone’s worried zhen wei’s visual antics might compete with the gustatory bliss, there’s another place called tang down the block hawking high-end hot pot fare in a more sedate environment.the back dining room at zhen wei fang.once upon a time, a hot pot spot in vegas was the country’s most expensive restaurant. the chef was masa takayama (yes, that guy), who served a $500 omakase of shabu shabu, the japanese adaptation of the chinese tradition. it didn’t last, but new york has a solid representation of that elevated style at macoron, where a celebrated hot pot tasting runs $128. chinese hot pots, by contrast, a pan-regional tradition with roots in the han dynasty, haven’t reached those levels of extravagance in the big apple. high-end sinosphere fare isn’t nonexistent — one thinks of the $150-plus fish-maw platters at oriental garden or the black-truffle luxuries of hakkasan — but such venues haven’t yet reached the critical mass of expensive french, japanese, or italian venues.local hot pot cuisine in particular remains an affordable affair, ranking with korean barbecue and american smokehouses as some of the most accessible and vital big apple restaurants for groups. some, like hou yi in the east village, draw in budget diners with $31 all-you-can-eat affairs and self-serve ice cream bars. others, like mister hotpot in sunset park, aim for a late-night crowd, hawking reasonably priced meats until 2 a.m.what sets apart zhen wei, and the sichuan-leaning tang down the block (more on that below), is that they’re modernizing the manhattan hot pot experience a bit more pronouncedly than their excellent peers. it’s all in a similar vein to the efforts of other ambitious operators from the mainland and taiwan, which is to say they’re updating and repackaging their ancestral fare for a booming chinese student population — and anyone else willing to spend a few extra dollars at more fashionably contemporary restaurants.that roughly means patrons at both venues will encounter, to a greater or lesser extent, posh interior designs, performative sourcing, bespoke cocktail lists (ugh), craft beers, orange wines, exorbitant wagyu and abalone, and, at tang, a lighting scheme so instagrammable that the museum of modern art would be jealous. if any of these touches make it feel like a beloved tradition is adopting the moneyed signifiers of obnoxiously hip restaurants, rest assured: both venues manage to keep their souls — counterbalancing stereotypical indulgences with classically chinese organ meats and powerfully fragrant broths.the communal experience is a central element of a hot pot meal; one imagines a hungry crew huddled over a single steaming pot. dinner at zhen wei, however, is more uncommonly individualistic.each patron selects their own $6 broth, which simmers on a personal induction burner. it’s tempting to assert there’s something inherently ridiculous about such a setup; one wouldn’t expect a single order of fondue to come in three separate crocks for sanitary reasons. but i’d retort that the courtesy is entirely less absurd than so many other elements of upscale dining, from the use of four plates underneath a single starter at per se to the use of eight different wine glasses during a tasting-menu beverage pairing. or, more practically: it’s fun to try out different broths at zhen wei by dipping into your neighbors’ pots. it’s the soup version of share plates.most options work well with everything, though the spicy sichuan gives a nice kick to neutral items like soft tofu, gorgeously gummy mung bean noodles (take them out when they turn translucent), slippery tendon (as weightless as shaved bonito), and feathery enoki mushrooms. the intensely porky tang of bone broth, in turn, imparts a savory, swine-y aroma to flaky red snapper and firm sea scallops. and sweet and sour tomato, packed with electric acidity and umami, helps tame the gentle funk of lamb or tripe.every broth boasts a voluptuous roundness that makes them sippable on their own; they’re even better poured into small wooden bowls for ramen-noodle dipping. and although the patrons do much of the cooking here, those stellar soups, intensely funky xo ramekins, and all the prepared items are the fine work of chef wei huang, a guangdong native and pan-regional virtuoso who helmed zhen wei’s first location in miami.the chef grills cumin lamb skewers in the style of a studied xinjiang hangout, offsetting the juicy meat with marshmallow-like fat. he sends out chilled bang bang chicken that balances the poultry’s clean punch with the searing heat of chiles. he whips up shellfish boils on par with le sia, coating barely cooked-through lobster claws with a mess of salted chiles.and he also oversees a kitchen whose cooks ensure everything is sliced thinly enough to cook quickly. this part is simple enough: tongue tastes like tongue; spam tastes like spam. but for what it’s worth, the shaved ribeye is so well marbled it seems to disintegrate with the same elegance as japanese wagyu, and packs no less flavor at just $12. i recommend enjoying all these cuts in the back room, decorated with four 82-inch televisions, each of which shows jackie chan singing on a variety show, on mute.for those who insist on wagyu, yu liu’s tang hotpot, an offshoot of the east village noodle shack, provides it at a marginally lower cost. it’s sold here for $65, or as a smaller portion as part of an $80 combination platter with pleasantly chewy abalone, flaky snapper, heady goat leg, beef short ribs (cut a bit too thickly), paper-thin pork, and shrimp (impressively flavored when simmered in seafood soup).the only catch is that the broths, served communally in copper pops from yunnan, are nominally more expensive than those at zhen wei, though they can serve up to four, making them cheaper for larger parties. spicy sichuan starts at $18 for the table, while a more “curated” version of the same soup — with a separate pot of pork bone broth — runs $23. spoiler: both taste about the same, delivering no more complexity or flavor than than the versions at zhen wei (and arguably a touch less). that brings up the central issue with tang. notwithstanding the fact that new yorkers unquestionably underpay for chinese fare in almost every form, the quality of tang’s food and service don’t necessarily match the higher prices it commands. its beef and lamb selections don’t sing with the clear, powerful flavors one expects. and really, there’s no need for condiments like $4 truffle-oil sesame paste.but what tang can flaunt is a smart beverage program, energetic bar crowds, and shiny digs — evocative of a mid-aughts power spot — by new practice studio, the same firm that did stylish restaurants hao noodle and hunan slurp.a host escorts canada goose jacket-wearing patrons to room booths. louis poulsen radiohus pendant lights, set at uneven heights, do their best impression of summertime fireflies, casting dim luminescence on italian soapstone tables and chartreuse banquettes. a balcony overlooks the dining room — evoking geoffrey zakarian’s erstwhile town — while most tables get a clear view of artist xu han’s piece de resistance, a painting of tang-court women incongruously eating modern hot pot alongside an oktoberfest-sized lager.staffers ferry over sparkling orange wines in thin-lipped glasses, or sake cocktails in coconut shells, often 10 minutes after you order them. and smart-tablet ordering systems mean that food sometimes starts to arrive at your table before a waiter finishes taking your order. aside from hot pot, only a few cold appetizers are on tap for now: run-of-the-mill mung bean noodles with chile sauce or a somewhat limp cold chicken in sesame paste. chef baiguang han, late of szechuan mountain house, doesn’t get to show off his culinary chops as much as his counterpart at zhen wei. one exception is a nice platter of braised and chilled meats, a collection that shows off beef shank, duck wings, pig’s ear, and gizzards in all their chewy, snappy, gelatinous glory. that aside, stick to the raw meats and seafood, the nice wines, and the chinatown ice cream factory scoops of lychee ice cream.successive waves of gentrification have been pummeling the bowery since at least the early 2000s, from the avalon luxury developments and its $3,000-per-month studios to the sprawling clubstaurant that is vandal, a behemoth that earns its riches by commercializing the street’s artistically populist ethos of yore. hot pot spots hawking expensive japanese beef certainly won’t solve any larger urban problems, alas. but inasmuch as the city continues to change, it’s good to see both older and younger chinese operators get in on the action, while still keeping things more accessible than their western counterparts.cost: soup base is $5-$6 per person. meat prices vary per cut. short rib or beef tongue is $10; prime ribeye is $13; hand-sliced lamb is $16; japanese wagyu is $80. most other selections — snapper, spam, noodles, mushrooms, and blue crab (packed with sweet roe) — run at $10 or less.sample dishes: spicy bang bang chicken, hot-stone wagyu beef, spicy lobster, grilled lamb skewers, japanese wagyu, prime ribeye, hand-sliced beef, tripe, snapper, blue crab, fried golden mantou buns with condensed milk.bonus tip: don’t sleep on the precooked spicy shellfish dishes — no hot pot swishing required. also: most tables have individual hamper baskets to protect coats and sweaters from the steam and aroma of fragrant sichuan peppercorns.cost: communal hot pots run from $15 (heady pumpkin seafood broth) to $18 (spicy szechuan beef tallow) to $23 (curated spicy beef tallow with a separate pot of pork bone broth). combo platters, which do not include soup base, cost anywhere from $45 (chicken, red clam, tilapia, vegetables) to $80 (with japanese wagyu, short ribs, lamb, abalone). a la carte wagyu is $65.sample dishes: master stock braised meat platter (duck feet, duck tongue, beef shanks, pig ears), mung bean noodles in chile paste, japanese wagyu, beef tripe, lamb, goat leg, short rib, berkshire pork shoulder, lychee ice cream.bonus tip: tang hotpot is smaller than zhen wei fang; be sure to book ahead via resy. also consider the $25 weekday lunch.sign up for our newsletter.with soggy fish and chips and an ammonia-tinged tartare, the british import manages to be the worst new restaurant in nyc this yearto comprehend the complex awfulness of bluebird london — a soulless, overpriced, and curiously packed british import at the time warner center — it helps to recall some vintage english sketch comedy. the actor rowan atkinson, in his famous “steak tartare” skit, contorts his face a thousand different ways while choking down a grayish patty of raw meat. instead of sending it back, however, he hides the remnants in a small tin of salt, in a woman’s pocketbook, and down the pants of a tableside violinist. everyone else in the restaurant is oblivious.the bit riffed on multiple themes, from food as an acquired taste to the shame of appearing insufficiently cultured in pompous environs. but there was arguably a plainer lesson tucked in there too: sometimes expensive cuisine is just bad, and it’s strange when no one else in the dining room seems to notice.such is the case at bluebird, the stateside debut of d&d london, one of the u.k.’s most prominent hospitality groups. it’s a sleek brasserie that, despite its manifestly dreadful food — from soggy fish and chips to blubbery duck — can fill up with hundreds of patrons during dj-fueled brunches. it’s also a venue that sent out a steak tartare so abominable, i struggled to keep it down.good tartare deploys powerful seasonings to highlight the subtleties of good steak. but the bluebird version i sampled leaned on spiced ketchup and capers to mask something on the verge of spoiling. the initial flavor was bland, quickly followed by a fetid, ammonia-like tang. it was an aroma that recalled room-temperature hamburger meat from a grocer that lost power. i felt my eyes water up as i chewed. i tried to swallow. i felt my entire gi tract prepare to purge. and then i regained my composure and pulled an atkinson, which is to say: i spat the nasty bits into a napkin and stuffed it into my briefcase.let me be clear: bluebird is new york’s worst new restaurant of 2018. for those who hoped to avoid this sort of thing anyway, keep in mind that next year, d&d will open up an 11,000-square-foot brasserie in the sprawling hudson yards complex.to be fair, the columbia circle venue, situated in the former a voce space, never promised culinary fireworks; the london original has always attracted more attention for its chic environs than its culinary accomplishments. bluebird in new york, true to form, is pretty. green booths are arranged in a sinuous s-shaped arrangement. bottles of gin stand on a plastic sculpture meant to evoke a human head. purple seats serve as vibrant accents against off-white sofas. and for select tables near the windows, nighttime diners get a brilliant view of central park south and trump tower. everyone else experiences obstructed vistas and dining-room reflections.clockwise, from top left: the dining room at bluebird, tuna poke bowl, lobster mac & cheesefor a blunter sense of the priorities here, consider the following: the restaurant’s website dedicates an entire page to the bios of the brunch entertainment. for example: dj sweat apparently faced off against an actor from the wire in a dj battle. now you know.the chef, in turn, is publicized with just two short words: his name, which i’ll respectfully withhold since the menu feels like it was cobbled together by a mercenary consultant or an ai-concocted algorithm instead of a culinary professional. what else could explain “brooklyn” charcuterie, “long island” burrata, poke bowls (of course there are poke bowls), or those infamous 2005-era favorites, lobster mac and cheese and truffle fries?the mac tastes like what would happen if a college student microwaved ziti with supermarket shellfish bisque and waxy pre-shredded cheese. as for the truffles, the black fungi shavings adhere to two or three mealy, undercooked fries like glue. and those poke bowls betray the good name of that hawaiian mainstay, typically a dice of raw fish bursting with notes from additions such as soy and sesame. instead, the blocks of tuna are as icy and insipid as the quinoa with which they’re paired; it tastes as if it died in the walk-in cooler.for a marginally better starter, try the foie gras terrine, though that would mean paying $34 for a few bites of liver over a pile of cold green beans and a single artichoke. the prevailing culinary ethos behind that appetizer seems to be: clean out the fridge. bluebird’s sleepy continental preparations are par for the course at the time warner center. as so many currents of diversity pulsate throughout the city’s dining scene — from modern chinese to new indian to creative vietnamese — this multibillion-dollar complex remains overwhelmingly european and shockingly exorbitant. it stands as a bulwark against the multi-ethnic traditions of nearby hell’s kitchen. there are, of course, outliers. david chang opened an affordable ramen shop here this year. and masa serves some pretty good sushi for those who’d like to spend $1,000 on a meal for one. those aside, the dining options here trend a bit monochromatic.across from bluebird, there’s a french bakery, a french cafe, and a french-italian brasserie. one floor above, there’s a gallic-american tasting temple where dinner runs $500 to $800 per person. and let’s not forget the bar that sells caviar, burgers, and filet mignon, located right next to an american steakhouse that also sells...caviar, burgers, and filet mignon. and at the mandarin oriental, there’s a duo of cocktail spots where a few rounds of drinks can cost more than a ski jacket, and a place called asiate, where the kitchen channels the global east by seasoning french food with lemongrass.diversity is not a driving force when a small group of humans at a multi-billion dollar real estate company curate the dining selections for many. that’s something to think about as the hudson yards complex nears completion. and that’s something to contemplate over a $65 strip, bluebird’s cheapest steak at dinner during a recent visit (now: $58). the cut lacks much of the compelling sweetness, complex char, or supremely beefy essence that dry-aged meats typically have; it’s a squishy cut of meat with an overpowering funk. i paired it with truffle madeira jus ($8) that had all the flavor of powdered onion soup mix. i also ordered fries, which prompted the kitchen to send out a second order of fries as a gift to this solo diner, for no particular reason. my two-course meal that night, with two drinks, cost $159 after tax and tip.in a city teeming with eurocentric gastropubs, trattorias, bistros, and brasseries, the opening of a new one raises the obvious question: what is it really adding to the our culinary scene? is it obsessed with moving the needle forward, like a frenchette? or is it dedicated to recreating the classics better than anyone else, like a la mercerie? it’s not hard, after all, to find an average terrine, cheese souffle, or burger in new york, and bluebird’s are all decidedly below average. the farmhouse pork pate recalls supermarket ham wrapped in old bread. the twice-baked comte souffle forgoes ethereal silkiness in favor of grittiness. and the burger suffers from an almost equal ratio of cheddar to beef; the bland patty is so undercooked it almost takes on the texture of warm fondue.roast duck for two ($98) arrives almost wholly unseasoned, with mealy flesh and a thick, under-rendered layer of fat. better is the lobster thermidor, whose delicately cooked meat packs tons of oceanic flavor — just be sure to eat around the leaden bechamel glaze, and understand you’re paying $38 for an appetizer’s worth of meat.if pressed to order anything at dinner, a mound of crab with trout roe expresses its maritime punch with aplomb. and at peak brunch, one can expect a great english breakfast — rich morcilla, porky sausages, baked tomatoes, sweet beans — as well as a dry pain au chocolat, a stale croissant, and a dj who spends more time checking his iphone than working the turntable. he looks bored. desserts are respectable enough, from the sticky toffee pudding, which is sufficiently sticky, to the classic bakewell tart, a blend of fragrant almond paste and orange marmalade. with a cup of tea, that pastry would be a civilized choice for a rainy afternoon in the city. otherwise, for a more reliable view of central park in an equally basic setting, try j.crew next door.cost: starters at $7-$34; mains at $23-$49; large format dishes at $95 (beef wellington), $98 (roasted duck), and $110 (cote de boeuf). dinner will easily run over $100 per person.sample dishes:  cheese sticks, ahi tuna poke bowl, fluke crudo, jonah crab with trout roe, farmhouse pork terrine, grilled lobster thermidor, fish & chips, twice baked comté cheese souffle, bakewell tart. bonus tip: come before sunset for more panoramic columbus circle and central park views from throughout the dining room.jenny kwak is a chef at the top of her game, moving deftly between traditional korean and actually exciting fusion fare in park slopeamid new york’s ever-globalizing culinary scene, a culture of cross-pollination continues to thrive. the city’s finest barbecue shack sells not just texas brisket but stellar jerk pork. an ambitious indian spot in gramercy sends out pitch-perfect tandoori chicken — and guacamole to boot. an asian rotisserie in midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox. and now at haenyeo, a knockout of a korean hangout in park slope, the kitchen whips up bouillabaisse as masterful as that of any gallic temple. chef-owner jenny kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic french soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and pernod. the rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. a filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in marseille — glutinous rice cakes. mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. and then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen. the warmth of the stew doubles the urchin’s natural sugars and triples its musk. at this point you might search for the traditional bouillabaisse accompaniment of croutons with rouille to add a bit of garlicky cream and crunch to the stew. except there’s none of that here. kwak instead presents a baguette slathered with seaweed butter. let it soak in the broth, then appreciate how the sweet nori enriches the mixture.if that’s still too european, kwak offers more traditional dishes too, from bulgogi to raw fish bibimbap bowls — alongside with mexican-leaning fundidos and louisiana-style shellfish. haenyeo might take its name from the women who free-dive for seafood off of korea’s jeju island, but its approach to cuisine is often decidedly and unabashedly internationalist.park slope’s collection of korean restaurants is still small, which is fitting. that country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of east village representation there before kwak and her mother, myung ja kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. the duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd street. the mother-daughter team opened up dok suni’s on first avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.writers praised their efforts, though they sometimes used language that should’ve come across as troublesome then, as it is now. new york magazine’s fran schumer began her suni’s review with this slight: “you’d rather have spaghetti than kimchi any day, but there are times when cold pickled cabbage tastes that good.” new york times critic william grimes lauded kwak’s use of tasting menus to “demystify” korean food at do hwa in the west village. “for years the city’s korean restaurants made no concessions to newcomers, who faced a struggle figuring out what the dishes were, how to order them and how to eat them,” he wrote in 2000. food will always adapt, but pointing out a particular cuisine’s so-called lack of concessions or instructions is a dicier affair. that said, the korean restaurant community has evolved over the decades — as have the journalists covering it. it’s been ages since a reviewer has used the word “forbidding” in association with any of these fine venues, or (unnecessarily) mentioned that the waiters “speak english well.”korean fried chicken is about as ubiquitous as any other style. a certain galbi-slinging barbecue spot in flatiron is harder to get into than any local steakhouse. a multibillion-dollar real estate complex is selling ’grammable rice cakes shaped like pinwheels. and late last year marked the debut of haenyeo, whose kitchen exhibits a stunning fluency in alternating between more traditional and more modern, fusion-y preparations. there’s something profoundly warming about walking past a bustling al di la, the italian pride of park slope, and noticing that haenyeo across the street is no less packed. miles davis pipes through the sound system as families eat fried scallops with corn tartare — an “is-it-summer-yet” melange of oceanic and terrestrial sugars — and scallion pancakes; the slices of spicy onion are held together with so little batter they’re effectively modernist tempura sculptures. the corner space, with handsome brown floor planks, french-style bar stools, and ample natural light, screams neighborhood cafe, and that’s partly the plan. haenyeo will open for lunch and brunch this summer, serving up coffee and eggs with “jambalaya rice.” for now, it’s dinner only, with a no-reservations policy for most party sizes. the wait on saturdays can surpass 90 minutes.anyone who tries the oysters will understand the pulsating crowds. kwak grills them over hardwood briquettes, a hat tip to the new orleans heritage of her husband, terrence segura, with whom she shares ownership. she’s not the first person to do this in new york, but she might be the most skilled. the wellfleet bivalves display an aggressive plumpness; they pop with a gentle press of the tongue, gushing with hot seaweed butter.equally stunning is the rustic-internationalist take on fundido, typically a glorious gut bomb of melted cheese. here, that ingredient constitutes just the epidermal layer of a deeper, bubbling casserole. beneath the scorched cheese, an aggressively milky oaxacan variety, lies a pool of chile sauce and mounds of tteokbokki, oblong korean rice cakes. pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface. the combination of flavors and textures — chewy rice cakes, hot peppers, tart sauce, spiced sausage, and stretchy, melty cheese — feels like less of a true fundido and more of a korean-mexican riff on baked ziti. then, a moment later, kwak switches gear to modern-refined fare. she serves ordinary grilled mackerel in a very distinct way, by pairing it with square sheets of nori. the mackerel is soft and neutral, boasting gently smoky overtones. it’s borderline boring until you wrap it in seaweed, which imparts the fish with a hint of brine and a crisp, snappy texture. you dunk the hand roll, a striking contrast of white and green, in crimson gochujang paste, lighting up the palate with salt and sweet chiles.the menu has a few minor misses, from run-of-the-mill beef kimchi gyoza — ordinary fried dumplings — to a bland mound of chile-braised tofu. better are the puffy fried chicken bites laced with jalapenos, as well as the korean seafood stew, a smaller, more classic answer to the fancier bouillabaisse. the soup, chock full of silky soybean curd and firm shrimp, is milder in flavor than the spendier french version, sporting just a touch of shellfish concentrate. and then there is the classic soy-and-sesame-marinated ribeye bulgogi, cut paper-thin and piled high on a platter for wrapping in crisp lettuce and shiso leaves.louisiana-style beignets are the appropriate way to end a meal here. the dough itself is relatively unsweetened, giving the confections the taste of a classic street-fair zeppole. so much powdered sugar is applied that you will inhale some as you eat. “not korean” is the disclaimer that kwak appends to her instagrams of that dessert. “for me, staying true or preserving korean flavors is the main goal,” the chef writes in an email. but she adds that “there are so many influences around me, mostly from traveling but even from living in nyc,” that she allows herself more room to experiment than she did earlier in career. may she continue to do so.cost: starters at $9-$16; larger share plates at $16-$34. seaweed baguette is a (worthwhile) $6 supplement to the $29 bouillabaisse.sample dishes: sauteed glass noodles in sesame, rice cake fundido with chorizo, scallion pancake, grilled oysters with seaweed butter, grilled mackerel with nori, spicy winter bouillabaisse, thinly sliced ribeye with lettuce wraps, sugar-dusted beignets.bonus tip: reservations only available for six or more; the best way to avoid the wait is to dine earlier in the week, in the off hours, or best of all, at the bar, where things are first come, first served.pinsa, the thin and crispy pizza famous in rome, is the specialty heremontesacro pinseria is a serious roman restaurant masquerading as a pizzeria. the pizza, of course, is the almost faddish pinsa, an oblong flop of well-browned dough made from a combination of wheat, rice, and soy flour, tracing its roots back to ancient rome. part of a mini chain that includes another branch in portland, the restaurant was founded in san francisco in 2015, and claims to be the first pinseria in the united states.our branch — run by owner gianluca legrottaglie, chef riccardo buitoni, and wine director emanuele tibaldo — lies in central williamsburg, just above the lorimer l stop on union avenue. if the place seems eerily familiar, that’s because it was the former and much-missed bistro dumont. now, the front room is quiet and serene, with a bar running along one side and an open kitchen at the end of the room, so open you can reach in and grab a loaf of freshly made bread, warm, moist, and with a dense crumb.but a crooked hallway runs around the kitchen to the place most diners settle down: the covered rear patio. with a black interior and bright spotlights, it feels like an airport runway at midnight. the patio seats 70 or so, and potted plants are scattered here and there. big tables can be easily pushed together into bigger tables, where groups seeking post-work pizza hunker down, with huzzahs rising up to the retractable ceiling.let’s ignore the pinsa for a minute. romans are very fond of variety meats, and evidence of this is a marvelous pig head roulade ($11), composed of smoky and greasy swirls of white fat and pink flesh. there’s also a tripe dish, roman-style in a cheesy tomato sauce. what’s the difference between it and the famed tripe of florence? well, roman tripe is further seasoned with fresh mint, an herb often seen in roman cooking. you’ll be seeing more of it at montesacro.unless incorporated onto a pinsa, vegetables ($13 to $16) will not be the most memorable aspect of your meal. most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal romanesco, also undercooked; and brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. the notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash. it gets crumbed like tempura, making the mellow orange vegetable crunchy and soft at the same time, and then dribbled with honey and heaped with grated cheese. get three orders and it could happily be your entire meal.pastas play an important, if minor, role on the bill of fare, and all i’ve tasted have been unfailingly excellent. closely associated with rome, egg-yolky carbonara ($18) shines yellow in its bowl, dotted with cured guanciale in little salty tidbits and poured over mezze maniche, stunted tubules that trap more sauce than the spaghetti traditionally used. the effect is like breakfast bacon and eggs.but make sure you examine the easy-to-miss special menu, which flaps on a tiny slip of paper stapled to the regular one. special pastas have included potato gnocchi, soft as a winter mitten, mired in a fibrous beef cheek sauce that clings in great globs to the pasta, and burrata-filled ravioli lavished with fresh chanterelles and grated truffle pecorino. at $20 for a substantial serving, how can the restaurant afford to offer it?the five-item list of specials that day was particularly compelling due to its component of fresh mushrooms, served at just the season when they’re harvested in italy. this is meta-restaurateuring at its best, meaning certain indefinable features besides the food will transport you to rome. there was also a wild boar chop in a ragu of fresh porcinis, and a pinsa that featured italian sausage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. a friend and i ordered all three mushroom specials that evening and enjoyed a fungal orgy.there are only three proper secondi: a fish, a steak, and a chicken. the waiter warned us away from the steak, which comes in a salsa verde more appropriate to florentine cooking. you might choose the crisp-skinned chicken pressed under a brick instead, but conventional entrees here will never be the highlight of your meal.inevitably, we come to the pinsas. the variety is vast, and the individual diner will pick the pizza with the combination of ingredients that pleases her most. i can see digging the one with broccoli rabe and spicy sausage (maranella, $20), or the pie that sports tomatoes, fried eggplant, and two kinds of cheese, including the unmeltable ricotta salata (portonaccio, $19).i selected instead a pinsa that’s assembled after the pie comes out of the oven, making the toppings warm but not hot. you won’t burn your tongue out of eagerness on the garbatella ($21), which features wads of really great albacore tuna, purple onions, and caper mayonnaise. yes, it tastes like the world’s best tuna salad sandwich. another favorite outlier merits a special box by itself on the menu — focaccia der muratore, wherein a thin layer of pinsa dough sheaths slices of mortadella. for bologna lovers, this is pig heaven.besides pizzeria and roman restaurant, montesacro enjoys a further identity as a wine bar. the list has many diverting specimens that would go well with pizza. unfortunately, many tend to be a little pricey for this usage, including a nero d’avola and an etna rosso from sicily ($60 and $70, respectively), reds with a flinty taste issuing from volcanic soils. other wines come from spain, france, turkey, slovenia, and chile, but the one that drinks best with pizza, to my taste, is a fizzy and almost sweet red lambrusco ($48) from the emilia-romagna producer vecchia modena.on the other hand, you should never be ashamed of eating your pinsa the way romans often do, with that venerable roman beverage, coca-cola. only in this case, it will be a bottle of mexican coke.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, one pinsa, and one pasta, plus two glasses of wine and tax but not tip, $90. sample dishes: porchetta (herby roast pork), zucca frita (delicata squash), garbatella pinsa (tuna and caper mayonnaise), pollo al mattone (chicken under a brick).what to drink: any sparkling wine by the bottle or glass, white grechetto from lazio, draft pilsner beer, or bottled spanish cider.bonus tip: while you won’t have room, there are some commendable desserts, including a panna cotta flavored with dried fennel, and navel-shaped biscotti that come with a free glass of red wine. drink and dip.  red paper clip is busy and filled with promise, but two blue hill alum chefs aren’t fulfilling them yetnot too long into dinner at red paper clip, an asian-leaning tasting-menu spot in the west village, a server brings over an ash-colored plate decorated with white swirls of yogurt and scattered herbs. “carrot katsu,” he says. this is unusual, not just because this breadcrumb-enriched cutlet is typically made with pork or chicken, but rather because this style of japanese cooking isn’t frequently seen at a bastion of expensive eating — unless it involves a fat slab of luxurious wagyu. the katsu packs a deeper, denser crunch than a more cloud-like piece of tempura. the exterior, however, quickly yields to a softer orange interior, at once vaguely sweet and savory. those swirls of yogurt, in turn, add a soothing tang, while shiso oil conveys a minty, licorice-tinged perfume. on a good night, it easily ranks as one of the better katsu dishes in a town, and it shows that a more rustic japanese dish like this one is just as deserving of a place on a tasting menu as a slice of blow-torched tuna neck. on a bad night, however, the carrots are undercooked and cloying. the aroma of the shiso is flat. and the conversation ends there, a disappointing conclusion to an exciting idea. “these are black truffles from oregon,” a waiter announces a few minutes later, shaving them over something dubbed xiaolongbao agnolotti. it’s a cross between the italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. you pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. it never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. and at $95 for the tasting, the price isn’t too shabby either.the two-month-old red paper clip, an uneven solo debut from kevin chen and tashi gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. one is about a duo of blue hill at stone barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. as sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while luthun in the west village and reverence in harlem represent newer entrants to the field. and while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to red paper clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. the people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.the presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of china. chen, a native new yorker of taiwanese descent, and gyamtso, who was raised in tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves cantonese, shanghainese, and himalayan ingredients with those from france, italy, japan, and elsewhere. that’s no small matter. while a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of taiwan, hong kong, and the mainland, chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.a waiter shaves black truffles over xlb agnolotti.tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.but the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. a restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. and inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their western (or japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see chen and gyamtso prove folks wrong.there are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. corey lee’s benu in san francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while kato in los angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other taiwanese delicacies. but in new york, an expression of chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of xo sauce here, a dab of indiscernible sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.it’s for this reason that one might scoff at red paper clip’s sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. a sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. and finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an estela or a wildair, but its dna feels sichuan through and through.then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. it’s just another carpaccio.here’s simplicity at its best: chen and gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. this infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. things are quite lovely. until they’re not. during another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of september. underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that chen and gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. red paper clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. or consider the lobster three ways. there’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. the butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. and the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.that criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. they have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. an act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. but it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. the late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. the kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. these “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. whimsical moments like these suggest that red paper clip will eventually find its groove. for now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.cost: the dining room is tasting-only at $95 (gratuity is extra). the bar menu includes a tight collection of small plates at $18-$37.sample dishes: nori fettuccine with maitake, carrot katsu, sichuan beef carpaccio, agnolotti xiaolongbao, lobster three ways, smoked short rib with fermented greens and yeasted potato.bonus tip: there is currently no list of wines by the bottle; the restaurant, rather, employs a “human wine list,” with whom you discuss your preferences. patrons, of course, are handicapped by not knowing the range of prices. (“this isn’t intentional; we haven’t gotten around to putting together the list,” a bartender says.) in the meantime, go by the glass.chef erik ramirez’s village hot spot beautifully delivers on nikkei fare, a style rarely seen in new yorkambitious modern sushi is typically a very specific thing in new york. that is: a traditional and expensive omakase parlor hawking exquisitely butchered fish, much of it endangered bluefin, over vinegared rice. sushi at llama san in greenwich village, however, is a very different thing. the stunner of a peruvian spot offers just a single type of nigiri, forged from duck, cilantro, and fried banana.there is no chef standing solemnly behind a counter, doling out pristine morsels piece by piece. chef erik ramirez simply sends his creations into the blonde-wood dining room, where fiona apple’s “criminal” pipes through the sound system. a staffer walks to and fro waving burning palo santo sticks, blessing the space with pungent smoke. four nasturtium leaves, so green they’re practically glowing, seem to hover above the plate. under each one lies the sushi: a mound of coriander rice below a sheath of paper-thin duck breast. the perfume of coriander hits the palate first, then the savoriness of the rice, then the the earthy essence of aged waterfowl. and just when the gaminess starts to creep up, the banana, tucked between the grains and the bird like a pat of wasabi, issues a whisper of sweetness. this is sushi that’s as worthy of critical contemplation as any toro hand roll. and while llama san offers an omakase that runs $500 for two after drinks, the duck nigiri is only available a la carte, for $24.from top left: nasturtium sitting over aged duck nigiri; patrons gathering in a packed bar room; head bartender natasha bermudez placing an ice cube in a palo santo-filled glassperuvian restaurants constitute a vital part of new york-area restaurant landscape, furnishing everything from grilled skewers to tart ceviches to rotisserie chickens. what ramirez is doing at llama san, however, constitutes a branch of andean cuisine with less obvious (if growing) stateside representation. that style of cooking is called nikkei, a fusion of peruvian and japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the south american country’s culinary ethos. scores of japanese people emigrated to peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to u.s. internment camps during world war ii.generations later, myriad sushi and udon spots thrive from cusco to arequipa. anyone who’s been to a nobu has encountered some form of nikkei. its chef brought worldwide fame to tiradito (sashimi) with rocoto chile paste and filet mignon with zippy anticucho sauce. but while nobu has turned into a blandly internationalist chain that bills its food as japanese, llama san proudly calls itself nikkei, exhibiting a deeper level of virtuosity in the style.ramirez slicks translucent rice noodles in a sesame soy vinaigrette. they slurp up easily until a sucker punch of pepper pricks the tongue. he douses crimson cubes of tuna in ponzu; they seem to pulsate with the nuclear level of soy and yuzu. he pairs fried iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. and he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. the mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.his tofu acts as an essay in the colors yellow and white. a rectangular block of soy curd covers a mash of shrimp mousse, while a golden pool of garlicky seafood sauce imparts warmth. rice crackers hide a pile of tender lobster, displaying a charcoal-grilled singe, and smoky chunks of corazon — no gamier than skirt steak. it’s a surf and turf like no other; the shellfish jus and beefy heart drippings, fortified with oregano and vinegar, enrich a serving of sushi rice underneath.hand rolls are not uncommon in nikkei cuisine, but the way ramirez prepares them is. he takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. the combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.ramirez has emerged as the city’s most studied and satisfying purveyor of modern peruvian in all its diverse forms. he serves up beef corazon skewers at williamsburg’s llama inn; shrimp noodles and rotisserie birds at llamita in the west village; and now, at llama san, a compact menu of creative and visually striking small plates. most people in the dining room will justifiably only order off of the a la carte menu. but llama san also offers a $150 omakase, a rare south american tasting in new york. the 10-course meal largely pulls from the regular menu and is best for solo diners who want to experience the brilliance of llama san in a single sitting.the meal kicks off with a bite of kaluga caviar between two crisps. the kitchen could have easily let the roe stand alone; instead, it’s paired with a swatch of miso manjar blanco — a south american dulce du leche of sorts. purists might recoil at this combination, but the mix of oceanic brine and aromatic sugars is simply a perfumed riff on a sea salt-laced caramel.ramirez also sneaks in an off-menu oyakadon, a japanese chicken-over-rice bowl, which he crosses with estofado de pollo, a peruvian poultry stew. for this, he uses gizzards. japanese restaurants love to highlight the snappy texture of the digestive organ, but llama san takes a more rustic tact, braising them until they’re barely firmer than a chicken nugget. the little knobs, which flaunt just an inkling of poultry funk, sit sandwiched between an egg omelet and a layer of rice. the flavor profile recalls sweet tamago sushi crossed with rich sausage.does one need a hefty plate of wagyu short rib after six previous courses? probably not, and perhaps ramirez should consider showing off his stronger dishes, like the surf and turf or iberico, instead of ending yet another manhattan tasting menu with this ubiquitous luxury. that said, llama san sends out an impressively beefy cut, fortified with what might be the world’s greatest potato salad, which is laced with bites of squishy egg and tiny, sweet shrimp.ramirez operates with just as much skill at dessert, showering an undulating blob of custard with fanta-colored satsuma ice and halved gooseberries. the combination speaks to its component flavors: the egginess of the cream, the cool citrus punch of the granita, and the rampant acidity of the pulpy fruit. i ask the waiter if it’s based on a peruvian dessert. she responds that it’s based on a creamsicle. right on.older, fancier tasting spots cap off dinner with a flurry of petits fours. llama san instead offers a single bite and a shot of booze: a matcha truffle infused with muña (andean mint) and a few sips of pisco. the candy’s dusty exterior boasts a tannic astringency, but that bitterness quickly yields to a soft, buttery, grassy interior. the accompanying liquor parries the sugary blow. a restaurant doesn’t need to send out a mignardise to qualify as “fancy” or “good,” but inasmuch as the wagyu crowd considers this sort of thing as a signifier of luxury, ramirez and company are arguing that they can tango with the best of them. indeed, they can.cost: most dishes in the $20s and $30s. expect to spend about $100 per person or more for about three to four courses for each diner. the tasting runs $150 and must be booked in advance.sample dishes: scallop ceviche with cherimoya, tuna with ponzu, duck nigiri with fried banana, tofu with shrimp mousse and chile sauce, beef hearts and lobster over sushi rice, chicken thigh maki, iberico pork tonkatsu, creamsicle dessert.bonus tip: bar seating during prime time is often reserved via resy; check the app for cancellations. just the same, for a more sushi-heavy nikkei experience in new york, with omakase services as well, consider midtown’s sen sakana.keith mcnally’s restaurant reboot delivers charisma, gold-tinged nostalgia, and a familiar brasserie experience to a changed new yorkvoila: what was once an entire food hall, with myriad vendors and ample seating, is now a single chic french brasserie with two-hour waits. welcome to pastis 2.0, the rebirth of keith mcnally’s downtown gem that you might’ve first learned about (like i did) because lindsay lohan and other a-listers were slurping onion soup there in the aughts. the new location, run by mega-restaurateur stephen starr, sends out roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers a few blocks away from the old location, which was torn down to make way for a luxury home goods retailer that, on its rooftop, serves roast chicken, shrimp cocktail, and drippy burgers. really, this is a certain segment of new york in a nutshell: more of the same. the thing is, in the case of pastis, it’s generally a good kind of same.the first incarnation, which fueled the nightly party that is the meatpacking district, was born in 1999 as a balthazar sequel of sorts. it simultaneously functioned as an affordable-ish hangout in an increasingly expensive nabe — remember when samantha from sex and the city revealed she paid $7,000 per month in rent here? — and a constant celebrity magnet. the partying was wild at times, but it never truly devolved into the type of rich kids of instagram debauchery that nearby spots became known for; there were no dance-party brunches where magnums of champagne came with sparklers or where jeroboams (if you don’t know what that is, you can’t afford one) triggered recognition by the dj.by meatpacking standards, pastis was chill and inviting. it still is.when a hip burger spot i no longer patronize turned us away in 2005, pastis took us in. and so we feasted on bacon-loaded tripe and drank stoli orange martinis (woof). things are a touch more crowded these days; a line of aspirants regularly snakes toward the door. no reservation? you’ll get quoted a multi-hour wait, though a host concedes that they hold back tables for regulars. now you know: be a regular. or be here at lunch when it’s quieter. or be famous. the second coming, like the first, remains a brilliantly fashionable place to people-watch. why hello there, dan abrams and ex-men’s health dude-itor dave zinczenko (or his doppelganger), bro-ing it up in a booth. such antics are more enjoyable than the filet au poivre, which is sometimes grayish and medium when ordered medium-rare, sometimes cold and blue when ordered rare. but the creamy pepper sauce covers up the flaws well enough, and oh, wait, is that john mayer? at a table surrounded by women? sounds about right. let me munch on some bland king crab, and whoa, gosh, what a nice mop of hair that mayer boy has. another $16 daiquiri? sure, why not.the space is a near replica of the old one, from the worn wood planks to the dark banquettes to the zinc bar to every other detail that suggests the venue is 40 years old and not a few months young. mcnally, who recently quipped that people go out to eat to escape their spouses, has hung so many artfully worn mirrors that getting caught cheating here is assured. buy me a hard seltzer one day, and i’ll tell you about the nearby celebrity cuddled up to a person who was not their spouse. that duo, with their aristocratic cheekbones, looked fabulous. so did everyone else. anyone who’s dined at mcnally’s restaurants knows they’re lit in a very particular type of gold, a hue that suggests that, somewhere in france, a quaint town exists where it is perpetually twilight. on a recent evening, after a glass of muscadet, i reached for a carafe filled with what appeared to be more of the precious liquid. alas, it was a jug of water, magically turned to wine by amber bulbs that make everything soft and fuzzy.pastis, in short, looks, feels, and tastes like the old pastis. or the current balthazar. it is a piece of nostalgia for an era that still exists, and for a type of food that is neither threatened nor in short supply. starr seems like a logical partner. he runs some of the city’s most distinctive and ambitious gallic spots, fueling the haute throwback ways of daniel rose’s le coucou and the classic-modern cafe vibes of marie-aude rose’s la mercerie. pastis, of course, is neither distinctive nor ambitious. it sends out basic, mostly well-executed brasserie fare. there is a pedigreed chef, but there is no bio on the website, no waiters who speak about him in reverent tones. they simply tell you how awesome the croque madame is. it is awesome. the haute ham and cheese sandwich — fat slices of toasted brioche, salty jambon, gooey gruyere, and a sunny-side-up egg — functions as effectively at breakfast, lunch, or dinner.pastis has “devised a menu so traditional that virtually every dish could qualify for protection by the french ministry of culture,” new york times food critic william grimes wrote in 2000. the statement could as easily apply to the 2019 offerings: tangy beef tartare, cardboard shrimp cocktail, nutty trout almandine, cloying, one-note bouillabaisse that tastes like it never met saffron. and snails. the snails are hot. they sit in little tubs of oil that bubble at the table. to watch someone consume an escargot too quickly is to watch the real-life version of wile e. coyote swallowing an acme bomb. let them cool, then let them squish around in your mouth like the amphibious garlic sponges that they are.those who order tuna ravigote will be no less pleased. a crimson circle of raw fish nearly takes up the circumference of a plate, lying underneath a verdant pile of mint, tarragon, basil, chive, and dill. herring, by contrast, tells its story more rustically, as a series of masterfully butchered slices matched with halved potatoes. it is a fine study in salt, smoke, and maritime gelatins.should you order the roast chicken? probably. the aggressive brining leaves the breast with a faintly springy texture, but after dredging the meat through rich jus, you won’t notice such details. the pairing is a giant bowl of mashed potatoes, equally buttery and starchy. but best of all are the lobster frites. the chefs roast a two-pound lobster, rip out its meat, drizzle it with about three pounds of garlic butter, and garnish it with fries for dunking. it tastes the way a good lobster should: like a sweetened version of the atlantic ocean.for dessert, order baba au rhum. a quenelle of cream looks like a cumulus cloud that’s about to be munched by an oblong pac-man cake. this being baba, the cake is naturally doused in rum. lots of rum. i’ve had baba just about everywhere, and can say without qualms that this is the only place where there is enough booze leftover to do a half a shot from the bowl. one feels buzzed afterwards. i like this place better than the old food hall.cost: starters $14-$28; mains $22-$59; desserts $12-$13. expect to spend about $100 or more per person after drinks, tax, and tip.sample dishes: tuna crudo, steak tartare, onion soup, snails with garlic butter, lobster frites, trout amandine, grilled lamb steak, filet au poivre.bonus tip: if the hosts quote a multi-hour wait, tell the bartender you’re looking to dine; the wait shouldn’t be longer than an hour. otherwise, scan resy for cancellations. also keep in mind that pastis might just be closed for an unannounced private event the night you show up.the greenwich village mainstay is seemingly stuck in the past, even with a new menu from chef victoria blameythe sale of foie gras — a fatty indulgence that punches you in the gut, steals your money, and tries to make you feel good about that transaction — will soon be illegal in new york city. most restaurants, however, won’t have to do much to comply. force-fed duck livers don’t enjoy as much popularity among young culinarians, a class of hospitality types that turns to nimbler luxuries like uni, abalone, and truffles. in fact, simply encountering foie on a new restaurant menu is somewhat rare.gotham bar & grill is an uncommon establishment in this regard. foie takes center stage at the famed american venue. this is all the more surprising given that the greenwich village fixture, for the first time in 34 years, boasts an ambitious new chef: victoria blamey, who takes over from alfred portale. blamey lets foie show off its sweet side, juxtaposing it against saltier, chewier ham hock. for a more savory affair, she glazes the product with a layer of truffled seaweed gelee, imparting the stomach-distending, main course-sized appetizer with bass notes of earthiness. and in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin. it’s a fine ode to 1996, when gotham paired this delicacy with guinea hen or squab, or to 2013, when the restaurant featured a trio of simultaneous foie preparations as well.excess is the point of this extravagance, and blamey prepares it well. but as a legacy restaurant looks toward the future, perhaps a wallet-busting old-school indulgence shouldn’t occupy so much real estate on a tight bill of fare. and while the poussin-foie is now gone, there’s still something retro about the larger framework of the venue, a contemporary greenmarket restaurant serving two big steaks and two types of caviar while offering just a single vegetarian main.“in a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, gotham bar and grill is an outlier,” wrote new york times critic sam sifton in 2011. it was, in his words, a restaurant that celebrated “stability and excellence.” and while the owners in 2019 decided to seek change — a claim backed up by hiring blamey — sifton’s assessment still largely holds true.portale, in his early reign, ranked among the most influential and envelope-pushing new american chefs. in the mid-’80s, he acted as an early champion of seasonal, local fare. and more famously, he built dishes vertically, constructing seafood salads as if they were edible marie antoinette wigs. but even as gotham trended more internationalist in the 21st century, its influence waned amid the brash, stripped-down small-plates era of the aughts and beyond.the acquisition of a younger chef, who built a reputation for whimsical and inventive tavern fare at chumley’s, could have been an opportunity for a full reset. but notwithstanding a touch of high acid here, a bit of maine uni there, and smart smattering of chiles everywhere, it’s not clear this is truly blamey’s establishment. gotham very much remains gotham, minus any long-faded excellence.counterclockwise, from top left: patrons dining under puffy chandeliers; chef victoria blamey plating a dish during service; beef tartare underneath crispy tendon; diners perusing the menu in the rear dining areayes, the dishes are new, but this is still a big restaurant with big portions, big prices, a bar longer than some entire east village restaurants, a lounge menu with an epic crab galette, and a fortified host stand operated by four people who look like they spearhead j.p. morgan’s private wealth management division.on the way to your table, you pass under puffy fabric chandeliers, past a party of five guys (each of them wearing blue-collared button-downs), past three gray-haired men in suits (two of them order the foie), and up and down a few stairs. a waiter is quick to mention they are sold out of the $90 caviar, and can only offer the $140 version.sometimes the food feels in sync with both new and old gastronomy. the kitchen laces beef tartare with confit tomato, showers it with fluffy gran queso, and tops it off with a wavy tendon chicharon. the layering recalls the altitude of portale’s architectural tuna tartare, but in a way that’s distinctly, well, blamey. but on those rare occasions when the menu feels loose and modern, the service takes a strange and stodgy turn. if a party of three has one man and two women, should a host really ask: “will the gentleman sit in the middle?” should servers say things like, “i’ll bring a cocktail list for the lady?” should a waiter really ask me, the only male at the table, about whether to clear the wine list after a female companion does all the ordering? should he make eye contact only with me when asking to clear a course? does gotham require that certain staffers follow robert’s rules of order (1876) in addressing guests by the third person? if so, ryan sutton doesn’t like it.a modern restaurant seamlessly weaves meat-free (or meat-light) dishes into its offerings, prompting diners of all stripes to order them without qualms. gotham instead sends out dishes that can feel like obligatory concessions to those with dietary restrictions. beet kimchi ribbons, tomato, and trout roe sit over a pile of stracciatella doing a bland impression of cream cheese. the result is a preparation that tastes like a failed take on a 1980s chevre and beet salad. lapsang souchong adds a whisper of smokiness to japanese eggplant with sea island peas, but for naught. the dish is simply a bland, mushy mess (though on another visit, it boasts a more complex roundness and tang). pea dal, in turn, sit in a rich bath of coconut milk and curry leaf oil. it’s a preparation that begs for naan or rice — or really anything to placate the grainy wallop. at gotham, it comes with nothing. it is simply a thick, gritty, unbalanced stew of legumes, an incomplete side dish posing as a composed appetizer.the good news, however, is that the sole vegetarian entree showcases blamey at her best. she chars caraflex cabbage, drenches it in brown butter, pairs it with a seaweed gremolata, and throws everything over firm beads of fregola pasta. the dish is a striking blend of starch, smoke, restrained fat, and buzzing savoriness.ruth reichl, in her own three-star review over two decades ago, described the mains as “straightforward,” a qualifier that still feels apt in 2019. madai (sea bream) expresses itself as a run-of-the-mill, “here’s a clunky slab of overcooked fish” over a zingy green tomato and poblano sauce. better is slow-cooked lamb shoulder. it shows off the animal’s agrarian musk with greater degree than most fancy spots, while a calabrian chile sauce lights the palate ablaze. it would be a perfect four-bite starter. as a more herculean main, though, it feels burdensome.and then there’s the foie gras-laced poussin, whose breast mimicked the texture of overcooked tofu dragged through sand.at the bar, a shorter collection of dishes shows off the calculated risk-taking that blamey was renowned for at chumley’s. her spreadable boar rillette packs equal parts funk and heat; it is like an american answer to ’nduja. she stuffs smoked sturgeon into little “everything” eclairs for an haute hat tip to ashkenazi appetizing traditions (currently off the menu). she douses raw scallops in citrus and granada chile, resulting in what might be the city’s most wonderfully pungent and peppery ceviche. the true showstopper is the crab galette, a riff on the traditional chupe stew of chile, blamey’s native country. a puffy disc of pastry yields to a thick layer of pulled dungeness meat. the flesh is laced with chartreuse, tomato, and chile. while an ordinary crabcake often feels lethargic on the palate, her pie hums with acid, spice, and the rich taste of the sea. on a good night, at least. a repeat sampling resulted in more muted flavors.for dessert, consider the souffle. no denser than soft meringue, it shows off a whiff of perfumed peach, checked by the farmer’s funk of tart sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream. a tarte tatin for two does everything that’s expected of it, employing soft, flaky, buttery pastry as a conveyance mechanism for bouncy, caramelized, autumnally aromatic apples. but pain perdu, alas, functions as a pedestrian elevation of the classic french toast dish, albeit for $15. it feels like a dessert that could come from any fancy restaurant from 2009 or 1999. and that pretty much sums up gotham. the establishment isn’t so much moving the culinary scene forward as it is acting as an ode to itself. for a restaurant of a certain age and its patrons, that’s probably okay. let them eat foie gras.cost: starters at $17-$29; mains at $27-$55; most desserts at $15. those prices exclude caviar ($90-$140), steak for two ($135), the souffle ($22), and the tarte tatin for two ($28). expect to spend about $125-$150 per person in the main dining room, and a bit less in the bar room.sample dishes: scallop ceviche, foie gras with seaweed and truffle gelee, beef tartare with tendon, charred eggplant with sea island pea, elysian fields lamb shoulder, caraflex cabbage, peach souffle with sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream.bonus tip: the restaurant is reasonably busy, and sometimes packed, on any given night, but the expansiveness of the space means that same-day tables aren’t too tough to come by on resy; gotham also accommodates walk-ins both at the bar and the dining room.the restaurant is a foil to its flashier upstairs sibling, estiatorio milos, offering a far more generous ideation of a mall restaurantto dine at estiatorio milos in hudson yards, one of the city’s most expensive seafood restaurants, is to witness the efforts of a small army. over 130 staffers tend to fire-spitting grills, butcher whole fish, turn entire mackerel into tartare a la minute, and carve up turbot tableside in mere moments. to dine downstairs at milos wine bar, however, is to witness a very different ballet, and arguably a more compelling one. just two or so chefs prepare every item on the much shorter menu. they slice raw tuna and anoint it with yuzu kosho. they lay a sinuous octopus tentacle on a wicked-hot grill. they drizzle madagascar prawns with olive oil. they shave succulent pork off a rotating spit for gyros. for this four-course feast, plus two glasses of wine, tax, and tip, you pay just $88. that much wouldn’t buy you half a lobster pasta upstairs at dinner.i had strong words for estiatorio milos shortly after it opened, and again today. no matter how grand (or average) your mediterranean-tinged meal there might be, you always feel cheated. milos wine bar is the less opulent endeavor. there’s no view of the vessel or the hudson river; the space simply overlooks the mall’s empty interior. but the wine bar is also the more affordable and generous concept. not a single item rises above $16. that octopus the chef was grilling evidences as much technical expertise as other business-class cephalopods around town. there’s that purplish exterior, like a crisp baguette with suction cups; the middle layer of gelatin, ever-so squishy; and the meaty interior, firm and juicy. all that’s missing is that gas grill “kiss” from upstairs. here it’s $10. there it’s $32. taramasalata, a greek feat that takes briny cod roe and olive oil and transforms it into a product that’s silkier than hummus, is only available as part of a trio of spreads upstairs. the cost? thirty-nine dollars. here, it’s available alone, with warm pita, for $10. everything about the wine bar is an axiomatic argument against the absurd pricing of the main dining room.this includes the wines themselves. milos upstairs offers 11 whites by the glass, more than half of them at $17 or more. getting ahold of a waiter to order one (or a cocktail) sometimes means eating through half a $100 entree, sans beverage. but the wine bar downstairs offers at least 30 whites (and 37 reds) by the glass, with the bulk below $15; a few hover just below $10. every selection is greek, a bonus in a city where hellenic wines don’t get the representation that they deserve.it’s also a rare menu to offer meaningful tasting notes, detailing the rose-petal notes of a greek moschofilero (whose high acidity will cut through a sausage like a knife through butter) or the tropical aromas of a malagousia (whose medium tartness doesn’t obliterate the subtleties of raw tuna). the bartender will also offer pre-purchase tastes by default, a courtesy i didn’t encounter upstairs. there’s a certain irony about the whole setup: the wine bar can offer the type of service and wine selections one might expect from a fancy chef’s counter tasting, while the massive 240-seat dining room, where dinner for two can easily run $500 or more, is more akin to an economy class experience. that’s the milos money machine. if you’re a millionaire many times over, and you know precisely what to order, upstairs can be a party. otherwise, the right move is to hang out down here. here are a few notes on the menu:spanakopita: the classic greek pie, a blend of spinach, feta, and phyllo. the component flavors are stellar; the greens and feta express a vibrant sourness. but the pastry is stale.madagascar prawns: the $16 single-shrimp version of the larger $39 starter upstairs. the prawn oozes dark, heady juices when the head is removed. suck out what you can and use soft pita to mop up whatever’s on the plate. the crustacean is cooked masterfully; the salty flesh packs a welcome chew and a midlevel maritime tang.bigeye tuna: a fat slice of raw tuna on a cracker. the product is unnervingly cold, but the fault feels less egregious at $10, versus the nearly $40 option upstairs. the condiments are louder and brighter here too, with an uppercut of dill and yuzu kosho making a higher-volume, more palate-whetting amuse.scallop skewers: just three mollusks on a stick. here, they’re barely cooked through, exhibiting a precarious balance of scallop sweetness, griddle sting, and maritime brine. keftedes: veal meatballs, plain and simple. the wine bar serves them at room temp, letting the piquant, perfumey dill minced into the meat to express itself with aplomb. these aren’t ultra-juicy balls — they’re easygoing, chewy, fragrant snacks. consume with beer.\\tloukaniko: just a big griddled greek sausage. it’s everything one might expect, a chubby link that’s crisp and snappy on the outside and juicy and herby within.gyro: at $8, it’s not too much spendier than the streetside version. it was a whisper dry on a recent visit, but that didn’t detract from its overall complexity, porky crispness contrasted against slippery tomato and rich yogurt. add a hint of hot sauce and you have one of the city’s better gyros.cost: small plates at $16 or under, with many dishes at $10 or less.sample dishes: taramasalata, big-eye tuna with yuzu kosho, giant madagascar prawns, keftedakia (greek meatballs), loukaniko sausage, octopus, pork gyro, greek yogurt with honey.bonus tip: the deepest and most interesting wines-by-the-glass selection in all of hudson yards. expect about 80 different pours, with most available for less than $15.inventive, pan-regional cooking heralds a new kind of new york chinese restaurant on the upper west sidein the final decades of the 20th century, the upper west side became a hotbed of sichuan cuisine. chains like empire szechuan concentrated there, and one of our earliest sichuan chefs, wei kai chang, established himself at a restaurant simply called szechuan. so it’s not too much of a stretch that this neighborhood flourishes again as a bastion of regional chinese cooking. part of the reason is the proximity of columbia university, where asia-born students and faculty crave restaurants that provide a better taste of back home.the latest newcomer, atlas kitchen — whose website boasts “located next to columbia university” — indeed excels at not just one regional style of chinese cooking, but several. pack your bags, because we’re going on a culinary tour of china.chef kaiyuan li is a hunan native and a 20-year veteran of the new york dining scene, previously working at hunan manor. dishes from that province — where sour and spicy flavors and dried, smoked, and pickled ingredients are prized — have a major presence on the menu. sichuan food is also a frequent menu inspiration at atlas kitchen, with some dishes miraculously transformed.chef kaiyuan li and owners haocheng sun and dong chen (left to right)that old chestnut chongqing chicken — you know, the ubiquitous heap of dried red chiles and bony chicken morsels — is here improved with garlic slices, extra oil, a crispness to the chicken tidbits, and tiny twists of dough called ma hwa, which are being seen in northern chinese restaurants in flushing. and cantonese, shanghainese, and chinese-american food also appears. but li does not always stick to tradition here, often innovating on classics of the genre.situated near the corner of 109th street and broadway, the restaurant has a boxy modern premises, with murals wrapping around two walls created by famed artist qiu anxiong, who was born in chengdu. the mural is a continuation of his video animation series “new classics of mountains and seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by. the art creates a calmness in the restaurant, which mounts a menu that flies to the four corners of china for its inspiration. many say that hunan food is hotter than sichuan, but that’s not the case at atlas kitchen, though many dishes are righteously spicy. the red chiles printed in the margins of the menu are a relatively good indicator.front and center is one of the cuisine’s preeminent offerings, a humongous steamed fish head ($30.95) finished with red-hot oil, heaped with scallions and chopped chiles. the specimen is a buffalo carp, and more of the collar than usual is generously included, so diners don’t have to poke at the eyes and pull swatches of skin away from the cheeks to reveal some of the sweetest reservoirs of flesh. every morsel is delicious, and if your table is like mine, all that will be left is a heap of bones.but the best hunanese dish on the menu may be braised chicken wings, feet, and gizzards in vinegar sauce ($24.95), which rates two chiles on a menu that doesn’t confer three. it arrives in a wash of tart yellowish broth made of preserved green pepper, with, on the occasion i tried it, a chicken talon sticking out of the broth and pointing accusatorially. the chicken parts are accompanied by various vegetables. what a lovely sight! other don’t-miss hunan dishes include beef jerky, dry as driftwood yet spectacular in its addictive properties, and spicy dried tofu ($10.95), a pepper-flecked barrage of compressed tofu triangles that achieve the texture of twizzlers, served room temp.some of the options are li’s own creations, such as a plate of miniature tomatoes and blueberries dotted with dried sour plums, whose sharp, salty flavor provides a contrast to the fresher, sweeter components. his dish called beef flank in dry wok — cooked using a german stewing technique, based on his experience in that country —  is anything but dry. the small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus. one invention that doesn’t work is braised fish with perilla ($28.95). the leaves, which belong to the same family as japanese shiso, have been cooked to flavorlessness without adding much to the fish.on the sichuan side of the menu, successes include pig trotters with the meat removed from the bone and finely diced, then stir-fried with fresh green chiles. their wonderful gluey quality remains. among dishes from shanghai and vicinity is “minced beef with cilantro and egg white soup,” which represents the restaurant’s take on west lake beef soup. the shanghai soup dumplings are good here, too, thin-skinned and bulging with broth, though smaller than average ($10.95 with crab, $8.95 without).one of my favorite things on the menu is a fancified version of a classic chinese egg custard: steamed eggs with seafood ($15.95) treats a soft omelet as a seabed below an ocean of reddish, soy-based sauce in which sea creatures lurk, including squid, shrimp, white fish, and fake-crab surimi. eat it by scooping up egg, sauce, and sea denizen from the bottom with the big spoon, then plop it on your plate on a hillock of rice.on the other hand, you might want to avoid ordering rice entirely, since the menu includes two great forms of fried rice. the one called yan chow is a zippy take on a southern chinese classic, rife with eggs and spam. a hunan fried rice is also available, shot with long beans, char siu, and fresh red bird chiles. one of the most intriguing regional dishes comes from dongbei in the far northeast, where sweet and sour was supposedly invented. fried pork in scoop ($16.95) is a ball of pork fried with a very thick and unabashedly sweet crust. while perhaps reviling its sweetness, you’ll adore every bite.atlas kitchen heralds a new type of chinese restaurant in the city, one with a seasoned chef willing to take risks, while selecting favorite dishes from all over china. heck, there’s even a page called american style, which includes such classics as beef with broccoli and kung pao chicken. it serves to restore chinese-american food to its rightful honored place among chinese cuisines.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, two main dishes, fried rice, a shared dessert, and pot of tea, including tax but not tip, $95.sample dishes: potherb mustard bowl, steamed fish head, hunan fried rice, fried pork in scoop.what to drink: this place is not fooling around when it comes to tea, and distinguished tea is not cheap. small pots of tea served in ornate pots average $10, but in the chinese tradition, water is added continuously to the pot, so the tea becomes weaker as the meal progresses.bonus tip: put together as large a table of diners as you can, because choosing among the many beguiling dishes will be less difficult. in addition, large parties are allowed to sit in the raised rear room, which provides views of the entire restaurant.three stars for biryani darbar, which offers a stunning lineup of 15 biryanisno dish, except possibly the dosa, is as popular as biryani in jersey city’s india square — a two-block stretch of newark avenue that descends from kennedy boulevard to a tangle of highways on the edge of the meadowlands, and a three-block hop from the journal square path station.six restaurants in india square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. it’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to india with the muslim mughal empire in the 16th century. many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern india, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.my favorite place to score biryani in india square is currently biryani darbar. over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear. the menu offers a breathtaking 15 biryanis, but don’t prepare yourself for a visual extravaganza: if set side by side, they wouldn’t look all that different. i’ve tried 10, and all arrived in a deep, bone-colored bowl heaped with brown, white, and orange rice, surmounted by a boiled egg, cilantro, and a few rings of sweet purple onion. each vessel was voluminous, enough to satisfy two or three diners.don’t be fooled by the uniformity of appearance: the biryanis here taste distinct, though subtly so, presenting a swath of styles. the variations originate both in hyderabad and in nearby vijayawada, two cities where a tooth-and-nail competition over biryani has been raging.some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the hyderabadi style. the flagship of this fleet is hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern indian biryanis.other versions of the hyderabadi style deploy goat, mutton, ground mutton, shrimp, indo-chinese chile cauliflower, paneer given a smoky flavor by being pre-cooked in the tandoori oven, and boiled eggs. the egg version makes a particularly good brunch dish along with a cold beer on weekend afternoons, when biryani darbar’s dining room fills up with shoppers who have come from all over northern jersey to buy south asian groceries, sweets, and jewelry.the final three biryanis on a menu created by owners fahad kolani and john sehpur, plus chef ravi rajendran, are attributed to the vijayawada style, and you can tell the minute you look at them because the rice is darker and richer tasting. the one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern india. “but it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” kolani cautions. “it’s more of a green pickle gravy. it shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern india.”finally, when the version known as vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices. (kolani — a jersey guy who grew up with hyderabadi parents — explains that vijayawada biryani involves mixing pickled ingredients and pungent gravies into the rice at the last minute to make the flavor more intense.)that said, biryani darbar has a much more ambitious menu than just its eponymous dish. the bill of fare includes several indo-chinese recipes, a full selection of tandoori-baked meats, and northern mughal vegetable standards like saag paneer and aloo gobi, in addition to a slew of specifically hyderabadi specialties. street-food staple chicken majestic ($10.95) is one of those, coarsely shredded and breaded poultry in a lively yogurt sauce colored bright yellow by turmeric. it could become your favorite fried chicken.the menu is also loaded with vegetarian stuff, including gutti vankaya, baby eggplants with a stuffing of coconut, peanuts, tamarind, garlic, ginger, and assorted spices. the filling tends to escape and threatens to drown the eggplants. is this a defect? not really, because as with southern mexican moles, the sauce is the thing — the more the better. another intriguing vegetarian dish is methi malai muttar ($9.95), which finds peas dunked in a forest-green fenugreek sauce. if you’ve ever wondered what fenugreek tastes like, this is your best chance to find out.yes, biryani darbar is a great all-around indian restaurant, and a good place to discover some of the non-vegetarian south indian staples that are harder to find in the nyc area, like the aforementioned chicken majestic and the spectacularly sour gongura mutton curry. but your exploration should begin with one of the restaurant’s superb biryanis from hyderabad or vijayawada.cost: dinner for two, including one appetizer, one bread, and one biryani, plus tax but not tip, $50.sample dishes: goat paya (goat’s foot soup), chicken majestic, hyderabadi chicken dum biryani, gutti vankaya (stuffed eggplant).what to drink: buttermilk, masala soda, chai (sweet or unsweet), and mango and salt lassis are all offered, but i prefer good old jersey city tap water.bonus tip: don’t neglect the breads, from a fulsome roster that includes flaky lacha paratha, poultry-stuffed keema naan, and fruit-and-nut-studded kashmiri naan.david chang’s newest restaurant, under chef eunjo park, is a bright spot in the mall’s otherwise bleak dining landscapeany acolyte of gallic gastronomy knows that a fine way to celebrate the unctuous bliss of shellfish is to gel it. thomas keller devotes nearly 400 words to the complex technique in his seminal french laundry cookbook; the late joël robuchon, in turn, practically fueled a worldwide empire with his lobster gelee, setting it in clear jars as if it were a fabergé egg. any adherent of korean cuisine, however, knows that an easier but no less stunning way to achieve this effect is to throw a few raw crabs in soy sauce, let them marinate for a while, and then eat them raw. this is called ganjang-gejang, and to consume it means to experience the pure, unadulterated jelly of the sea.it’s not a dish that has achieved the ubiquity of uni or fluke ceviche. if you’re enjoying raw soy crab in the five boroughs, odds are you’re dining at a select group of rustic korean spots. the slithery meat hasn’t regularly found its way onto brasserie shellfish plateaus — or into the city’s thriving community of more creative korean hangouts. in fact, when south korean first lady kim jung-sook visited the big apple in 2017, she jetted over her own ganjang-gejang for a dinner in flushing, claiming, correctly, that its availability was limited in the u.s.enter eunjo park. the chef, who grew up in seoul, runs kawi, the most resolutely korean member of david chang’s internationalist momofuku empire. she is here to give us dry-aged steaks, pricey wagyu rice cakes, and a high-profile platform for that crab.she prepares the meat classically, letting female crabs soak in soy before chopping them into quarters. the flesh itself is translucent. it dissolves on the tongue like hot bone marrow — except the crustacean is cold, salty, and sweet, with a delicate tidal whiff. koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel. this all begs for crisp sheets of gim (dried seaweed), which are provided for making wraps. but really, the main event here is a singular one, and that is sucking out the meat from speckled oceanic appendages.the raw crab is above; below, eunjo park works the pass at kawimodern korean food is new york food — no less so than any pastrami hut, trattoria, sichuan spot, or south american food hall stall. the movement isn’t dependent on the momofuku brand for legitimacy; it’s already thriving across the city, at packed venues like haenyeo, cote, oiji, atomix, her name is han, soogil, hanjan, and too many others to list. but the addition of kawi to the ranks certainly doesn’t hurt. indeed, it’s heartwarming to see a superstar operator show up to a $25 billion complex that’s become a bastion of bland steakhouses and use it to represent dishes that are still largely underrepresented, or undervalued, throughout the country’s fine dining scene.take kimbap, maki-like rice-and-seaweed rolls that are more commonly found at asian takeout spots. park goes for a bit of elevation with these, stuffing them with buttery foie gras, torched short rib, and best of all, sweet omelet chunks and dried anchovy. on the side is a two-ounce tin of trout roe to amp up the umami. it’s not cheap at $50, but the mix of salt, sugars, and oceanic oils make it one of the city’s more affordably generous caviar services.new york does not suffer from a shortage of tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), but no one quite prepares a version of this delicacy like park. she pipes the tteok into a single pinwheel, pan-fries it in chile jam, and tops it off with benton’s smoky mountain ham. the net effect of this cross-cultural alchemy is a blood-red product sporting the dense chew of a firm steak, the fire of hot wings, and the complex, nutty porkiness of spanish iberico. even amid the city’s crowded korean scene, park, who’s worked at ko, per se, and the three-michelin-starred gaon in seoul, makes stunning fare that feels no less urgent.momofuku, born from an east village ramen shop in 2004, now boasts 11 restaurants on two coasts, with outposts in sydney and toronto to boot. expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen nobus across the world. chang has avoided this conundrum so far. as he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from paul carmichael’s caribbean-pacific tastings at seibo in sydney to max ng’s singaporean-accented dishes at ssäm bar.times critic pete wells touched on these themes in a fine essay from last year, but a significant question remained: would momofuku be able to keep up the creativity after taking on an infusion of funds from rse capital? apparently, yes. just as chang has lit gustatory fires in sleepy hotels and casinos, the two restaurants he’s opened in posh shopping centers this year — not exactly paragons of innovation — have been as interesting as anything from his early east village days. kawi has some of the strongest flavors and spice levels of any momofuku. park deploys a sweet pepper sofrito to tame the funk of tiny raw clams — but only barely. she sends out spicy tuna kimbap that packs a level of heat more characteristic of a competitive eating contest. but because this wouldn’t be a true chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. she tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. at the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top. the layering of crunch, sweetness, silkiness, and slipperiness, all in one bite, with a yuzu perfume to boot, is as good as any jean-georges vongerichten masterpiece. call it tofu brulee.the setting for these indulgences is nothing too spectacular, and that’s not a problem. chang has never been about vistas. kawi is simply a windowless room filled with dark woods, soft banquettes, and classic rock. there is no view of the vessel, thank goodness, only a view of what matters: the open kitchen, where park wields a blowtorch with aplomb.the fact that there hasn’t been much debate over kawi’s prices likely constitutes a minor victory, or a least a dose of hope for a pantheon of immigrant chefs who have struggled with the burden of being viewed as cheap. one of the longstanding riddles of the culinary world is that the chief difference between an order of dumplings and a plate of ravioli is 10 bucks.but things are changing. in an era when korean tasting menus can command $700 for two, it’s perhaps not surprising that rice cakes, which typically run $13 or so, can scratch at $40 after tax and tip here. tableside service is included. a server drops by to dip into your wagyu ragu with golden shears. he takes each tteok, as long as spaghetti, and snips it into bite-sized gnocchi. the creaminess of the cake achieves a symbiosis with the savory meat gravy. kawi makes its own rice cakes using an extruder; most restaurants buy theirs, and the result is a product that’s softer, lighter, and more tender than elsewhere. that process costs money, but in an exorbitant mall, it’s worth not overlooking value. inasmuch as chang complains about overpriced pasta, most italian spots are nice enough to do half portions for a lower prices. the giant wagyu ragu could, at $35, could easily be downsized. same goes for the cakes coated in parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites. even the chilled chickpea noodles are expensive by any standard; one dips the firm pasta into a cool pool of sesame sauce, making for an excellent spring tsukemen of sorts. this easygoing dish runs a steep $28.the real deal at kawi, however, however, is the chicken for four. park slowly roasts a breast, skins it, and lies it over rice noodles for a warm, comforting feast. in a separate bowl sit all sorts of wings, drumsticks, thighs, and errant pieces of skin. they’ve been fried, sans batter, for a pure chicken crunch. a generous sprinkle of togarashi adds just the right amount of salt and heat. at $67, the dish is easily chicken for two, with enough leftovers for days.there is no printed dessert menu the kitchen uses the power of sound to market its signature sweet. anyone who sits near the chef’s counter will hear the soft thumping of the bingsu machine, the korean term for kakigori. the pulsing is soothing and repetitive, not unlike windshield wipers. ice piles high in a wooden bowl, which a chef squirts with syrup and whipped cream. the flavors here are subtle and almost monochromatic. you dip your spoon into the volcano-shaped dome, retrieve a mass of snow, and let it dissolve on the tongue into pool of warming ginger. it’s tempting to wish kawi was literally anywhere else, but if it can act as a calling card for modern korean, a beacon for tourists who might not have otherwise engaged with it, this restaurant is arguably right where it should be.cost: about $100 per person or more. small plates — chicken wings, fried cod with yuzu — are $12 to $17; raw fish is $18 to $34; larger plates, including steaks, rice cakes, kimbap rolls, and stews, run $27 to $60.sample dishes: soft tofu with salmon roe, raw clams with sofrito and chile, raw marinated crab, wagyu ragu, chilled chickpea noodles, rice cakes with chile jam and benton’s smoky mountain ham, boiled whole chicken, bingsoo (korean shaved ice).\\xa0bonus tip: don’t sleep on lunch, the only time to sample the rice cakes with benton’s ham. a midday meal will give you enough time to hit up peach mart next door before it closes; try the black sesame and butter sandwiches, or stuff a collection of asian candies (including hi-chew) into a long takeaway tube.disclosure: david chang is producing shows for hulu in partnership with vox media studios, part of eater’s parent company, vox media. no eater staff member is involved in the production of those shows, and this does not impact coverage on eater.the second new york iteration of david chang’s flagship is the best addition to the time warner center in over a decadethe most exciting meal of julia child’s life, by her own account, was a 1948 lunch of dover sole meuniere. served at a small auberge in normandy, the fish came in a “sputtering” butter sauce, while the delicate flesh exhibited a “light but distinct taste of the ocean,” she wrote. nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of european and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era. wait captains normally debone the fish tableside, pair it with a restrained sauce, and sometimes toss in a few capers.the restaurants selling these skinless fillets — inevitably starchy institutions with continental overtones — will charge anywhere from $62 to $100. it is a very pretty dish. usually.one wonders what child would’ve thought of the version at david chang’s slyly thrilling momofuku noodle bar in midtown. alongside the porky ramen, chickpea soft serve, and frozen banana daiquiris, there is a dover sole that has evolved — or devolved — a touch more than others. it is neither delicate nor pretty. no tableside service here. patrons watch as cooks, under the aegis of chef tony kim, unceremoniously griddle the sole, pressing a weight against it for a hard sear. waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. the flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. it doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. it is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. the cost is just $43 here at the time warner center, home to the city’s densest collection of offensively priced restaurants. it’s as if chang is saying: “we can cook with the same obvious luxuries as our neighbors, do more with them, and charge less.” not bad for a chain restaurant on the third floor of a shopping mall. chang, who rose to celebrity status as an expletive-spewing chef bent on dressing down fine dining and subverting culinary traditions, is not an empire builder in the typical sense. he doesn’t xerox fine dining temples like the late joel robuchon or overpriced steakhouses a la wolfgang puck. almost all of his sit-down concepts are genuinely unique, from seiobo, a caribbean-australian tasting counter in sydney, to nishi, an asian-italian pasta place in new york, to majordomo, an haute-rustic hotspot in los angeles. but noodle bar — along with his fuku fast-food outlets — appears slated for interplanetary replication. chang runs three of them, in the east village, time warner, and toronto, or arguably four, as the las vegas momofuku borrows heavily from the chain’s repertoire of ramen, pork buns, and fried chicken. given how much culinary risk chang takes elsewhere — not to mention that fact that his venture capital backers will likely want a return on their investment — it would be understandable if noodle bar turned out to be the chef’s carbon-copy money maker. and yet that appears not to be the case, at least not here. caviar chicken buns at noodle barthis midtown momofuku has forged an identity of its own, embracing the sterile mall as much as its international eclecticism and somehow maintaining its soul throughout. across from a bose store, a j.crew, and a bland brasserie — a commercial cul-de-sac that’s barren after 8 p.m. — noodle bar teems with life. the long bar, cramped booths, and open kitchen evoke a packed 24-hour diner. patrons dunk squishy hot pocket-shaped buns into pools of jus; it is a french dip for the future, with the muscular beef concentrate magnifying the oomph of the soft brisket stuffing.an electric sign, equipped with flapping panels like the grand central train departures board, advertises nightly specials. if the buttery gulf shrimp over rice appear, order them; the viet-cajun dish, a hat tip to the houston upbringing of sous chef gary ly, bursts with old bay, cayenne, shallots, and cilantro. beef katsu, in turn, pays homage to nearby japanese izakayas. the kitchen coats a rib in panko and deep-fries it, imparting the tender, musky meat with a distinct crunch. just when things get too rich, an agrodolce steak sauce slices through all the bovine fats with the aplomb of a-1. and next door at lunchtime, cooks shave gochujang-laced pork into soft rounds of bang bread, a hat tip to midtown’s streetside pita vendors.these creations, while not chang’s per se, are still classically changian, which is to say globally curious yet laced with strong american and asian leanings. a few of the specials, however, seem designed as affordable odes to the luxe mall itself, a bastion of oligarch-ian indulgences. thomas keller’s per se charges $125 for its black truffle tagliatelle. noodle bar, by contrast, is planning to offer a spectacularly earthy tartufo nero ramen, likely for about $49.oodles of time warner spots levy $95-plus for caviar. noodle bar commands a more reasonable $28 for fried chicken buns, where the crispy meat gets a saline kick from a generous shower of smoked trout roe — a break from noodle bar’s $500 version of this dish that has heaps of black caviar. no, it’s not the same thing, but since many can only afford one of the above, the adaptation is an important one.and while masa upstairs is famous for its $68 white truffle ice cream (that comes on top of a $595 menu), noodle bar charges just $29 for something quite similar. kim shaves a flurry of the fragrant tubers over hozon soft serve, a soy-free analogue to miso. the flavor is pungent at first, then salty, then sweet. it is, like so many other dishes here, an axiomatic argument against the exclusionary pricing that pervades so much of this shopping center.folks might also try the ramen here, even if it’s not always on par with that of competing venues in nearby hell’s kitchen. a longtime quirk of noodle bar is that the composed plates have often outperformed the titular speciality. and just as dover sole is not replicated in its usual form here, momofuku’s cadre of chefs shy away from classic ramen nomenclature and flavor profiles, mixing shio with shoyu and throwing in, as kim tells me, some korean sensibilities with a little extra chile.the majestic smoked pork ramen — identical to the east village original — tastes like what would happen if a cook accidentally left a bowl of spicy swine broth next to a barbecue pit. it doesn’t have the same mouthfeel as a richer paitan, but the sensation is akin to slurping up al dente noodles slicked with liquid bacon.garlic chicken ramen, in turn, conveys salty warmth, with cubes of rotisserie thigh packing a lot more flavor than the neutral, egg-enriched broth. it’s fine, which is more than what one could say about thin beef soup (a skip). until the black truffle ramen arrives, the bacon-y smoked pork ramen is the move, as is a pile of chile-laced cold noodles. for dessert, diners can order that white truffle soft serve, or go for the frozen dairy alone. the kitchen also runs a special of pork fat-griddled bang flatbread, sprinkling the pita-like rounds with a coarse cinnamon-sugar blend. the end product, which looks like a floppy frisbee, recalls a smokier version of those doughy auntie anne’s dessert pretzels that humans rely on to keep blood insulin levels up during marathon mall sessions. therein lies the brilliance of noodle bar. even though it manages to be a unique chang-brand restaurant — and a venue that self-knowingly chuckles at the surrounding haughtiness — it still has fun riffing on the fact that it’s just a place to eat while shopping.cost: steamed buns at $8 to $13; small plates at $10 to $23; and noodles at $16 to$19. oxtail with rice cakes is $32; whole dover sole is $43. sample dishes: beef dip buns, fried blue prawns with sichuan spices, smoked pork ramen, chilled spicy noodles, beef katsu special, chickpea hozon soft serve, cinnamon- and sugar-coated bang bread.bonus tip: don’t sleep on the large-format oxtail with rice cakes and buttered rice; the rich, meaty, gravy-slicked stew is a solid way for a party of two or three to fill up without breaking the bank.sign up for our newsletter.chef stefano secchi’s pasta tasting has the ingenuity of a great omakase and the soul of italy’s emilia-romagna regionto fully appreciate the $90 tasting menu at rezdôra, an ode to emilia-romagna via gramercy park, it pays to understand a thing or two about pacing and progression in high-wire gastronomy. at a proper fine dining establishment, the kitchen never sends out a fat slice of wagyu or butter-poached lobster as a first course, nor does a tasting of yakitori or korean barbecue typically begin with the namesake items. a chef likes to whet the palate with a starter or two before moving onto more substantial fare, as a series of energizing coming attractions precedes a good action flick at the movies.but at rezdôra, things are more direct. the tasting is just pasta. that means no fanciful appetizers, intermezzos, or, as is the case at babbo, passionfruit dessert spaghetti. the night begins with noodles and, unless you order a lousy gelato or olive oil cake, the evening ends with noodles.mortadella-stuffed tortellini, each no bigger than a wedding ring, float about in a cloudy broth of capon (a castrated male chicken). the saline and sausage notes spark one’s appetite. that’s followed by maccheroni con pomodoro, wherein a bit of parmesan imparts a zippy tomato sauce with a round, msg-like savoriness. the feast crescendos with a fistful of ethereal tagliolini al ragu — more on that in a bit — and then finishes with anolini, little ham-stuffed ravioli covered in parmesan fondue. a server drizzles 25-year balsamic all over them, a dark, agrodolce counterpart to the stark white sauce. it’s not quite dessert, but it’s enough of a cheese course to serve as the meal’s logical coda.a pasta tasting, at its worst, is a gut bomb of a meal, but here at rezdôra, the format recalls the lightness and ingenuity of a sushi omakase. that is to say: each course is just a few bites, with subtle variations in richness, umami, and acidity expressing themselves within the confines of a form that might otherwise seem repetitive to a casual observer. chef stefano secchi’s ability to make this feel like a complete meal, with all its fluctuations, suggests he’s only beginning to show off his true potential.rezdôra, which also offers a la carte selections under $30, marks a vital moment in the state of new york italian dining. it represents a rare high-profile big apple restaurant led by a noted alum from osteria francescana. that three-michelin-starred temple in modena, led by the charismatic massimo bottura, is famous for its avant-garde approach to the foods of emilia-romagna. think: a lemon tart that recalls a jackson pollock painting, or a dish called “eel swimming up the poe river,” which bottura claims is “both recipe and fable.”alas, the only real resemblance rezdôra bears to francescana are the whimsical names of certain dishes. there’s “cow grazing in emilia” for a simple course of creekstone beef. the cut sports a straightforward bovine punch and a neat little herb salad. “grandma walking through forest,” in turn, is the long-winded moniker for green cappelletti. the noodles, which look like the cute conical hats that robin hood wore in the 1973 disney cartoon, are topped with verdant spring peas, stuffed with sweet ricotta, and placed atop an earthy mash of black fungi. this is your salad course.if francescana is all about modernism, rezdôra leans more smartly classical. this jibes with new york’s larger gastronomic pulse, which tends to favor technique, regionalism, culinary straightforwardness, and sleepy steakhouses over chemistry-like wizardry. but neither that reality nor the generic design of the dining room — plank floors, exposed brick, cramped two-tops, a white marble bar — detracts from the precise rustic cooking that occurs here every night.when one thinks of emilia-romagna, a northern italian region that lies between the po river and the apennine mountains, staples like parmesan, prosciutto di parma, mortadella, truffles, and ragu bolognese come to mind. rezdôra delivers on all these fronts — and with more refinement than at, say, michael white’s osteria morini, which pledges allegiance to the same region.clockwise, from upper left: stracciatella with vignola cherries, sirloin with herb salad, gnocco fritto and cured meats, and cappelleti with spring peas and black mushroom pureea charcuterie board will deliver all of the above in one fell swoop, but the gnocco fritto is the smarter delivery mechanism for these delicacies. golden orbs of pita-like puffed bread sit below piles of salumi, their nuttiness heightened by the warmth of the boulangerie. emilia-romagna is also known for its insanely plump vignola cherries, which stecchi pairs with a sufficiently milky (and tiny) pile of stracciatella.one could go on about those dishes, or the softly braised rabbit, matched with glazed veal sweetbreads. really, though, the primary purpose of a trip to rezdôra is pasta. about four portions make a light meal for two. order any of them, from the spaghetti vongole, slicked in a clam sauce as concentrated as a quart of boiled ocean water, to the infrequently seen doppio tortelli. the latter holds salty prosciutto and oozy parmesan foam in two separate “tubes.” eating one, slicked in truffle butter, is like chomping on an italian riff on a soup dumpling; when bit, it squirts out warm sauce with abandon.now let’s talk about that ragu. though often considered a straightforward dish, ragu famously became an exercise in the avant-garde with bottura, who once asked “could a plate of tagliatelle [al ragu] be at the vanguard in the same way as an abstraction of parmigiano-reggiano?” his restaurant elevated the staple by cooking the meats — which include beef cheek and veal tail — sous-vide for 24 hours, and it became one of his best-known dishes. anyone who’s fallen in love with the cooking of bottura will want to know how rezdôra compares.secchi’s recipe is different. he simmers a blend of soffrito, pork shoulder, mortadella, ground pork, and salumi for eight hours with parmesan sachets. when a patron orders the tagliolini, the kitchen emulsifies it in just a hint of tomato sauce and extra-virgin olive oil. the cooking is finished in the sauce itself. the same could be said of any pasta, but what makes that technique so powerful here is the thinness of the tagliolini. al dente isn’t the point. these are softer and stretchier, closer to the texture of rice vermicelli. they’re designed to absorb that wonderful ragu. some nights the sauce is thicker and pinker; other evenings, the slurry is looser. but on each visit, the ragu — smooth and devoid of coarse chunks — exhibits nuclear-level meatiness. one doesn’t necessarily taste the flavors of the component salumi; the experience rather conveys an otherworldly level of carnivorous umami. it will make your gums tingle. however rustic its sheen, the dish is as worthy of worship as any of the painterly creations coming out of the kitchen at atomix.the same, alas, cannot be said of the sweets. gelati, from pistachio to stracciatella, sport a thin, almost icy texture and forgettable, saccharine flavors. in a city with so many good ice cream purveyors, secchi should just ditch his product, which wouldn’t pass muster at a 7-eleven. generically soft olive oil cake, about on par with something from entenmann’s, gets the job done with mediocrity, as does a passable tiramisu. this is a bad dessert program. better just to leave here dreaming of that ragu and relishing in the fact that despite the city’s ultra-crowded italian scene, rezdôra already ranks near the top.cost: starters at $19 or under; pastas at $19 to $24; mains at $28 to $31; tasting menu at $90. expect to spend about $100 per person or more after wine, tax, and tip.sample dishes: stracciatella with vignola cherries, gnocco fritto with assorted salumi, tortellini en brodo, anolini di parma, cappelleti verdi with roasted leek and black mushroom puree, spaghetti con vongole, egg raviolo with ricotta and black truffle, sirloin steak with herb salad.bonus tip: reservations can be tough to come by; consider booking a month out for any table before 10 p.m. walk-ins can also expect 90- to 120-minute quoted wait times as early as 5:15 p.m. try showing up later for a better shot at bar seats.new york’s luxury seafood market is more crowded than ever, but eric ripert and maguy le coze’s theater district icon remains essentialsalmon, in its common new york form, is decidedly unluxurious. diners more frequently encounter it as a salad protein than as an haute menu item. new york magazine’s adam platt once quoted a companion calling it the “cheerios of restaurant food,” before adding that it was “predictable” and “useless” to critics. in fact, the last time pete wells positively used the word salmon in one of his rare four-star reviews was in 2012, when he wrote up le bernardin, eric ripert and maguy le coze’s french seafood palace in the theater district. it was a brief mention. i will be less brief. to understand why le bernardin remains one of the city’s most thrilling and technically astute restaurants, a gem of a splurge that won’t drain the bank account as much as other fine dining institutions, do one thing: get the salmon. order it raw with moroccan seasonings. neat rectangles of fish sit on the plate like pats of creamsicle-colored butter. they melt on the tongue, releasing warming, musky notes of argan oil and cumin.order it seared, with a northern indian spice blend. slices of red-hued sea trout — part of the salmon family — nearly fall apart when prodded. they ooze fat, enrobing the mouth in a velvety slick. a dice of roasted tomatoes adds acidic relief, while coriander and garlic impart a sharp piquancy.order it in pot-au-feu. chefs place the fish in a shallow pool of water and warm it for just a few minutes, barely firming up the meat. tableside, a waiter surrounds it with a moat of veal and beef broth, then spoons black truffle butter over it. a whisper of well-done flesh acts as a counterpoint to the wobbly pink filet; its ample oils channel a mouthful of salmon roe. a dose of broth then brings a rush of meaty, earthy balance. here, the majestic fish is as luxurious as wagyu.clockwise, from top left: ran ortner’s “deep water no. 1” oil painting overlooks the dining room; executive chef eric gestel and chef eric ripert inspect winter truffles; a waiter sauces striped bass tartare; natural light floods the lounge before lunchit’s tempting to write “le bernardin has still got it,” but that’s what michelin declares, without much context, every autumn when it awards yet another set of three stars to the restaurant. the more complex reality is that new york seafood has evolved in the 33 years since maguy and her late brother, gilbert, relocated their parisian restaurant to new york. namely, there’s a heck of a lot more competition now. milos came along in 1997 with its jet set lavraki and yacht-friendly prices. marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. and in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination. scores of tiny bars, many of them in hip downtown locales, cater to a moneyed clientele seeking (endangered) bluefin in all its fatty forms. so really, how much culinary relevance can a times square-adjacent french spot flaunt as the new decade nears? a lot, as it turns out.le bernardin could keep up with any posh omakase joint on its salmon alone. the menu focuses on sustainably minded catches with a breathtaking band of textures and flavors. langoustines sport a mouthfeel that’s somewhere in between marrow and gelatin. hiramasa, or amberjack, bleeds luscious oils. and poached skate boasts the soft, ropy mouthfeel of cuban ropa vieja. ripert and eric gestel, a longtime lieutenant who recently ascended to the position of executive chef, have not served bluefin for over a decade.another plus is that the menus — $165 for four courses, $198 for a tasting, $228 for a longer meal — are more accessible than those of the city’s most vaunted sushi spots. the beverage program has a generous feel to it as well. wine director aldo sohm offers scores of glasses under $20, including a flinty skin contact grüner veltliner (sound the air raid alarms, there’s finally a natural wine at le bern), and a seven-pour pairing at just $95.the room, updated in 2012, still shimmers. a tempestuous painting of the ocean, deep green and bigger than my studio apartment, still lines the back wall. leather banquettes coddle patrons seemingly dressed for a black tie charity ball. patrons who only follow the (absurd) rule of “jackets required” will nonetheless find themselves wondering whether they should’ve donned a tux. a team of largely female sommeliers, an outlier in this male-dominant field, glide across the room with airy zalto stems and silver tastevins —  shallow cups used to check the color and clarity of wine.waiters rush to tables carrying pots of sauce. lots of sauce; up to 30 different ones on any given day. they aren’t so much a performative flourish as they are the cornerstone of any dish, conveying endless layers of aroma, acid, meatiness, and creaminess. the result is a visual style that can veer closer to “rustic shallow soup” than “built for instagram,” but none of that matters once you start eating. and slurping.any hot broth is the fine work of vincent robinson, a saucier who’s plied his craft for over thirty years here. saucing is a famously fickle aspect of gastronomy — these fragile potions can collapse if you look at them the wrong way — and yet robinson operates with the precision of a physicist working a particle collider.take that hiramasa again. it’s too rich by itself. gestel, riffing on a light japanese stew called nabe, adds tiny shrimp for sweetness and matsutake for a whiff of pine. then, a pool of lemongrass dashi amps up the entire thing — accentuating the seafaring flavor while toning down the oil.in a peekytoe crab dish, one must concentrate, almost pray, to sense the subtle coastal aromas. it needs help, just not a lot. so the kitchens adds a light shellfish sauce, with a hint of fragrant coconut curry that only seems to magically appear when you whisper the word fenugreek to yourself three times.ripert has long displayed a fascination with asia, but over the past decade le bernardin has espoused a nautical globalism rivaled only by the more casual saint julivert. in 2019, that translates as sharp, salmon-y hat tips to india and north africa. it also means a transatlantic take on the spanish speaking world. the cooks sear octopus to a bouncy crunch — nothing unexpected there. then the flavor station throws in a swatch of mole poblano, a few shoots of cilantro, and a pour of spanish chorizo sauce. the flavor is sweet, grassy, and nutty at first, before giving way to a deep smokiness. aldo then swings by with a half glass of navazos niepoort ($15), a non-fortified fino that cleanses the palate with a tongue-scrubbing yeastiness.decades before neighborhood brasseries were putting sea urchin on flatbread pizza, a young le bernardin offered it baked in the shell with its own juices. “it smacks of the sea,” craig claiborne wrote in 1986. thirty years later, le bernardin continues to embrace strong flavors, sometimes dipping into levels of heat, oil, and funk uncommonly seen in even new tasting menu spots.take the geoduck, a staple at cantonese seafood spots but rarely encountered at ritzy french hangouts. le bernardin slices the phallic shelled beast into paper-thin rounds. this past august, it arrived simply with a few slices of cucumber and jalapeño. the mollusk snapped with a scallop-like sweetness, before exuding a tang that recalled fresh clam washed in tidal foam. and then the chile kicked in, jolting the palate with a capsaicin kick that would be aggressive even by hot wing standards.toward the end of the meal, a server brings over the surf and turf of the century: a cube of wagyu and another of hawaiian walu. the steak expresses a level of beefiness that recalls a shake shack burger, while the texture mimics that of silken tofu. the walu, improbably firmer than its bovine counterpart, packs luscious oils and grill char; it is as delicious and complex as a slab of more regal tuna belly.if only the calamari had as much pep and zip. stuffed squid with romesco shows didn’t rise above the level of a similar, cheaper dish at a tapas bar. just the same: the caviar atop tuna carpaccio exhibits such a mild flavor one could eat it and not know it was caviar. that miss would likely feel tougher on the four-course menu, where it commands a $50 supplement. and while i’ve never had an a la carte dinner here that was anything less than outstanding, the laws of percentages dictate that the sting of a flop is felt more greatly over a shorter meal.keep in mind that le bernardin’s waiters can operate with a retro formality that doesn’t always keep pace with the modern food or uber-cool wine service. staffers might apply the honorifics “monsieur” and “madame” with such frequency — more so than anywhere i’ve dined in the francophone world — that you half expect a singing tea kettle and dancing candelabra to accompany the desserts. appropriately, those sweets are as playful as a cartoon.pastry chef thomas raquel, taking inspiration from the trompe l’oeil works of albert adria, will trick you into thinking there’s a real apple on your plate. there is not. instead, raquel surrounds a core of apple confit with brown butter mousse before hand painting and glazing the sphere to look like a tiny mcintosh. the feeling of cutting into fruit and finding cream is a dream that every child on earth should one day experience. as for the mignardises, the chocolate dome tastes like a junior mint and the pate de fruit packs so much tart passionfruit one wouldn’t be faulted for mistaking this as a sour patch kid. the lesson, of course, is that majestic dishes don’t have to be stereotypically fancy or mild to reach their apex. sometimes, you can get by with salmon.cost: dinner at $165 for four a la carte courses (three savory), $198 for a seven-course tasting ($293 with wine pairings), $228 for an eight-course tasting ($373 with pairings). there is also a $170 vegetarian tasting menu. lunch is three courses (two savory) for $93. diners in the lounge can order a $60 city harvest three-course menu.sample dishes: langoustine with seaweed matsutake salad and dashi; peekytoe crab cake with sweet curry sauce; faroe islands salmon with black truffle pot-au-feu; hiramasa with lemongrass-infused bouillon; octopus with chorizo and mole sauce; hawaiian walu with japanese wagyu; apple with brown butter mousse and armagnac sabayon.bonus tip: reservations can book up at least a month out, but the full dining room menus, including the tastings, are available to walk-ins at the bar and lounge.london-based group rhubarb’s new york city debut goes wrong at every turn with frankenstein fusionsomething unusual happened during a recent visit to wild ink, a restaurant whose lounge offers bucolic vistas of a louis vuitton store across the hallway. my server suggested a few dishes on the asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” it was a curious statement. i hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness. the waiter simply felt the need to warn me, preemptively, that a signature preparation was garbage.so i did what any other normal diner would’ve done. i ordered them.three little empanadas, filled with marinated beef, arrived minutes later. i winced as i took a bite. chefs infuse the meat with inhumane levels of sugar and salt; if the kitchen had any sense of balance, the meat might be accompanied by kimchi or lettuce wraps to keep the seasonings in check. instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. it turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. in place of classic bulgogi, diners are treated to a veritable frankenstein of a dish, an unholy triad recalling microwaveable hot pockets, airline korean food, and hospital-quality welsh rarebit. the bartender asked me how i liked them.consider this review to be more honest than whatever my reply actually was.wild ink is a wild trip of a restaurant. the 175-seat space is located on the fifth floor of hudson yards, a shiny new manhattan neighborhood that recalls the sterile dystopian metropolis of demolition man. the sound system blasts the type of mac miller remixes one might expect to hear at a times square h&m. cooks and waiters sauce dim sum themselves, as if they were omakase sushi chefs priming each morsel for perfection. the unfortunate result is that the dumplings turn to mush.sometimes hosts don’t greet you because they’re staring down at their phones. in fact, managers can be so unaware of things that one night, a touchscreen menu outside inadvertently displayed an unlocked version of the resy table-booking service, displaying the names of the guests and their phone numbers to anyone who clicked through. at least i got to search my pseudonyms!if there were anything to get truly excited about, it was that wild ink marked, for a brief time, the new york return of tien ho. when it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than ho, whom wild ink’s london-based parent company, rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. the chef helped bring david chang’s momofuku ssam bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing korean, french, american, and japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. he followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at ma peche and montmartre. and then he suddenly left the world of day-to-day cooking, taking corporate gigs at whole foods and morgans hotel group.the scene at wild ink, plus lamb momo and mapo tofu dumplingsat hudson yards, his official title was culinary director for rhubarb u.s., the local outfit of the british-based group famous for its insipid restaurants and catering venues. just as his old boss, chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. he had been working for “several months” with the wild ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, rhubarb and ho announced they were parting ways. it just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” ho said. the fact that wild ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef peter jin. the point of this sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. the wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.the mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. the same can be said about general tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the cantonese-american staple.there’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fusing diverse cuisines, experimenting with classics, or upscaling rustic preparations; ho was once a master of this. these techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. but the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. it’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or cheesecake factory.like, did jin really have to fry bulgogi and mapo into “this-won’t-stain-your-shirt” finger food? does a shumai dumpling really need so much bacon that you can’t taste the overcooked shrimp? does cold chinese celery need to be turned into yet another bland “add-seared-tuna” salad? is it not completely mental that this is the only restaurant serving chinese food in a brand-new neighborhood?perhaps most frightening of all is that wild ink appears as crowded — if not more so — than chang’s much better kawi on any given night, with revelers knocking back bland matcha vodka mules and munching on celeriac root skewers as undercooked as raw potatoes.if someone does drag you here, the beef tartare is simple and excellent, with cool chunks of beef lit ablaze with hot mustard. crab rangoon boasts a clear shellfish aroma and a remarkably light fry. yuzu risotto is a smart bet, too. it’s a simultaneous ode to japan and italy, with the citrus cranked up to levels so insane that one could sell this dish as a scented candle. and yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. it’s a loud, beautiful creation.and roast duck is passable enough, if you can make do with the dry confit leg and sinewy breast with under-rendered fat. that’s not quite a compliment, but the preparation is more forgivable than the scallops with dal. one could imagine a genius pairing here, with the kitchen juxtaposing the creamy, earthy lentils against sweet, caramelized scallops. alas, wild ink plates such gritty legumes that they inadvertently act as an ode to the sandiness of poorly cleaned shellfish. rice pudding, too, does little for the palate.the grains, hidden under slices of mango, have been cooked into mush and chilled into a flavorless chokehold. pineapple upside-down cake, in turn, is simply a fine, forgettable riff on the midcentury classic, with ginger ice cream tempering the fruit’s sugars.wild ink poses more questions than it answers: did ho simply not monitor jin closely enough? had he lost touch with the city’s changing culinary scene following his absence? did the rhubarb folks issue a cruel clubstaurant food mandate, arguing they’ll sell better with the mall crowd? will things be this mediocre when the next rhubarb spot opens at the hudson yard observatory? whatever the answers, let me end by paraphrasing the words of my honest bartender: i can’t recommend that you eat here.cost: smaller dishes at $8-$22; mains at $25 (yuzu risotto) to $38 (bavette steak). short rib at $80; peking duck at $85.sample dishes: crispy chickpea fritters, bulgogi beef puffs, lobster har gow, snow crab rangoon, mapo dumpling, spit-roasted celeriac, yuzu risotto, coconut rice pudding with mango.bonus tip: for those who find the vessel aesthetically pleasing, wild ink’s dining room tables offer some of the most direct views.\\xa0farida serves a collection of central asia’s top dishes, from a succulent chicken kebab to flaky pumpkin pastryfarida claims to be “the first and only central asian cuisine in the heart of manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. as long as two decades ago, kosher uzbek restaurants such as the legendary taam tov flourished in the diamond district, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. i’m not kidding! though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. much more recently, quick-service central asian places have popped up, such as kebab empire in hell’s kitchen, which calls itself uyghur cuisine. but what farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service central asian restaurants are in places like sheepshead bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping casios like palmyra, kaifuem, and the original nargis, which cater to central asian and russian customers and specialize in banquets.farida is named after owner farida gabbassova-ricciardelli, who runs the restaurant along with her husband, chef umitjon kamolov, nicknamed “john.” the place lies a few steps south of the port authority on ninth avenue, far from the mass of central asian restaurants in brooklyn. but the couple opted for the midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” gabbassova-ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.it resembles neither a nightclub nor a quick-service cafe, but looks like many of the other small ma-and-pa restaurants that populate ninth avenue’s restaurant row. the dining room is deep and narrow, with an alcove in front, and a counter in back that looks into the kitchen. murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. the servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.a central asian menu similar to others in town is offered, though not as complete as those of the brooklyn plov palaces. both kamolov and his co-chef, firdavs saidov, hail from samarkand — one of three most important silk road cities in uzbekistan — while the owner is from kazakhstan, but they try to have dishes from all over central asia.each part of uzbekistan has its distinctive version of plov, the rice pilaf with arabian roots. elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of samarkand.the fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: the same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.that brings us to the kebabs. here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for central asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout russia in the 19th century. like argentines and texans, central asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. get fries or naan bread on the side.the chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.but farida is hardly a health-food restaurant. take the tashkent salad ($15), named after another of uzbekistan’s glittering silk road cities and its capital. this decidedly ungreen salad features shredded daikon radish and shredded beef, with crisp fried onion on top, bound together in the russian style with thick mayo. want something healthy? check out the mellifluous-sounding achichuk, which is mainly tomatoes goosed with fresh dill and onions. the soups are also magnificent at farida, including a meal-sized lagman with plenty of handmade noodles something like udon. there are further high points. shot with chickpeas, the oxtail stew ($21) is a version of the samarkand wedding dish, but you don’t have to be betrothed to enjoy it.farida presents a “greatest hits” of central asian cuisine, with an emphasis on uzbekistan. the food is wholesome and freshly prepared by a chef and crew that display a real zeal for the cuisine. and aside from texas barbecues, it’s your best chance to get charcoal-grilled meats that taste powerfully of smoke in “the heart of manhattan,” just as the website says.cost: dinner for two, including two kebabs, a shared bowl of lagman, an order of pumpkin manti, and a pot of tea, plus tax but not tip, $55.sample dishes: lamb rib shashlyk, crispy chuchvara dumplings, pumpkin samsa, tashkent salad.what to drink: the traditional drink in central asia is a pot of tea, available here in green and black varieties, but russian beer and tarkhun, an amazing tarragon soda, are also available.bonus tip: if you feel overwhelmed by the quantity of meat at farida, consider ordering the massive pickle plate, which features tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower, and persian cukes in a light pickle. it provides enough vegetable matter for several diners.the riddler and air’s earn two stars apiece for their accessible bubbly selections and stellar foodmy general advice for caviar coincides with my maxim for top-shelf champagne: don’t order either at restaurants. the only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of dom perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. to truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. it needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. a sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like air’s by ariel arce or the riddler by jen pelka, two village wine bars that make caviar and champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.there’s something particularly fancy about dropping by air’s, located in a bustling macdougal street townhouse. green palm fronds rise up from the marble bar. red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. teal lights shine behind cases of wine. and diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. but here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. the beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. and just as cookies call for milk, caviar necessitates sparkling wine to gently scrub the palate of all the oceanic salts. air’s can help in this regard, offering six champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. at the riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. true, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.clockwise, from top left: ariel arce, owner of air’s; riddler chef nikole morsink, wine director jonathan adkisson, and owner jen pelka; platters of king crab and caviar at air’sas the new decade approaches, manhattan feels more and more like a museum gift shop of basic-level fanciness: money, finance bros, tetris-like skyscrapers on billionaires’ row, wagyu-laden steakhouses, and bluefin-hawking sushi dens. that’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.air’s and the riddler rank among those venues — sort of. the interventionist methods used to produce champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” but the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. arce and pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower champagnes or other progressive wines. what makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like krug and billecart-salmon to spendier bottle selections.despite their commonalities, these are two very different venues: the riddler, which debuted in san francisco, hawks airy zalto stems on its website, while air’s sells discount caviar on its site. composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at le bernardin make up the bulk of the riddler’s food menu, but air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. one of them is très bougie. the other one is less bougie. both are quite good.shortly after opening, air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. that translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “our goal is to expose as much champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” arce, a hell’s kitchen native, told eater a few years back. accordingly, a jacques lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “queen bae beyonce chardonnay,” per air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.like terroir in tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. it explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. air’s is correct here: the faint sweetness in the rose champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. and whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a j.l. vergnon murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. the pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. the eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from southern u.s. waters. the delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. clockwise, from top, all from the riddler: a shellfish platter with shrimp and hamachi; white truffle risotto with parmesan; and the dining room during service“we want to be a neighborhood spot that people can come to a couple times a week. that’s why we’re doing a burger,” riddler’s founder and owner jen pelka told eater ny this year, adding: “but we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” it’s possible, of course, that pelka has a silicon valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. my first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “ask a sommelier for a 100 club scorecard to track all of the bottles of champagne you try,” the document reads. “those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” that proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from starbucks to sweetgreen, has a rewards program. but since there’s just a single bottle of champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club. that all sounds about right for a dining room with a gold-leaf ceiling.the riddler, by any yardstick, is expensive. then again, the haute-sparkling-wine stratosphere operates by its own ridiculous value equations. at any ambitious american or gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of champagne for less than $30, so the fact that pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. among those fizzy wines is a gonet-medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit lacroix.with beverages like this, chef nikole morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single champagne. it’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. but morsink, formerly at the modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.take the king crab. so many restaurants fall back on serving the regal crustacean as is, in its own shell. morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. the result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.shrimp cocktail gets a salt-and-pepper treatment, leading to a pile of barely-cooked-through shellfish with a sharp, saline punch. roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, french. morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of noel bazin brut rose ($25). white truffle risotto, at $42, will count for some as an unaffordable extravagance. but in this realm of luxury dining, it’s a heck of a deal when versions of the dish can command $135 or more. each creamy grain snaps with an al dente bite, a whiff of brown butter, a punch of parmesan, and the ephemeral pungency of pricey fungi. caviar is reliable and not too spendy. the large-beaded kaluga variety ($78) sports a soft texture and mild seafaring flavor; discard the chips and creme fraiche, which overwhelm the delicate eggs. better is the faux dessert roe. pot de creme arrives in a round tin, affirming the venue’s nouveau-patrician leanings. crunchy chocolate balls and bitter caramel sit over a layer of salted and sour vanilla creme fraiche. the riddler is far from the first restaurant to serve pretend caviar, but it might rank among the most adept; the mix of crunch, saline punch, and astringent sugar makes the frequently leaden dessert feel light, complex, and whimsical. it costs just $11, which suggests bespoke desserts are undervalued with regard to widely available wines. no matter. it’s a modest price to pay to spend another 10 minutes or so on a chic corner of the west village, with giant windows overlooking a leaf-strewn bank street.cost: champagnes by the glass at $20 or under, with at least 50 bottles under $100. caviar is priced by the half ounce and starts at $25 for grinnell, going up to $55 for siberian.sample dishes: caviar sandwich, chilled king crab with brown butter, caviar service with chips, grilled cheese sandwich with mostarda and lemon honey, assorted charcuterie.bonus tip: service can be a bit scattered in the dining room during prime time. the best seats, accordingly, are at the bar, which is conveniently located away from the drafty doorway.cost: seven champagnes by the glass at $20 to $28, with a shorter selection of sparkling wines at $14 to $16. champagnes by the bottle, while fairly-priced, mostly run $100 or more, though there are a few pét-nats in the $70 to $85 range. appetizers are $16 to 21; larger plates are $16 to $42; caviar is $78.sample dishes: kaluga caviar, king crab with almonds, shrimp cocktail, white truffle risotto, halibut with chanterelles and green shiso, pot de creme with salted caramel and crispy chocolate.bonus tip: riddler can get quite busy during prime time; those seeking a table should book ahead via resy.japanese skewers with classically french sauces reign at maison yaki, chef greg baxtrom’s second restaurant in prospect heightsthe outdoor garden at maison yaki, a french-japanese mashup in prospect heights, smells of charred meat and fresh wood. servers ferry charcoal-grilled skewers slathered with sauces that bear names like maltaise and allemande, while the backyard deck radiates the pungency of sunbaked cedar. two humans in shorts play pétanque, an old provençal game similar to bocce. they take turns throwing steel balls, politely raking the gravel after each round, sometimes hitting the back wall where tiny strings of lights intertwine with creeping vines. and then, after a few minutes, a bearded host invites them back in for dinner.on this evening, maison yaki is only a slip’n’slide short of qualifying as summer camp. and yet, the backyard acts as one of the most civilized waiting rooms in new york. fans of olmsted, a garden-equipped sister spot across the street, know a thing or two about waits and reservations. maison yaki, a casual spot where literally every dish falls under $10, improbably boasts some of the same inconveniences as olmsted, giving away its best tables a month in advance; the only availability three saturdays from now is at 10:00 p.m. but the little secret is that the kitchen serves the full menu out back. waiters balance the crispy beef tongue katsu sandwiches on ledges, right by the two pétanque courts. as i wait for a friend one evening, i order a skewer of king trumpet mushrooms a la greque; the namesake lemon-wine sauce brightens up the meatiness of the fungi. at this point, the sky is starting to darken, and i’m cooling off with a fragrant yuzu gin & tonic. in this era where even an informal dinner can be planned with the precision of a google calendar invite, and secured with the threat of a resy-backed financial penalty ($25 per person here), it’s nice to simply walk into a joint and eat standing up while playing alcohol-fueled lawn games.a patron plays pétanque; a spread of disheschef greg baxtrom, late of stone barns, has himself another winner here in prospect heights. and the good news is that the wait to dine indoors is much shorter here than at olmsted, thanks to a 50/50 split between walk-ins and reservations. kitchen counter seats overlooking the smoldering charcoals, or bar stools underneath the mini-indoor mushroom farm, turn over reasonably quickly on weeknights. evenings here trend more affordable as well. draft cocktails, including wonderfully strong manhattans and martinis, cost $9. a full meal for one — two small plates, five skewers, two drinks, tax, and tip — will run about $80, versus $115 or so at olmsted. that’s not cheap anywhere, especially not in a neighborhood where the median household income hovers around $62,000 per year. but relatively speaking, the prices are reasonable enough for a style of cross-cultural dining that doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the city. maison yaki is a cross between a french bistro and a japanese yakitori spot, and most of the time, it’s a darn good one at that. for traditional rillettes — confit meat in a jar — a thick cap of white fat helps preserve the slow-cooked proteins. but in the fanciful world of maison yaki, a layer of wasabi-ginger foam, doing its best impression of lard, sits above a mound of shredded duck leg. the frothy tweak cuts through the poultry funk with finesse.the history of french-japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. joël robuchon’s chain of l’ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. and oodles of modern japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.but yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. their cuisines are more codified. that doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. a bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-english names. the same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.what’s particularly clever about maison yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and franco-style braised artichokes.chicken breast nuggets are typically paired with wasabi at yakitori spots. here, baxtrom douses the little bites, whose stunningly squishy interiors recall ripe grapes, in sauce allemande — essentially thanksgiving gravy.this isn’t contemporary globalism; this is classic fusion. almost every japanese-leaning dish has a striking french accent and vice versa. and the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. a korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an american steakhouse. a pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. and a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. the lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest gallic seafood soups.from top left: the dining room at maison yaki; chef greg baxtrom with shiso snails; scallop skewers with sauce maltaise; max katzenberg, co-owner and general managerthat’s not to say maison yaki couldn’t use a bit of work. the kitchen doesn’t always display the same technical prowess with japanese grilling as it does with french-style saucing. this is not unexpected for a young venue. cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. watching a senior yakitori chef (or uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. they tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.the binchotan station at yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. the sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. the squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss. well, except when the meat is overcooked.you’re invited to the eater young guns summitthen there are leeks. they’re seared past the point of no return, essentially vegetarian mush on a stick. what saves the preparation is a vichyssoise sauce (a blend of potato and more leeks), adding a hit of bright, creamy buzz to the soft allium.  skewered pork belly arrives hidden underneath a foamy dijonnaise, adding just enough tang to balance the richness of the swine. if only the swine exhibited the silky fats and crispy flesh that normally make pig belly so compelling. these are simply firm, hot cubes of meat. one might logically ask about all the offal that typically define the modern yakitori spot. for now, items like gizzards and hearts only appear as specials, which is too bad because those off-cuts and viscera provide something that yaki could do better with: texture. the variegated mouthfeels one experiences at venues like tori shin — thanks to snappy knee bones and rubber band-like arteries — help break up the fact that you’re essentially eating a whole lot of hot, fatty meat. baxtrom’s old-school saucery, which harkens back to the era of careme and escoffier, serves a similar purpose, which is to achieve a sense of balance. but still, it would be nice if more of the skewers exhibited more than the soft or faintly chewy textures that dominate a meal here. there are worse verdicts, of course, than chomping down on a pillowy duck meatball. the kitchen doesn’t lace it with tiny bits of bone, as is the norm; the fluffiness puts it closer to an italian meatball than a japanese one. you dip the succulent poultry into a ramekin of soy and what looks like yolk. turns out the egg is really an avant-garde sphere of fruit puree that pops with the poke of a chopstick. “duck a l’orange,” the menu says. very cool. equally cool is yaki’s rare textural masterpiece, two chicken wings on a skewer. the skin shatters like the top of a creme brulee, while the silky flesh underneath yields with more ease. this is the appropriate way to end a meal here. baxtrom didn’t initially employ a pastry chef at olmsted, an omission he managed to pull off thanks to a masterpiece of frozen yogurt. and while there’s now a chef dedicated to sweets, the team hasn’t yet found that killer finisher here at yaki, so for now you can skip the mealy japanese cheesecake or run-of-the-mill profiteroles. those who want to extend their stay can kick the dirt out in the backyard with a martini and a few steel balls.cost: all items are $10 or less. dinner for two should run about $150 after tax and tip.sample dishes: baguette with yuzukosho butter, chawanmushi with summer truffle and artichoke barigoule, escargot in shiso butter, beef tongue katsu sandwich, asparagus with béarnaise, lobster with sauce américaine, chicken breast and sauce allemande, duck a l’orange.bonus tip: even though the best tables book out far in advance, about half the restaurant is reserved for walk-ins. waits are more reasonable than at olmsted — and sometimes non-existent in the later or early hours —\\xa0but can hit 90 minutes at prime time.update: an earlier version of this review incorrectly stated that olmsted and maison yaki do not employ a pastry chef. they now do.dennis ngo’s creative melding of vietnamese flavors and modern nyc sensibilities, along with dishes rarely served in nyc, is rightly drawing crowdsone of new york’s most exciting new dishes originates from the street vendors of dalat and ho chi minh city. there, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. this bánh tráng nướng, or vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in orange county, california, home to one of the country’s biggest vietnamese populations. but it’s been largely unavailable in new york.that changed with di an di, a greenpoint vietnamese restaurant from texas-native dennis ngo. when it opened, ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. but the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of vietnam and its american diaspora, debuted something a bit different in december.ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. and then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. the crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. the clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. the chef says the flavor combinations are true to vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of northeasterners: a new haven-style bivalve pie. the menu lists it both as a vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants di an di as a modern vietnamese-american restaurant. and it’s an excellent one at that.long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist tu mo had a few smart words about vietnamese soup. “don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author andrea nguyen. mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist french rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.nearly a century later, vietnamese spots pepper the parisian landscape. and even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in new york, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. few would consider it humble — especially not at di an di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than gallic consommes.it would be just as absurd to call the restaurant humble. patrons of all stripes line up two hours for bánh xèo — a dosa-like turmeric crepe filled with a warming blend of shrimp, pork, and mung beans; the starchy mixture is bland at first, but a quick application of fish sauce brings the component ingredients to life. other diners might reserve weeks in advance to gnaw at wonderfully chewy fried pig tails, sticky with tart tamarind chile sauce. they cleanse their palates with icy vodka highballs, redolent of lemongrass and bergamot, while sitting near neon-green lights and hanging plants.the plant-filled bar room and dining room at di an dithese are the type of fervent crowds the late pastis might have commanded in its heyday, or that momofuku might attract now. whenever an old developer stuffs his luxe mall or waterfront development full of copycat euro spots, i think about packed venues like di an di, restaurants that will define the future of the city while corporate brasseries sit fallow.humble, in fact, is not a word that would apply at all to the big apple’s rapidly evolving southeast asian scene. new york’s largest flow of vietnamese immigrants came following the fall of saigon in 1975; many of them eventually settled in elmhurst and flushing, which along with chinatown still boasts one of the city’s most notable clusterings of phở and banh mi spots. but just as a new class of korean and chinese restaurants are popping up around the city, a younger group of vietnamese venues are making a name for themselves as well, pushing past tradition and the burden of being cheap.members of this crew include bunker, backed by a queens native who dishes up bacon banh mi sandwiches in bushwick; hanoi house, which sells uni pancakes in the east village; and madame vo bbq, whose new york- and mississippi-born chefs book up the house with $59 seven-course beef tastings. di an di’s operators are second generation; ngo and kim hoang were raised in houston, home to the country’s third-largest diaspora community, while tuan bui hails from northern virginia. accordingly, they reference foods both from their vietnamese travels and their american upbringings.that means diners can expect chicken over rice, a staple dish in houston, where it’s normally steamed hainanese style. di an di instead fries the birds, letting them crisp up without any batter. the soft meat and golden skin taste like a mathematically engineered bird: poultry to the power of 100. to amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of lone star vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare new york appearance here. strands of rice paper, as wide as tagliatelle and as thin as tissue, act as springboard for a tart jolt of pickled papaya and a salty crumble of beef jerky. it is a perfect cold noodle salad.lucky guests might also encounter a steamed, grilled, and deep-fried short rib. ngo says the “entire reasoning” for this special, which packs a powerfully earthy beefiness, was to show off an even more flavor-packed product: mắm nêm. he softens the blow of that famous elixir, forged from whole fermented anchovies, with pineapples, chile, and lime juice. patrons wrap the beef in the lettuce, then dunk it in the mắm nêm, which has a stunning umami-rich pungency that more or less makes it the durian of steak sauces. and of course there’s the spring roll, a dish so ingrained in stateside culture that one can find them, for better or for worse, on a cheesecake factory menu. at di an di, the flavors seem to sing more brightly than elsewhere. the tamale-sized rice wrapper folds around a fistful of mint and basil, while a pile of shrimp and squid mimic the flavor intensity of a langoustine. new york’s modern vietnamese menus are often quite focused in their soup offerings. hanoi house offers a riff on leaner northern phở — little more than broth, stretchy rice noodles, fish sauce, and filet mignon — while madame vo reps the lusher and more common version from the south, fragrant with cilantro and accompanied by a plate of basil, jalapenos, and sprouts. di an di, by contrast, acts as an outlier in selling both. cooks cover the hanoi phở in scallions, adding a touch of perfume to the intensely beefy broth. and they serve the sweeter southern version with a plate of basil and sprouts for tearing and infusing. giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.the kitchen also puts out an estimable phở ga (chicken), with a clean poultry tang and a resinous hit of rau ram, as well as a strikingly nuanced bún bò huế, a crimson-hued soup heady with beef, shrimp paste, sweet lemongrass, and bouncier, thicker, firmer noodles.best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. this ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes di an di a vietnamese analogue of sorts to ivan ramen, one of the few japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.ngo says he plans to tweak the di an di formula as it matures, perhaps introducing a late-night program — along the lines of ssäm bar in its 2006 days, where tien ho served some of the best vietnamese-american fare the city has ever seen. and he’d also like to revisit dessert, which was nixed after an early effort to keep the tables moving. in other words, the chef is ensuring di an di can do what virtually any modern american restaurant serving any type of food needs to do to remain relevant: adapt and evolve. cost:  snacks at $5; rolls, salads, and starters at $8-$16; and phở and other soups at $14-$16. larger share plates are priced a touch higher; fried chicken and rice runs $17; turmeric crepe with mung bean is $18.sample dishes: shrimp and squid spring rolls, bánh tráng trộn\\xa0(rice paper salad), crispy pig tails with tamarind chile, bánh tráng nướng\\xa0(vietnamese pizza with shrimp floss or clams), cơm gà\\xa0(chicken with rice), bánh xèo\\xa0(crispy turmeric crepe), assorted phở, bún bò huế (spicy beef lemongrass soup).bonus tip: the short-rib special often sells out early! also keep in mind that waits can often stretch well past an hour for walk-ins; consider using the “notification” function on resy for last-minute availability due to cancellations.california’s noble attempt at sustainable meat is poorly executed, with bland burgers and underseasoned steakin the west coast meat world, few names carry the import of belcampo. anya fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. she achieves such nobility through vertical integration; belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert temple grandin. according to a new yorker feature titled “can steak save the planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. the grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” the company even holds o magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. belcampo’s east coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into new york’s meat scene. it is not. the restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of hudson yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. the concept is admittedly a welcome one here in hudson yards, a development where a single ribeye can run over $100.belcampo is where you go when you don’t have a reservation elsewhere or when the family is with you. the dining room piece de resistance is a giant glowing sign above the bar that says “belcampo.” it is a very branded ambience.this does not seem like the belcampo jonathan gold once wrote about. the late, great, pulitzer prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. other west coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. there are no such wonders at the hudson yards belcampo. this is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. this is shopping food. the standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; i recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. the progressive farm-to-table ethos does not extend to the beverages. anyone pairing their beef with a nice red will encounter a fairly generic cabernet, pinot, or syrah. it will be served warm. you will not see the bottle, never mind get a pre-purchase taste. there are no funky orange whites to pair with any of the sustainable fare.still, there are some gems. when it opened, fernald said that she expected most of her customers to be people who live and work at hudson yards. if you’re one of those people — or if you’re someone who simply ends up at the mall without a reservation — here’s a rundown of what to order and what to avoid. tartare or carpaccio: these are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. the carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. the meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. as for the tartare, it’s better than thomas keller’s more luxe version at nearby tak room. neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. duck poutine: fries get slicked in beef gravy and topped with crispy bits of duck thigh here. the flavors seamlessly align with their component ingredients. the meat is gamey. the fries are crispy — until they turn gorgeously soggy near the bottom — and the gravy is umami-rich. the cheese curds are firm and clean, providing a respite from all the salty, nourishing goodness. chicken caldo: this is a nourishing and affordable soup. for $12, you get a giant bowl of poultry bone broth laced with lime and tinged with warming achiote. heady forkfuls of shredded thigh meat float alongside big slices of avocado.tallow fries: this $12 side comes fried in either duck fat or beef fat. neither, however, exhibit the multilayered flavor profile of a proper tallow fry. they’re just run-of-the-mill, above-average frites, crispy on the outside and fluffy within.merguez sausage: juicy and smoky, the sausage boasts a clean snap. a solid $8 side.lamb burger: this is the only good burger here ($16). the lean meat isn’t as rich or silky as the famed breslin version, but that also means it’s easier on the digestive system. each bite provides a medium punch of salt and funk, while alfalfa sprouts impart a touch of pleasant grassiness. just one problem: the cooks apply so much drippy aioli that the bun instantly turns to mush. satay chicken salad: this includes smoky grilled breast meat over a pile of lettuce varnished with sweet-sour dressing. push aside the mushy cherry tomatoes. this isn’t quite an ode to the aromatic skewers of indonesia, but for mall food,it gets the job done. regular fries: underseasoned and undercooked ($6). they’re a fine advertisement for the $12 tallow fries, which are really your only option here. tallow tenderloin: tenderloin prepared correctly can be a wonderful thing. but at belcampo, the butchers’ effort to age the cut in tallow is in vain: the filet ($56) channels its reputation as the bland chicken breast of the bovine world. the overcooked interior is barely salvaged by a sticky veal reduction sauce. charcoal-rubbed ribeye: imagine the flavor of a regular ribeye, but deprived of silky fats or deep flavor ($80). my meals here were possibly the first time i’ve ever experienced a steak that’s simultaneously medium rare and dessicated. the level of salt is so high that the steak tastes cured. the exterior cap, often the most flavorful and succulent part of the steak, has been  overcooked to the point of dracarys-style carbonization. double fast: this is the restaurant’s classic double burger ($12). the kitchen manages to incinerate the meat in such a way that it’s entirely gray and overcooked within. on one visit, the exterior was bereft of a salty char, while on another, there was excellent char, but still no salt or beefiness. the dominant flavor profile is mustard.dry-aged burgers: the 28-day patty is a thoroughly average entry into the crowded restaurant-burger field ($16). the underseasoned meat isn’t quite dry, but it isn’t juicy either. a mound of caramelized onions and white cheddar provide the bulk of the flavor, while the meat itself it little different from any generic diner burger. the 100-day burger ($28) boasts almost zero dry-aged flavor. it’s just a pile of tender meat on a bun, undercooked to the point of mimicking the texture of pate. if you’re going to spend this much on a burger, go to minetta tavern. cost: most starters, bowls, and soups at $18 or less. burgers at $12 (double patty), $16 (dry-aged beef or lamb), $28 (extra-aged). steaks start at $28 and go way up from there.sample dishes: beef tartare, beef carpaccio, belcampo charcuterie, duck confit poutine, all-day breakfast sandwich, achiote chicken soup, steak frites, assorted burgers, and a lamb shawarma salad called “the vessel.”bonus tip: the right order here is an order of duck poutine and beef tartare (or carpaccio). for a classic fast food burger, the better option is shack shack around the corner.the hudson yards midcentury chophouse’s most troubling addition to new york’s dining scene is the $100 entree for oneone of the strangest moments in late-night television came in 2004, when adam sandler asked conan o’brien whether he’d been to per se. the question made a certain degree of sense; sandler played a fine dining chef in spanglish. but still, celebrities appear on talk shows to seem relatable; they don’t go on about lamborghinis or private jets. and yet here was comedy’s t-shirt-and-jeans everyman talking about one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with o’brien admitting he’d been there too. sandler even mentioned the owner’s name, thomas keller, the american godfather of the $1,000 meal.no other culinary icon is more responsible for raising the bar on how much u.s. diners pay for a single dinner. other fancy venues had four stars, but in the mid-aughts, keller had the high-end zeitgeist. he enjoyed high-profile consultancies on that sandler flick and on ratatouille. one of his top waiters penned a celebrated memoir about the nightly wizardry at per se.the coverage and reviews helped normalize feasts that could last hours and cost as much as a bi-weekly paycheck. per se’s success — the times named it the city’s best restaurant, at least for a while — fueled a new class of extended-tasting-menu spots. journalist jodi kantor argued venues like per se contributed to spendier $40 mains across the country. when keller raises prices, others follow. this brings us to the case of tak room, keller’s new endeavor at hudson yards. most of its seats are filled on any given night. its celebrity clientele has been documented by the hollywood reporter. but while it nominally specializes in midcentury fare, the true signature dish is more troublesome, both the way it’s executed and the frequency with which it intrudes upon every meal. that dish is the $100 entree. a single dish for one.the $100 entree is not an outlier at tak room, a restaurant that largely mimics keller’s surf club in miami. more than half of the mains will effectively cost that much, after tax and tip. keller is getting us to spend more, again.take the ribeye. it isn’t dry-aged, a time-consuming method that may warrant a higher cost; none of the steaks are here. it doesn’t sport the spinalis muscle, arguably the most succulent part of the ribeye, which has been butchered off for no good reason. it doesn’t even exhibit a particularly notable juiciness or beefiness. a spokesperson for the restaurant said the snake river farms cut should rank from a 9 to 12 on the japanese scale of marbling, which is about one would expect from ultra-expensive wagyu. in reality, the fattiness and flesh recalled the depth of something from costco. it costs $106 after adding steak sauce.or contemplate the prime rib. “two can share it, but it’s meant for one,” a waiter tells me. it costs $110 (or $142 post-gratuities and the like). keller himself drops by to slice it, shearing off a slab that’s as thick as a lean paperback novel. he douses the mid-rare meat in enough jus to coat every inch of the meat and the plate’s inner rim.tax and 20 percent tip have been added.lamb chops + sauce: $106ribeye + sauce: $106 dover sole:  $110lobster thermidor: $110filet mignon + sauce: $119prime rib: $142short rib wellington: $178 (for two)snake river strip steak: $206it’s a very good prime rib. the flesh flaunts a clean, iron-y tang, while the exterior shows off a beefier, and salt-and-pepper, punch. the jus is just a bit richer than elsewhere; it ties everything together with a hint of msg-style oomph. but is it any better than the more complex roast at smith & wollensky, whose dry-aging imparts a nice roquefort zing? it is not. is the service better here? during a final visit, waiters poured free wine like it was tap water, and managers, captains, and staffers practically sent me off with full military honors. and yet during my prime rib night, i couldn’t get a martini until i was halfway done with my steak. no one stopped to say goodbye as we left, $500 poorer.it might sound a bit strange to be criticizing a la carte dining in this context. the keller devotee may even argue that the chef is offering a concession to new yorkers by opening a restaurant that’s cheaper than per se.except that dining at tak room hardly feels like a low-cost gift. the beauty of a longer tasting menu like per se’s is that it allows for safe experimentation and salutary failure. nine brilliant courses will outweigh four misses. with a shorter three-course meal, though, the chef has just one shot at that main course. and the pain of that single large dud is multiplied when the price is double what it should be, a scenario that occurs too often at tak. the $100 main that’s “just okay” functions less like a psychological barrier that diners need to overcome, and more like an income test: those who can’t afford it don’t belong.if pe se, in its heyday, felt like a smart cultural investment, along the lines of box seats at the opera or a limited-run play, tak room takes on a different air. it belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. harry cipriani is the classic example, while tak, alongside neighboring estiatorio milos, are the more modern ones. the a la carte format in this case lets the 1 percent flex their wealth — amid the company of their privileged brethren — without the burden of a four-hour meal or throngs of destination diners seeking culinary enlightenment. it’s just dinner.to be fair: no one expected tak to be a cheap hangout. everything about it is grand, or at least faux-grand: its views of the hudson (for a select few guests; some seats abut service stations), the sumptuous booths, the live piano player, the crudite amuses (food critics get osetra caviar), the semi-stale candied popcorn mignardises, the sheer expanse of the venue. one could literally fit a sushi bar in its foyer and a cruise ship waterslide on its carpeted staircase and it wouldn’t feel any less roomy. the environs are about right for lobster thermidor. the kitchen lightens up the heavy classic with a foam, gruyere-lace bisque, using it to surround a silky (albeit tiny) tail and two powerfully aromatic claws. it’s essentially a large appetizer — quite nice if you have $110 to spare.thermidor isn’t the only old-school dish that appears; there’s also sauce perigourdine, avocado louis, and celery hearts victor. tak room would be well served to offer descriptions, but the only preparation to receive any type of narrative explanation is the strip steak. the large menu blurb, which is more of a sales pitch, describes the japanese-angus hybrid as “the best of both worlds,” and as a meal “for two or for one.” it is among the first items a waiter might recommend. the sixteen-ounce entree costs $206 after tax, and tip. one wishes a steak so rich could come in a portion that’s a quarter of the size — and price. but the goal here is anchoring, ensuring that high-cost dishes make all the other items seem less preposterous by comparison. perhaps the $30 eggplant parm doesn’t seem like such a bad deal in this light. until you sample it. it’s effectively a bland mash of textureless nightshade in a tomb of mozz and sandy breadcrumbs.oxtail consomme ($32) is the smarter choice. the meat’s natural gelatins cause one’s lips to stick together, while the broth itself is pure black truffle intensity. dover sole also does what it should, acting as a soft, flaky conduit for capers and lemon. still, it is little different from any other sole preparation anywhere else in town.when one thinks of tak room, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with the grill in the old four seasons space, that atavistic temple to power. the midcentury-minded spot puts quite a few mains in the $100 club. but many of the entrees fall way below that mark. and the grill casts a wider net on the past, serving up stellar fare that simply isn’t available elsewhere, from amish ham steaks to pasta with duck organ juices.tak room’s interpretation of yesteryear is narrower and more subtle; it doesn’t feel that different from most contemporary bastions of beef. steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. tableside caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. it is cold lettuce with dressing. the $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. the texture is sludge.better is the wellington for two ($138), a wonderful riff of the classic, nixing bland tenderloin for a mid-rare short rib that’s almost impossibly heady. the beef needs the pastry crust, (spongy) mushroom duxelles, and truffle sauce to keep its powerful aromas in check. too bad a smaller, more affordable portion isn’t available for less. there’s something to be said for a whole fish spot saying, “this is how big our turbot is, we only have one left, and we charge by the pound.” steaks, however, are the product of in-house butchery. a restaurant that wants to charge less can simply use a knife.keller is making a choice. he’s making a choice to charge more, just as he’s made a choice to build his more affordable and creative full-service concepts elsewhere, concepts such as ad hoc and la calenda, a oaxacan spot in napa valley. it would be a shame if the takeaway for developers was that we need more restaurants like tak room, restaurants where the $100 entree is not just a viable but a desirable goal for more owners and operators to pursue. sure, it works here. it will likely work elsewhere; there are enough bankers to charge ridiculous prices. keller knows how to issue a premium on wealthy new yorkers for fancy food. now it’s time for him to show he can do something ambitious for the rest of us.cost: easily $200 per person or more for 3-4 courses. remember that most mains are a la carte, as is typical in most steakhouses. that means an $85 filet comes with neither sauces ($6-$12) nor sides ($14).sample dishes: shrimp cocktail, oysters rockefeller, double oxtail consomme, dover sole, lobster thermidor, prime rib, short rib wellington, lemon meringue (with sulfurous meringue), creamsicle bar.bonus tip: candied bacon is the side dish of choice. think of the salty-sweet, lacquered pork belly as a mini honey baked ham for $16. also: the bar and lounge area accommodates walk-ins, and the full menu is available there.the tiny cobble hill restaurant brings inventive cooking to an eclectic ocean haulbefore you scoff at the price of a gooseneck barnacle — the worm-shaped creature can fetch $100 per pound — understand that there is no such thing as a farm-raised species. the crustacean thrives on wave-battered rocks and cliffs. those who collect them, on the iberian or pacific coasts, are equal parts fishers, foragers, and climbers. their toolsets include wetsuits, harnesses, clamps, and when necessary, ropes for rappelling. to harvest a barnacle means to risk death. but to consume one, a possibility at the spectacular saint julivert fisherie in brooklyn, means to sample one of the world’s great delicacies. alex raij and eder montero are among a handful of new york chefs to serve the percebe, as it’s known in spanish. the stubby, ugly creatures serve as a stark visual contrast to the crab-stuffed avocados and other attractive small plates in which saint julivert specializes. the calcified head of a gooseneck evokes a malformed clam, while the brown thorax recalls a petrified lizard phallus. they are boiled in salt water and served as is. no sauce, no lemon. a waiter advises twisting off the leathery body, revealing a single longitudinal muscle. sometimes that muscle is pink. sometimes it’s tan or black. in neither case does it appear edible or delicious. rest assured, it is both. the texture mimics that of a razor clam. and the flavor might suggest a nantucket bay scallop in its sweet wintry prime. or it might, depending on the barnacle, convey its sugars in a more restrained fashion, like those of a maine lobster. still others recall the briny wallop of a crashing wave pulling you under. each bite is unique. what is inevitable, however, is that three minutes into eating, your hands will turn sticky with shellfish juice. such a pristine expression of the sea doesn’t come cheap; saint julivert asks $30 for about 20 thumb-sized goosenecks. but if a dozen oysters can run $50 elsewhere, or if a tin of caviar can command $100 anywhere in the city, it’s hard not to think of this rare barnacle for what it truly is: a value. and with this dish, it’s hard not to think of saint julivert, a single room of a restaurant on a quiet cobble hill street, as one of the city’s best places to eat fish.new york has many new seafood spots; few of them are accessible or interesting. contemporary operators have largely used the oceans of planet earth, the source of so much biodiversity and (occasionally) sustainable bounty, to fuel a spate of blandly expensive restaurants. these venues primarily exist within a tight band of european or japanese traditions; one thinks of the burgeoning sushi spots built for an army of finance and tech workers. or consider the (admittedly more global) pool with its $200-per-person dinner tabs. or how about the new milos opening in hudson yards? the website for that greek palace offers mediterranean yacht rentals.a touch of skepticism about saint julivert, in other words, is hard to avoid. and at first glance, nothing about the restaurant suggests it’s a boundary-pushing establishment. it sits amid a row of $5 million brownstones. inside, patrons in cable-knit sweaters and flannel vests sip at beet-juice cocktails. the whole tableau feels very j.crew, very suburban upper middle class, very basic.a perusal of the menu, however, reveals that any skepticism is misplaced. saint julivert succeeds more than any other venue in channeling the world’s oceans into a distinctly new york expression of maritime internationalism. the chile-flecked bill of fare boasts influences from peru, the caribbean, southeast asia, portugal, mexico, and china. almost every dish is under $20. and just about every trope of modern oceanic eating is absent. gone is the four-bite, $30 plate of deep-sea snapper sashimi. banished is the altitudinous shellfish tower, gleaming with chipped ice and chilled clams. and there is most certainly no caviar service.there aren’t even oysters on the half shell. instead, the kitchen fries the bivalves tempura style and stuffs them inside a beef tenderloin sandwich — a meaty, mineral surf-and-turf po’ boy. the chefs also place oysters, plumped under the broiler, atop layers of pig ear and kombu doused in crimson chile oil. the net effect is a kaleidoscopic terrine of swine and sea, with all squishy, umami-rich proteins yielding to a lingering pepper burn. few other ambitious seafood spots — the thrilling le sia notwithstanding — deploy the pain and tingle of heat with such confidence. tiny dried prawns, and a squeeze of lime, add a bit of funky zip to ramekin of spicy roasted peanuts. and posole warms the palate with arbol and guajillo chiles; barely cooked-through shrimp sit on top of the hominy soup, offering relief in the form of creamy sweetness.  raij and montero, for the most part, have never really operated by the standard restaurant-empire playbook. they rose to fame at el quinto pino, hawking sea-urchin sandwiches with korean mustard oil; at txikito, selling some of the city’s most exhilarating renditions of basque fare; and at la vara, which uses food to tell the story of spain’s historic sephardic and moorish traditions. then, next door to la vara, they opened up an all-day cafe called tekoa that didn’t exactly bring in the crowds. it closed this year and became saint julivert in september, and it’s been packed ever since. anyone who’s ever waited two hours for walk-in seats at la vara can take comfort in the fact that things move quicker here, with a long steel bar and a chef’s counter reserved for those without advance bookings. backless stools cut down on lingering.servers recommend six dishes for two tops or nine for parties of three. take their advice; most of the cold plates are modestly portioned. scallop tacos — three for $13 — are one- or two-bite affairs. raij and montero slick the shellfish with salsa macha, garnish it with pickled red onion, and lay it atop a shiso leaf. the resulting wrap expresses the component flavors and textures — acid, anise, grassy crispness, marshmallow softness, and complex nuttiness — with laser-like precision. fluke ceviche also gets the job done, letting the neutral flatfish act as a conduit for a wallop of lime, onion, and cilantro. and mussels en conserva juxtapose the concentrated punch of bivalve brine against the tang of pickled carrots and the perfume of fresh mint. really, order anything except for the turmeric-laced tuna bake, a mess of musky fish and bland tomato sauce. skate is the staple safe order, a well-executed slab of sherry-sauced wing. the true gem of the hot dishes is the jerk kanpachi collar, a bony, fatty, pick-apart-with-your-hands side of yellowtail. raij and montero blacken the exterior with a copious blend of thyme, chiles, and allspice, dampening the fish’s rampant oils with nuclear-powered aromas. it might not pack the intoxicating hardwood smoke of proper jerk, but the jamaican spices come through unabated. consider pairing the collar with sorullitos, puerto rican corn fritters shaped like cigars; they function as a silky, starchy antidote to the heady fish.desserts don’t necessarily wow at the same level; skip a stiff panna cotta in favor of cuban bread pudding with mezcal ice cream — a deconstructed riff of sorts on baba au rhum. but a near-perfect meal at saint julivert doesn’t require refined sugars. the savory fare already does enough to sate, to inspire, to disrupt high-end seafood’s spendy stranglehold on the city.cost: most dishes are under $20; about three savory plates per person make a meal. barnacles run $30. expect to spend about $100 per person after drink, tax, and tip. sample dishes: spicy peanuts with dried shrimp and lime, whipped mackerel with piri piri oil, boiled gooseneck barnacles, pig-ear terrine with broiled oysters, raw scallops with shiso and salsa macha, posole with shrimp and avocado, skate with sherry and dry chile, jerk kanpachi collar.bonus tip:  virtually all seats, whether reserved or for walk-ins, are backless stools. also consider calling ahead if you plan on dining as a walk-in to gauge the wait, though be warned that phone calls are not always answered. about one-third to half of the seats are reserved for walk-ins on any given night.the exclusive williamsburg restaurant is a rare miss by chef missy robbins\\xa0“even jennifer lawrence had to wait for a table at brooklyn hotspot lilia,” a new york post headline read this spring. one can relate. a new rite of passage for new york gourmands is approaching the host at the williamsburg destination and getting quoted a wait time that seems mathematically impossible. those who arrive just before 5 p.m. will encounter a line that stretches down the block. and those who check for online reservations will think they’ve happened upon the ticketing website for elton john’s goodbye tour — nothing available. the reason for such insanity is the cooking of missy robbins, a singular commodity in a city where italian food is nothing less than ubiquitous. no one else seems to lace their garlic bread with speckles of orange bottarga, or dust their mafaldini with coarse grinds of pink peppercorns. when pete wells came to review lilia in 2016, he awarded three stars and issued a specific bit of praise: ”pasta made by ms. robbins is a direct route to happiness,” the nyt critic wrote. demand quickly outstripped supply. a sequel was all but inevitable. and so in september robbins opened a second spot, misi, in the heart of the $3 billion domino sugar redevelopment. here the focus would be more streamlined. while the menu at lilia spans multiple categories, misi’s only starters are vegetables. the only desserts are gelati. and the only mains — beefy specials notwithstanding — are pastas, all made in a 325-square-foot, temperature- and humidity-controlled room. feel like swinging by? as i write this, the next available reservation is at 11:00 p.m. on a monday. one month from today. for counter seating. walk-ins who show up late might sit down immediately, while those who swing by at 5:30 p.m. on a saturday can wait 90 minutes or longer for bar seats. it’s all enough to make one assume that robbins has again given new york one of its best new italian restaurants. if only that were the case.misi, at the very least, is a scene. here’s bobby flay on a date. there’s action bronson, sporting his signature beard. golden helium balloons float about in the private room next door. four hosts greet patrons behind a low-rise table; it recalls the check-in counter at a chic charity event. the open kitchen shines just brightly enough to flatter patrons at the chef’s counter. the bartenders pour frothy bellinis that diners suck down in seconds. the servers whisk over uneven pastas. the prime window seats overlook the williamsburg bridge in all its nocturnal... wait, there’s an issue with the pastas?there is. the noodles range from serviceable — like a forgettable pappardelle with chickpeas — to nearly disastrous — an oppressively saline bowl of fish sauce-laced linguine. in fact, the pasta problems are distinct enough that they can stop a bona fide robbins aficionado mid-sentence. a few weeks ago my companion was monologuing about the genius of the chef and her roasted romanesco. robbins showers the toothsome florets with an electric blend of lemon juice, olive oil, and coriander, imparting the stubby brassica with a vibrancy that’s at once electric, luscious, and fragrant. then i watched my friend turn silent as he tried the carpaccio-like corzetti. handsome rounds of pasta sat underneath an insipid tomato sauce and a canopy of fresh basil; the herb obliterated whatever nuance there might’ve been in the first place.clockwise left: spinach ricotta tortelli, chef missy robbins, the bar and dining room at misithis is not the missy robbins we know, the mind behind one of the pastas of the decade: lilia’s agnolotti with sheep’s milk ricotta. she uses saffron-infused honey — a bit of sugar and perfume — to counteract the tartness and funk of the cheese. the interplay of flavors is almost scientific in its balance, and yet the pairing is as simple as a composed cheese plate. or consider her rigatoni al diavola, also at lilia. spicy tomato sauce is a common enough preparation, but it somehow tastes cleaner and more alive under robbins’s control. the san marzanos are brighter and more acidic than elsewhere, while the calabrian chiles exude a warming spiciness. it’s from these two dishes that one derives a certain tao of robbins. the chef tweaks classic preparations in such a way that they taste fresh and revelatory. and she concocts gently creative pastas that somehow feel intuitive and seamless within the multitudinous traditions of italian cooking. she’s neither an avowed regionalist, like the devoutly tuscan rita sodi, nor a more freeform experimentalist, like the chefs at don angie. at her best, robbins is a pasta pragmatist, drawing on countless styles and influences to make absolutely inimitable noodles. at misi, by contrast, the only consistently impressive thing about the pastas is their al dente firmness.robbins can do better. she concocts a briny (if thin) clam broth and pairs it with a pile of gently mealy malloreddus, a small sardinian gnocchi. the golden liquid doesn’t permeate the bland pasta, nor does the dish bring any of its promised saffron aroma. rigatoni, boasting a tomato sauce with 30 cloves of garlic, assaults the palate with salt and cheese. strangozzi, long, thick noodles, get tossed with a one-note pork ragu; the dish begs for a rounder flavor (and maybe just a touch of acid). and linguine with anchovy and colatura — an italian fish sauce — packs a level of salt that gives the brain a very distinct message: stop eating. which we did.and then there were the white truffles. the seasonal fungi, at their best, exhibit a pungent fragrance that lingers in the air on the palate for minutes. here, they’re shaved over an otherwise fine fettuccine with parmesan and buffalo butter. but the aroma is short and flat, like that of a designer imposter cologne instead of the real thing. at $91, it could put a novice off this luxury forever.the only pasta that shows any real sign of classic robbins brilliance are the occhi, little ravioli that the cooks stuff with sheep’s milk ricotta and drench in butter, bottarga, and lemon zest. not a single element falls out of balance; the warm dairy heats up the roe, releasing its perfume, while the aromatic citrus and puckery cheese keep the maritime tang in check. the smart strategy at misi is to order the occhi and stock up on another forte of robbins: vegetables. cooks roast eggplants until they exhibit the texture of pudding and drizzle the insides with crimson calabrian chile oil. you scoop out the smoky, spicy, fleshy insides with a spoon and eat this happy dish like a child devouring ice cream. the kitchen takes grilled bread the thickness of texas toast and pipes whipped ricotta on top. the cheese shimmers like marshmallow fluff. diners finish plating the crostini themselves, placing blistered and vinegared peppers on top. the result is pure cream, char, and crunch. if a porterhouse for two is offered, order it ($110). the meat veers away from the prevailing new york style of steak, an ode to aging and blue cheese funk. robbins instead opts for a more cheffed-up preparation, crusting the exterior in fennel pollen, charring it rare, and drizzling enough lemon juice over the cut to qualify it as a modern, high-acid dish. the flavors are simple and pure: concentrated beefiness followed by the mellow sweetness of singed anise.steak, of course, calls for ice cream. mint gelato manages to exhibit the assertive grassiness of the herb without any of the menthol-like sting. toasted almond, as tan as khakis, pushes the envelope on what a frozen dessert is; it mirrors the texture and richness of finely ground nut butter. and fior di latte does what that flavor does best: expresses the taste of fresh milk as cleanly as mozzarella.in this shiny slice of williamsburg, the gelati are a fine way to end what’s, unexpectedly, a perfect steakhouse meal of sides, martinis, wine, and, if it’s available, that porterhouse. but as a pasta spot that people wait a month to get into for an 11 p.m. reservation, it needs work. robbins, who helped make regulars out of the obamas during her days at spiaggia in chicago, is unquestionably one of the country’s great italian chefs. but for now, misi is just another exclusive restaurant in another exorbitant neighborhood.cost: vegetable starters under $20; pastas under $30; steak for two at $110 (as a special). gelati are $8 apiece. expect to spend about $100 per person or more.sample dishes: ricotta toast with marinated peppers; eggplant with calabrian chile oil; roasted romanesco; fettuccine with parmesan and buffalo butter; occhi with bottarga and lemon zest; rigatoni with 30-clove ragu; malloreddus with clams, sea beans, and saffron; porterhouse for two, assorted gelati.bonus tip: sometimes walk-ins are accommodated immediately. sometimes the wait can stretch past 90 minutes. and sometimes the hosts stop taking names by 8:30 p.m. no one picks up the phone to chat about wait times; an answering machine advises to email for immediate assistance. an email to that address was not returned during a recent dinner service.the airy, plant-strewn restaurant from an isa alum has excitement ingrained in the menuwe’re already familiar with the traditional greek method of preparing octopus, by whacking it against a rock to tenderize it before slowly simmering, resulting in gluey and chewy cephalopod. but pheasant has found another way. tentacles are braised for up to two hours and pan-roasted in olive oil, then deposited in a slurry of spicy liquid salami and the concentrated yogurt called labneh, providing a funky and sour contrast to the blandness of the creature, which develops a texture like red licorice laces. the effect of this $16 dish is to make octopus lovers very happy.pheasant, opened last november, is a bistro located in an obscure corner of williamsburg, on graham avenue beneath the roar of the bqe. this area remained an immigrant southern italian neighborhood for the longest time; indeed the premises of the restaurant was formerly graham avenue meats and deli, a shop with a devoted following for its chicken cutlet hero.now, no trace of the deli remains in the airy and informal dining room, the walls suspending mirrors and perforated fixtures that shoot out narrow beams of light, with pottery and potted plants strewn here and there. a white, l-shaped bar dominates the space and makes it a very friendly place to eat. the restaurant is descended from a catering company called little pheasant, run by cat alexander along with her husband and chef vincent fraissange, who was formerly executive chef at taavo somer’s experimental williamsburg restaurant isa.pheasant’s 16-item menu is one of those that doesn’t really distinguish between apps and mains, and some of the former can function as light meals, especially if you’re not too hungry. the bill of fare incorporates diverse and sometimes wild mediterranean elements into such bistro commonplaces as hanger steak, seasonal vegetables, roast chicken, a twisted burger, quirky salads, and “day boat” halibut.take a favorite seasonal vegetable — thick-stalked asparagus — perfect in its freshness and snap. you almost wouldn’t recognize it at pheasant. the rods have been lightly battered like tempura, flash fried so no limpness results, then scattered on the plate with puffy buttons of potato mousse and cooling slices of ham. ham? yes, and not prosciutto, either, but good old american smoked ham like your mom or dad might have put in your sandwich if you grew up in the midwest. the dish ($11) is summery dining perfection, and might be the best thing on the menu.is that menu overly creative? not for me. i enjoyed the fez salad; it douses greens and vegetables with a carrot-cumin vinaigrette. i also loved a red endive salad that added pecans and goat cheese to the crunchy lettuce, and swamped them in a sherry vinaigrette that was thicker and more opaque than its name suggests. it’s a dish that disappeared from the menu last week but will be back next year, when the seasons change again. that dish really just shows that you can’t go wrong picking vegetables as your meal at pheasant. this is especially true with the single vegetarian entrée ($18) — itself an inviolable trope of neighborhood bistro menus. here, it is based on boxcars of polenta that have been deep fried, resulting in audible crunch and a supremely corny flavor. you’ll be teasing them out from their forest of ‘shrooms as you sop up the ramp chimichurri with the focaccia ($6) you should have ordered at the commencement of the meal.as if to balance out the vegetarian entrée, a juicy hamburger is also available, but not just any hamburger. it comes with slices of kielbasa on top, maybe to remind you what lurks on the other side of the bqe.  (answer: polish greenpoint). and the burger isn’t the messiest thing on the menu: one upping buffalo, a plate of chicken wings comes so drenched in scarlet sauce that it will leave fingers, face, and shirtfront comically smeary. moist wipes are provided.as with many bistros of this sort, the larger dishes can seem a bit flat compared with the smaller ones. a nicely-browned half chicken comes on a bed of yellow rice with a dipping sauce and side salad. while perfectly satisfying and plenty of food at the price ($21), it doesn’t really light a fire under your tastebuds. similarly, a large plate of hanger steak cuts plenty of medium rare meat into big cubes, but leaves you wishing the steak had been left intact without the distraction of roasted turnips.but these are small quibbles on a menu whose excitement is deeply ingrained, one of those where the challenge is not finding something you want to eat, but in eliminating those dishes that don’t sound quite as good as others. ultimately, my only regret after several visits was that there’s no pheasant on the menu at pheasant.cost: dinner for two, including three smaller and one larger dish, and two cocktails or glasses of wine, plus tax but not tip, $90.sample dishes: yellowtail crudo with avocado puree (fish selection varies), fried polenta and mushroom ragout, grilled ground-lamb skewers, asparagus with ham and potato-leek soubisewhat to drink: beer, wine, and invented cocktails available, the latter strong and thus not a bad deal at $12. the wine list is particularly good for a neighborhood bistro, with a focus on orange wines and fizzy wines, including a lambrusco great for summer drinking, priced at $45.bonus tip: the most enjoyable seats are at the bar as the sun sets under the bqe, where you could enjoy a couple of smaller plates and a glass of wine as a delightful and thoroughly seasonal meal.the mexican spot in greenpoint is serving summery vibes and some of the finest barbacoa in the citywhen salazar debuted in 2016, it shook up the la dining scene. located near the los angeles river in a semi-industrial neighborhood known as frogtown, the restaurant combined mexican recipes and wood grilling in a way the city of angels hadn’t seen before. the menu evoked the cuisine of the sonoran desert, and salazar’s dining area was a dusty expanse of tree-shaded ground that rose up among the surrounding freeways. no better place to chill outdoors with a couple of charred carne asada tacos and a tumbler of cerveza.it was an experience worth having again, and one that i’ve sought at various new york restaurants in spite of certain climatological limitations. claro, though the owner never stepped foot in salazar, came close, showing that the gowanus canal and the los angeles river maybe aren’t all that different. a wood-fired hearth flickered in a backyard filled with tables beneath vine-covered trellises, while cicadas buzzed merrily in the background. but though it was outstanding, it still didn’t quite recapture my la experience.another promising contender was gitano, an open air pop-up on canal street that actually originated in tulum. there, though, the wood-fired bill of fare was half-hearted, and the atmosphere that of a battlefield combat hospital.all that brings us to oxomoco. named after the aztec goddess of the night, this restaurant recently planted itself deep in brooklyn’s greenpoint — not exactly frogtown, but close enough when the setting sun shoots directly up greenpoint avenue from the east river on a sweltering summer evening.there’s a spare front yard with umbrella-shaded tables that you wish had a tree or two, and a high ceilinged interior from which the vines called devil’s ivy hang down from the skylights. with its cream and beige color scheme, the room seems lavish despite its battered walls and general lack of decoration. the executive chef is justin bazdarich, who previously hatched the pizzeria speedy romeo. besides all the ways it resembles la’s salazar, the restaurant is yet another example of the accelerating appreciation of mexican food in new york — in part due to the taquerias and decades of immigrant participation in restaurant kitchens. now, the city has an increasing awareness of regional mexican cuisines and a willingness among diners to pay more for it, as with italian and japanese fare in the past.though some of the most notable restaurants serving ambitious, expensive versions of the cuisine are run by mexican chefs (cosme, casa enrique, atla), it’s a scene that’s also conspicuously filled with people who have come to enjoy the cuisine as outsiders — like bazdarich and his business partner chris walton, self-described “white kids from missouri.” claro and gitano are also examples, as is the empellon empire, where oxomoco’s chef de cuisine matt conroy once worked. here, bazdarich pulled from his memories of traveling to the country; he and conroy also brought on oaxacan-born chef kaelin ulrich, son of famed oaxacan chef and teacher susana trilling, to consult during the initial months of menu creation.despite the goofy unevenness of speedy romeo’s menu, bazdarich has really hit the culinary jackpot at oxomoco, where the tacos are every bit as good as the ones at salazar. best is barbacoa. at oxomoco, lamb that has been grilled over wood, slow-cooked, and then loaded into a coarse-textured corn tortilla that will remind you of los angeles’s. a relish made of pipicha — a feathery herb that tastes like dirty mint — crowns the jiggly meat, as does a squash blossom that doesn’t add much but sure looks pretty riding shotgun. sadly, the price of $16 for two tacos is exactly twice the cost at salazar.other oxomoco tacos worth tasting include pig cheek with green avocado salsa, flank steak with smoked eggplant relish and rubbery cotija cheese (now served with caramelized onions), and tempura-fried hake (now it’s shrimp), reminding us that the baja peninsula, the original home of the fish taco, is considered part of the sonoran desert. but a vegetarian taco of beets and potatoes intended to resemble chorizo is bland and boring.other antojitos, or corn-based staples, are worth ordering, on a menu twice as long as salazar’s. whatever you do, don’t miss the creamy charred-carrot tamales, which come pooled in a verdant sauce. the steak tartare tostada ($16), exceedingly fresh beef cut into a ragged dice, is preferable to a tuna tostada that makes too-lavish use of soy sauce, which clashes with the corn tortilla. in fact, i’d skip anything featuring raw fish at oxomoco, including the hamachi aguachile. what new york city really needs is a full-blown mexican cevicheria.instead, head for the salads, which are an unexpected delight. the heirloom tomato salad ($16) hoists little heaps of snowy queso fresco among its peaks; the dish is one of the most cooling things imaginable. a caesar salad made with grilled romaine is not the most original idea in the borough, but here, this commonplace dish has been turned into a top-notch treat, sodden with dressing and tasting almost as meaty as steak.in fact, the chefs have proven they will smoke almost anything, including fruits that go into the cocktails. that extends, of course, to the full-blown entrees, of which there are only three. all are shareable, and two are spectacular enough you should forego some of the tacos to get them. the whole branzino ($42) has been splayed, grilled, and brushed with a piquant green sauce based the fresh mexican herb hoja santa. it’s accompanied by oaxacan mole amarillo, which doesn’t belong with the fish, but makes a nice dip for tortillas.the best entree is a 32-ounce dry-aged ribeye, a massive hunk of meat at $99. and here we encroach further into salazar territory. take one bite of this juicy pink masterpiece, sliced thick, and you’ll feel like you’re dining in an isolated restaurant in la on a warm summer evening with the traffic streaming all around you. here, it’s greenpoint traffic.cost: dinner for two, including an heirloom tomato salad, two barbacoa tacos, a grilled branzino, and two cocktails, including tax but not tip, $115sample dishes: charred carrot tamal, pork cheek carnitas tacos, punta verde caesar salad, grilled branzinowhat to drink: the margaritas are particularly luscious, including one made with smoked peach and another featuring watermelon juice and hoja santa.bonus tip: the menu leads off with four snacks that are something of a bargain, including roasted red-skinned peanuts with garlic and chiles ($3), and dried and smoked mango ($4). both are good for filling up, on a menu that’s more expensive than it ought to be.creative comfort food, warm hospitality, and complimentary cheese balls delight at the prospect heights newcomermeme’s diner in prospect heights was empty at 10 p.m. on a recent thursday. i walked in, took a seat at the counter, and grinned as a waiter placed a saucer of cheeseballs in front of me. this was not an artisanal product but an industrial one — neon corn puffs enrobed in dehydrated cheddar. their bright orange hue took on the air of bioluminescence against the christmas-green bar stools. i ate the puffs in between sips of passion fruit-laced milk punch; when i finished them the waiter asked if i’d like more. this transaction occurred in less time than it typically takes to get $7 bread service at a more upscale establishment. the cheeseballs were free. there were three staffers in the restaurant that night: the waiter, co-owner bill clark, who worked the front of the house, and co-owner libby willis, who oversaw the kitchen alone. willis sent out my coconut-crusted sweet potato atop a pool of salsa verde and mole poblano, the sugary starch acting as a counterpoint to the tart, nutty, fiery sauces. i paired the dish with the restaurant’s signature manhattan, a cocktail that clark’s grandmother reportedly drinks every day. it was a big manhattan.amid the quiet room i wondered if i was inside a modern, boozy version of edward hopper’s nighthawks, the 1942 painting that depicted a sparsely populated greenwich village diner as a beacon on a dark city street. then other patrons started showing up, and i was no longer alone, though really, i never was. the fact that meme’s is a newly opened diner — not to mention a queer-owned business with a largely queer and diverse staff — makes it an outlier of sorts, even if the term “diner” is loosely applied. a diner, after all, is supposed to serve lunch and breakfast; meme’s does not. and a diner is supposed to be old, which doesn’t say much for the future of the form. a crain’s article from 2015 suggests the number of these establishments have dropped by nearly 60 percent over the past 25 years. the reasons are similar to why other small-time operators have been closing: the cost of business is going up as rents and labor costs continue to rise.this reality is even tougher for a diner. patrons expect longer hours, lower check averages, a patty melt that never changes, and epically lengthy menus, all in a venue where they can sit and read the newspaper for an hour and get free refills. and therein lies the paradox. everything that allows independent restaurants to adapt to the city’s brutal restaurant economy, from seasonal menu innovations, to performative sourcing (organic this, fair trade that) to never-ending price hikes, goes against the very nature of what a diner is supposed to be: a stable respite from our brutally mutating capitalist world. channeling the ethos of a diner, in other words, comes with handcuffs that are both financial and nostalgic. willis and clark succeed by playing by some of the rules; there are the lowish prices, the giant dinner portions. and then they bend some of the others, as with their freewheeling approach to comfort fare, which ranges from deliciously dorm room-y (potato chip-crusted mac and cheese with hot sauce) to healthfully voguish (quinoa, millet, and amaranth porridge). the setting, incidentally, is a 31-seat room boasting a teal-and-brown bar, a letterboard cocktail menu, bucket stools, frosted cake under a glass cloche, and tan leather benches. meme’s isn’t so much a utilitarian cafeteria as it is a rosy-eyed reanimation of a midcentury lunch counter. i can’t think of another restaurant with a shirley temple on the beverage list.this is precisely the place to order a patty melt. the burger, smashed between two slices of griddled marble rye, packs a deep maillard char, and drips with american cheese and russian dressing. on the side is a pile of potatoes as crispy and heady as anything out of a michelin-starred french brasserie. this costs just $17. affordability is key. one can enjoy a giant egg sandwich, stacked with cheese and greens, for just eight bucks. a more composed brunch or dinner, with a beer, tax, and tip, will run about $30. to be fair, those aren’t price levels that one might deem “diner cheap.” and accessibility isn’t the term that comes to mind when one hears of 90-minute waits during peak brunch.related: brunch is excellent. on a sunday afternoon the restaurant was filled with people wearing dresses, graphic t-shirts, babies, hijabs, designer trucker caps, and statement necklaces. there are no free cheeseballs at brunch. there are free bowls of dry cereal instead, a mix of lucky charms, froot loops, trix, and golden grahams. the cereal contains no milk or kitschy refinement, though it’s hard not to overlook the fact that the bespoke selection appears to have been coordinated with the restaurant’s own faded color scheme. the wait staff is happy to bring seconds. willis and clark base their approach to american comfort fare on a mix of “international pantry staples” (chile oil, fish sauce), “farmer’s market greens,” and “bodega standards,” to use their words. the cereal clearly belongs in the bodega camp. so do the migas — soft-scrambled eggs with cilantro served in a bag of fritos. as the chipotle cream and green salsa absorbs into the corn chips, they soften into a glorious, fork pierce-able mush. pair this with a few slices of maldon-flecked cinnamon toast.just as stunning — and photogenic — are the fried eggs, served sunny side up on a bed of wilted kale. willis surrounds them with a tidy moat of chile oil, the shallow pool filled with pepitas, sunflower seed, and poppy seeds. the flavor is gentle at first, complexly nutty, crunchy, and smoldering. and then pepper-laced greens assault the palate with a stinging uppercut of heat. in the evenings, the right way to kick off a meal is with the fried giardiniera, a fritto misto improved by the acidic tang of pickled carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers. griddled meatballs, in turn, are doused in an intoxicating char siu-style mix of cinnamon, garlic, and hoisin. you retrieve them out of a ceramic crock with wooden toothpicks.for mains, consider the patty melt or sweet potato. the suburban mall-style buffalo chicken salad is everything it claims to be, a bed of blue cheese-studded lettuce below a pile of crispy hot sauce-slicked fowl. the cordon bleu, in turn, is a study in satiating caloric expectations; it’s a thick slab of pan-fried breast meat in a robe of salty ham and gruyere.those who drop by a touch earlier or later will find patrons using meme’s like they would a traditional diner, which is to say at a more leisurely pace, with no waits at all. i watched as one guest sat and sketched in a notebook before sunset. another couple came in for dessert just before 11 p.m. their reward was a slice of vietnamese iced coffee cake, simultaneously sweet, bitter, and fluffy.servers present each check with a mint-chocolate andes candy. they say thank you, and that’s it. they don’t say “thanks guys” or “come back again, ladies.” it’s part of the gender-neutral ethos; common phrases like “yes sir” or “yes ma’am,” whose incorrect usage can ruin someone’s meal, are never uttered here.it’s no small matter that these policies are being implemented at a venue that serves as a proverbial third place between work and home. in an era when incidents at coffee chains, breakfast chains, late-night bars, and bakeries are making more americans question whether so-called everyday spaces are truly welcome to all, and in an era when queer spaces in the hospitality industry are gradually vanishing, society could use more places like meme’s — places where inclusivity and diversity aren’t a reactionary pr scheme, but rather part of the institution’s dna. the fact that it serves one of the city’s best brunches doesn’t hurt either; the opening of the back garden in warmer weather should help with the waits just a touch. and even though meme’s is a chic diner where the coffee costs $4, refills are still free.cost: starters at $10 or less; mains at $20 or less. desserts are $8. nothing is more than $17 at brunch. coffee is $4. the egg sandwich is $8 by itself, or $10 with bacon.sample dishes: fried giardiniera, barbecue meatballs, buffalo chicken salad, coconut-crusted sweet potato, patty melt, frito pie migas, chile oil fried egg, everything bagel babka, vietnamese iced coffee cake.the cheaper pies excel in simplicity, but everything else can be avoidedthe east village’s sorbillo is the first overseas branch of a well-regarded naples pizzeria, opened late last november on bowery. it’s helmed by gino sorbillo, as famous for his campaign against organized crime as for his pizza. he has gladly donned the mantle of celebrity chef and sashayed into the east village wearing it for a few days before departing and leaving his brother toto in charge. after a brief tenure and a few photo opps, toto left too.still, even after their departure, a reminder of sorbillo’s italian celebrity remains in the east village space. the expansive, well-lit interior has graphic texts in italian along the walls, including a stenciled slogan “la pizza fa miracoli” (or “pizza makes miracles”). near the rear of the room, portraits of a bespectacled sorbillo stare down from the walls like big brother. as for the supposedly celebrity-level pizzas, sure, you can get a great pie at sorbillo — but only if you stick to the cheaper ones. flying from the wood-burning beehive oven at the end of the room, the pizzas are of the classic naples variety. large enough to satisfy one person, they sport an airy, bulbous crust speckled with spots of char, and a fine texture that results from the imported flour used. the lower-cost pies revel in this simplicity, using mainly canned san marzano tomatoes, domestic and imported mozzarella, and a drizzle of flavorful olive oil. consistent with the genre, these pies are limp and damp in the middle, so you may have to pick up a knife and fork to eat them. pizzas like the antica margherita ($17) are spectacular in their nuanced blandness. (better not to think about the price of a similar pie in naples, which is often less than half.) the vecchia roma ($18), also worth the money, boasts shavings of uncured guanciale (hog jowl) in addition to rome’s signature cheese, pecorino, which gives the pie a salty savor. this is brilliant pizza formulation, on a menu that confers themes inspired by italian regions on most of its 15 pies. my favorite of all, nduja ($22) is associated with calabria, the toe of italy’s boot. across its surface lie little splotches of liquid salami, with rings of purple onion strewn around like hula hoops. the calzone’s worth ordering too, a neapolitan specialty that wraps the same dough around a filling of ricotta, mozzarella, and salami, propelled by black pepper, making a meal of incredible richness. but some of the more expensive pies are terrible. one evening, a friend and i tested pizzas topped with porcini mushrooms and black truffles (the firenze and the alba, respectively priced at $30 and $35). the mushrooms were sodden and slippery, and the truffles lumpy with no delicacy of flavor; both tasted canned. heck, if you have a fresh truffle, it’s not a bad idea to put it on a cheese pizza, but you must shave it on at the last minute.the three sorbillo branches in naples mainly offer pizzas with a handful of starters, but when the idea of a new york branch was being hatched, someone had the bright idea that the place should be a full-blown italian restaurant, too. this was a big mistake, leading the pizzas to almost seem like an afterthought on a tediously long menu. let’s visit the other sections one by one.first, there are the pastas, which tend to taste like something thrown together from leftovers. pasta e piselli ($19) features tubettini, like stunted rigatoni, tossed with peas and bacon, but deriving little smoky benefit from the bacon. and the peas taste exceedingly tired. nobody told the recipe developer that americans don’t much like small, stale peas in their pasta.similarly, the gnocchi alla sorrentina, named after a town on a peninsula south of naples that extends toward the isle of capri, are mushy and dull tasting. worst of all is genovese — big pasta tubes called paccheri in an oniony sludge too sweet by a mile, nothing like what the menu’s descriptor of “ragu” suggests. why even put them on the menu; who expects pizzaioli to make good pasta, anyway?not surprisingly, the apps mainly fail as well, including an adamantine version of fried calamari bested by nearly every bar in town, and salads that are mainly a heap of dry arugula and a few tomatoes that arrive entirely undressed. yes, good olive oil and a so-so bottle of balsamic appear on the side, but really this is just the beginning of an acceptable dressing.then there’s a starter that consists of an unadorned lump of mozzarella and a pile of flavorless mushrooms without as much as a shake of salt. overpriced at $21, it was as if someone proclaimed, “dig up some apps that won’t take us a bit of trouble to make and charge plenty for them.”but among the meat and contorni sections are at least a couple of gems. in the latter category, the sautéed escarole accented with black olives and capers is the soul of southern italian cooking, and the same vegetable served with grilled sausage is similarly delicious, though at $21 for a single split sausage, it doesn’t really reflect the generosity and abundance of the cuisine.at sorbillo pizzeria, one is wise to stick with the cheaper pizzas.cost: dinner for two, including one app or salad, one pizza, a pasta, and a bottle of wine, including tax but not tip, $110sample dishes: antica margherita pizza, calzone napoletano, salsicca e escarole (sausage and escarole)\\xa0 what to drink: while quirky, the wine list at sorbillo is great and reasonably priced. any bottle from feudi san gregorio is highly recommended, and at $30, their red rubrato is a steal. on the other hand, most pizza eaters in naples stick with beer or coca-cola.bonus tip: given the excellence of the wine list and the simpler pies, you might just treat this place as a wine bar; a bottle of wine and a pizza shared between two can be less than $50.the korean tasting menu from ellia park and junghyun park is the next evolution of fine dining, bringing a museum-like quality to a mealstephen king once quipped that “you have never seen a book entitled one hundred great introductions of western civilization or best-loved forewords of the american people,” and the same could be said of an opera program, a theater playbill, or a museum didactic, those detailed wall blurbs that try to make sense of a dali or a picasso. visitors, after all, don’t leave moma raving about a brilliantly penned caption; they rave about witnessing one of the world’s great collections. diners, just the same, don’t get excited about a thrilling rendition of menu copy. they get excited about good food and service.restaurants, like good books or paintings, are often best enjoyed as they are, without someone explaining what everything means before each new plate of pasta. that’s why, at first glance, one might raise an eyebrow at atomix, the tasting-menu sequel to small plates-centric atoboy. it’s a modern korean spot that produces as much reading material as it does food. after shelling out the full price of dinner online, guests descend to the lower floor of a midtown east townhouse, take seats around a marble chef’s counter, and spend the next two and hours drinking, eating, and chatting. and studying. eggplant with eel four ways — sauced, powdered, smoked, and moussed — practically melts on the tongue like fresh burrata. it’s a two-bite dish. and yet it’s accompanied by a menu card that’s 240 words long. the reading process literally takes longer than the eating process. the cards are repeated for each of the 10 or so courses. and against all odds (um, remember romera?), they help make atomix one of the city’s most exciting new bastions of haute gastronomie in years. as forgettable as it might be, a museum caption — or something like it — can sometimes offer just the right amount of guidance.ellia park, who runs atomix with her partner, chef junghyun park, places a card in front of me. on the front is a depiction of fish scales in abstract form. on the opposite side is a list of ingredients and small essay. i ignore it.servers, dressed in loose gray tops designed by sungho ahn, parade out plates of golden eye snapper colored like easter eggs. the skin shimmers in a vibrant hue of pink, while an omelet pancake covers the underbelly. the charcoal-singed exterior lends smoke and crunch to the fatty flesh, while the egg imparts a hint of sweetness. and a tiny quenelle of jinjang sauce — more on what that is in a second — adds an intense savoriness. nothing is complicated or ambiguous about the masterful dish; the components are enjoyable without additional explanation.but out of curiosity, i check the card, wondering what type of diesel-powered flavor motor was powering the sauce. traditional dried anchovy. and what was that wonderfully thick texture from? modernist flourishes like xanthan gum and agar agar, per a list of ingredients as long as that of a snickers bar. and a month after the meal, i read that little essay, about how the sauce owes its complexity to an aged soy called jinjang — that’s been fermented for five years. so what was apparently just another delicious dish is actually, the diner understands, something more meaningful and contextual, a blending of the new and the old.one of the chief ignominies of the modern tasting temple is that menus are either banished altogether or transformed into inscrutable lists of nouns (my favorite: “wagyu, porcini, garden”). neither option does much good when you’re trying to prime your palate for a one-bite course, or when you want something more detailed than an iphone pic to jog your memory following a long dinner. atomix’s cards solve that problem, letting guests focus on minor components they might overlook, like the dried sea cucumber innards used to season thinly sliced beef.but more broadly, the cards convey deeper meaning to anyone who wants to think beyond whether a meal simply tastes good, answering the type of questions that would otherwise involve recording an interview with the chef or buying a restaurant’s 10-pound coffee table cookbook. like an opera program that helps a viewer navigate the minutiae of tosca, or a gallery blurb that lets visitors make sense a perplexing cubist work, the menu cards serve an equally important purpose. they employ a bit of unobtrusive explaining to make a complicated and expensive art form more accessible.after a flight of amuses — the best of which is a tostitos-style scoop chip made from mussel juices instead of corn — a waiter presents guests a fabric case filled with chopsticks. some are blue and shiny. others are matte and textured. the gesture recalls a touch of absurdity that plagued the early days of alain ducasse at the essex house (rip), where guests were asked to choose their squab knives and pick from a cornucopia of pens with which to sign their (astronomical) bill.true to form, the parks command the type of prices one would expect for this style of dining: $175, or $225 after tax and service. that easily puts atomix in the same ballpark as some of the city’s venerable european, american, or japanese spots, venues with which it ably competes. for a menu of this length, it’s even a tidy sum less than jungsik ($290 after tax and tip), the two-michelin-starred bastion of korean fine dining in tribeca, where chef park served as the chef de cuisine. if jungsik is about elevating and refining traditional korean dishes, with its foie gras mandoo and its short-rib galbi, park’s cooking here is more freeform, treating the east asian peninsula more as a firm point of inspiration than a culinary bible. he forms a small nest out of slithery baby shrimp, anoints them with slices of radish pickled in cherry blossom vinegar, and juxtaposes the study in white with a puree of orange persimmon — all the colors of a creamsicle. the restrained sugars and floral notes wouldn’t feel out of place at a high-end kaiseki spot. he assembles banchan, the classic korean side dish, out of hokkaido uni, fresh tofu, and chestnut puree. the genius isn’t how the three flavors match — they don’t — it’s how the three powerful flavors register at the same level. even the soybean curd bursts with a next-degree earthiness.he pairs a french-style seared duck breast, preternaturally crispy and musky, with a thick paste whose complex notes of raisins, cumin, and chocolate recall... mexican food? the menu card, as it turns out, explains the sauce as a gochujang mole.like at almost any (and quite frankly too many) tasting-menu venues, stereotypical international luxuries make regular appearances here. but atomix’s use of them comes across less like a crutch, and more like a genuine innovation. the chef whittles halibut into a round disc. the first bite is soft, flaky, mild. a second bite reveals a layer of foie gras terrine underneath, imparting a buttery oomph to the neutral fish. a third bite causes the liver to spill out, clouding the surrounding pool of squash dashi with its pink hue. park eschews stereotypical caviar pairings. instead, he places firm beads of golden osetra atop a parfait of fresh cheese and pine-nut puree. the dairy tames the maritime oils while the sweet pignoli counteracts the roe’s rampant salts. the ingredients are absurdly refined, but the interplay of sugar, salt, and fat is little different than in a breakfast of pancakes with syrup, butter, and bacon. and while a few bits of wagyu are little different from their counterparts elsewhere, what is different are the accompaniments: a small pool of pear juice and a tidy row of fermented garlic, ramps, and wasabi leaves. their purpose is simple: to cut through the richness. the meal winds down with an ice of hydrangea tea, followed by a melange of corn marmalade, roasted corn, and sesame oil ice cream. the latter dessert channels the powerfully vegetal notes of maize with a level of subtlety that recalls the famed husk pudding at cosme, one of the city’s best mexican spots. atomix might be a korean restaurant, but like new york — or at least the new york we dream of — it earns its keep by transcending borders and defying trends.cost: $175 for the tasting, prepaid via tock, which works out to $226 after tax and 20 percent service. wine pairings are available for an additional $155.sample dishes: mussel tart with thistle leaf, wagyu with dried sea cucumber, white shrimp with persimmon, halibut with butternut squash dashi and foie gras, duck with gochujang mole, sesame oil ice cream with corn marmalade.bonus tip: a la carte small plates available at the bar (walk-ins only), including house-dried beef jerky and rice-stuffed fried chicken wings with numbing chopi powder.the east village chinese crawfish boil is a fiery, messy crustacean celebrationwithin view of cooper union, across from a ukrainian church, and down the block from mcsorley’s old ale house, new yorkers gather for a nightly festival of shirt-staining shellfish. this is le sia, where dungeness crabs, their black eyes peering over a cast-iron skillet, sit in a heady garlic and oyster sauce. crimson lobsters, with claws bigger than human hands, sop up a gravy of tingly sichuan peppercorns. and scarlet crawfish, at least 15 per pot, absorb a blend of pickled thai chile juices. waiters take by-the-pound orders via ipad, and the kitchen sends out the platters in 10 minutes or less, leaving beer-swigging patrons to gnaw on errant maritime appendages as destiny’s child plays in the background. life is good. and affordable.ordering a collection of shellfish is a frighteningly easy way to burn through a wad of cash in new york. multi-tiered fruits de mer platters run up to $170 at balthazar; catch in the meatpacking district charges $92 for king crab; and oriental garden commands dizzying prices for elegant preparations of crystal crab or geoduck. but the packed le sia asks just $15 for a pound of crawfish, $30 for whole lobsters, and $5 more for dungeness. an entire dinner for two will doubtfully cost more than $100 after tax and tip.le sia, a surprisingly accessible seafood spot, translates as “happy prawn.” the mandarin sia, or xia, also hints at the word for crawfish, xiaolongxia, the restaurant’s speciality. the bottom-feeding crustaceans, sometimes known as mountain lobsters, crawdads, yabbies, or mudbugs, have been part of gulf coast cajun cuisine for centuries, but are still relatively new to the china; they were brought from the states through japan as food for bullfrogs in the 1920s. and while crawfish were once the bane of regional rice farmers, they have become, largely over the past few decades, part of a multibillion-dollar industry that employs over 5 million, primarily in the hubei, anhui, hunan, and jiangsu provinces. the chinese are now the world’s largest producers, and possibly consumers, of crawfish.cooks at le sia prepare the xiaolongxia in the typical mainland fashion, boiling the creatures in aromatic broth before wok-frying them in one of six sauces, the most famous of which is “13 flavors.” supposedly developed in the 1990s in xuyi, where there’s an entire museum dedicated to crawfish, the sauce involves an umami-rich blend of clove, star anise, angelica dahurica, nutmeg, ginger, fennel, black cardamom, sichuan peppercorn, dried tangerine peel, cinnamon, and galangal. the hodgepodge of spices are used to fortify a shellfish stock that’s cooked until it’s as dark and flavorful as the brown goo that spills out of a scorched shrimp head.patrons don plastic gloves (don’t even bother with chopsticks) and black bibs (which will save your shirts, not your pants). they rip the crustaceans in two, push out the sweet tail meat with their thumbs, and slurp up the heady, spicy juices from the thorax. gloves are licked, noses are blown, and chile-triggered sinuses are cleared. the financial times reported last year that this style of crawfish eating was highly social because it effectively prevented people from checking their phones; i’m embarrassed to say it didn’t stop me or anyone else in the room from doing precisely that.le sia is the brainchild of debut restaurateurs tina chen and yang liu, as well as chef zac zheng, who previously worked at the spendy peking duck chain dadong. their goal was to serve the crawfish they grew up with in their native china, though they’re also filling in a larger new york gastronomic gap; american crawfish boils aren’t in high supply in the city, be they of the lean louisiana variety or the viet-cajun garlic-butter-lemongrass style popular in houston. it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to name le sia one of the most exhilarating places to eat shellfish in the big apple.the setting is simple: a single rectangle of a room with wood-paneled floors, a brick wall, metal stools, and a few firm leather booths. large shellfish platters sit on most tables; smart guests supplement those feasts with grilled skewers, from chewy five-spice-dusted squid legs to crispy chitlins to beef tendon as soft as gummy bears to cumin-laced balls of juicy, fatty lamb. in deference to the mudbug traditions of the gulf coast, there’s also a crawfish jambalaya — really a perfectly greasy fried rice, studded with bits of sweet tail meat. the grains are best dunked in one of the boil sauces, letting the rice act as a conveyance mechanism for all the dark, drippy fats.the founders plan on opening additional locations in midtown and near columbia, though there’s something fitting about a flagship on seventh street near third avenue. there’s long been an abundance of east asian restaurants in the east village, from sichuan spots to korean wing joints to ramen shacks. still, the steady stream of contemporary chinese restaurants constitutes an important culinary reality: young operators from the prc and taiwan are using the east village as a testing ground for introducing manhattanites to (and reminding expatriates of) the harder-to-find specialties of their respective homelands. i’m thinking of the cold skin noodles of x’ian famous foods, the fiery dry pots of mala project, the yunnanese mixian soups of little tong, and now, the messy seafood boils of le sia.the significance of these venues can’t be underestimated. as larger restaurant groups throughout the city continue to spawn overpriced french-italian-american copycats, smaller-scale restaurateurs of chinese descent are advancing a more exigent cause: they’re ensuring that the east village, which gave birth to momofuku, prune, and other great venues over a decade ago, remains one of the most vital, unique, and diverse places to eat in manhattan.here’s a quick guide on what to order: start with skewers, though keep in mind they might arrive either before, during, or after the boils. for respite from the spicy shellfish, consider a side of cool mung bean noodles, sauced with the traditional blend of salty (and mild) chiles, or a clean bowl of tomato soup, with little globules of dough and egg floating about. as for the boils, keep in mind that the crawfish require a lot of work for not a whole lot of nourishment.  shrimp offer a more approachable head-sucking experience, with easier access to a heftier quantity of flesh. snow crab, in turn, is filled with an abundance of soft, sugary insides — the proper foil for le sia’s gently bitter and powerfully aromatic garlic sauce. best of all is the dungeness crab, teeming with meat as soft as cotton and packing a deep oceanic tang; it stands alone, but becomes otherworldly when drenched in the incendiary 13 flavors gravy.the individual sauces, which can be matched with any shellfish, are all offered at four different levels of heat. spicy, the third hottest, should be tolerable for most diners, while “fire” provides just enough kick to induce a touch of extra beer drinking.waiters consistently drop the check before patrons can ask for dessert; that’s just as well, since the only sweets are outsourced green tea, vanilla, or red bean ice cream. and quite frankly, there’s something to be said for giving up one’s table to make room for the throngs waiting up front. let the people have their xiaolongxia!cost: crawfish or shrimp at $15 per pound, snow crab legs at $25 per pound, lobsters at $30 each, whole dungeness crab at $35. seafood and meat skewers are priced at $1.50 to $3.sample dishes: assorted grilled skewers (lamb, beef, tendon, chitlin, squid feet, chicken wings, pork belly), mung bean jelly, dough drop soup, spicy seafood boils by the pound, fried breadsticks, fried dough twists.bonus tip: crawfish are a seasonal crustacean; le sia imports them live from louisiana from january to july, then switches to california specimens until october, after which they’ll use frozen ones from spain. plan your visit accordingly!of all the tableside service routines — flambeing, liquid nitrogen dipping, cacio e pepe-ing in a cheese wheel, dover sole deboning — the one that’s often the most transformative is also the least obtrusive: the a la minute pour. you’ve seen it a thousand times: a waiter takes a carafe and artfully spills it over your plate with the flick of a wrist. roll your eyes all you want, but there’s a purpose here. it’s about technique — ensuring a steamy broth doesn’t overcook, say, langoustines while they’re en route to the dining room. and it’s about storytelling — watching a monochromatic fish, perhaps black bass, come into focus as its surroundings are drenched in a black truffle puree.  execution, of course, is half the battle, which brings us to soogil, an ambitious east village korean spot by chef soogil lim. a waiter ferries over a pot of steamed tofu flan, a white canvas garnished with pink shrimp, littleneck clams, crosshatched squid, verdant scallions, and crimson chiles. and then it all slowly disappears as the server picks up a tiny kettle and pours an opaque seafood broth; the soup’s ferric hue suggests day turning to dusk. to be precise, that’s how it all looks in fancy online photos. it was served to me differently. a waiter walked over and dumped in the broth before i had a chance to see what was inside. it was an oversight that turned something visually striking, a collection of kaleidoscopic ingredients a chef put a lot of care into plating, into something pedestrian. it looked like any other bowl of soup. it’s not the only time service gets in the way of a meal here.“i wish la would embrace modern korean cuisine like nyc has,” eater los angeles editor and korean food expert matthew kang tweeted last year. indeed, while southern california’s largest city is famous for its deep bench of traditional korean spots, new york is making a name for itself with more contemporary riffs on that country’s fare. there’s jungsik, with its $225 caviar and wagyu-laced tasting menus; jeju, a sleek noodle shop slinging some of the city’s most elegant (and fiery) ramyun broths; oiji, a breathtaking small-plates place that drizzles gochugaru butter over abalone; and cote, the country’s only michelin-starred korean barbecue spot, a venue as famous for its prime galbi as its pink and boozy frosé.when my friends visit new york, a modern korean spot, alongside a jewish deli or a brooklyn barbecue joint, is increasingly among the first few places i’ll recommend. and while soogil, which opened four months ago, isn’t quite as consistent as its peers, some of its work-in-progress dishes are delicious enough experiments to merit a meal.take that tableside seafood soup again. the broth tasted of chile-laced ocean. the squid, in turn, was tender and almost creamy, while the shrimp were sweet if aggressively overcooked. and the steamed layer of tofu exhibited the softness of a marshmallow but packed an earthiness that conjured up visions of roasted corn. when kitchen and service staff get this dish right, and i’m betting they will, it will be one of the city’s great seafood preparations.lim certainly has the pedigree of an overperformer. he spent seven years working at daniel, one of the city’s most respected french restaurants, before moving on to an executive chef position at hanjan, a heralded korean gastropub in the flatiron district. at soogil, he likes to blend those asian and gallic sensibilities. such efforts are not always successful. every few minutes a loud hiss and sizzle echoes through the room, a cloud of steam rises up over someone’s table, and for a few brief seconds, the entire restaurant smells of caramel. this is the result of a waiter pouring soy over a hot metal plate, the final flourish for a dish of foie gras atop crispy rice. this tableside pomp, alas, is for naught; the kitchen sears the duck liver to a meaty medium rare, but the rice is simply a disc of hot mush, with little of the promised crunch.better are the medallions of monkfish, soft and delicate above a spicy layer of lobster sauce. or consider the elegant slices of mackerel, gently grilled and placed over nigiri-length satchels of swiss chard-wrapped rice, the grains laced with just enough ssamjang to faintly sting the tongue.soogil is a handsome little restaurant, a single room with blonde wood tables, brown plank floors, and exposed brick walls. dining here can be a profoundly relaxing experience; one can sip on cold kimchi soup, a brilliant foil to warm, stretchy sweet potato beignets, while overlooking the trees of fourth street, visible through the open doors. also visible through the doors, on one night, is a crowd of 10 folks, some of them standing around waiting to be acknowledged by a host.dining here can also be stressful. one staffer might forget your drink, while another might take away your jar of rice beer away before it’s finished. if you’re sitting at the counter, servers sometimes talk across you to the bartender, as if they were patrons at a murray hill watering hole waiting to get a vodka soda. i watched a frustrated patron struggle to get a check, then flag down another server to retrieve her credit card, which didn’t come back with the bill. good food helps some of these mishaps fade into the background; such is the case with a mung-bean pancake. lim deep-fries the pork fat-laced batter until the exterior has a deep, almost mahogany crunch. the resulting creation, topped with a tart slaw of kimchi, could easily pass for a high-grade chicken croquet in a blind taste test. then you wait nearly half an hour for a main course, a few blubbery slabs of pork belly; luckily, the accompanying radish kimchi rolls, a wallop of restrained bitterness, stand on their own with aplomb.spicy chicken is a solid entrant into the poultry category; the kitchen stews drumsticks with gochugaru and root vegetables until they are chopstick tender and infused with the savory oomph of salted shrimp sauce. those looking to sate their beef fix might try the floppy little mops of deftly seared eye round; they sit atop a soft pile of japchae noodles. the soy- and sugar-braised short rib, by contrast, needs work; it’s a slab of gray, sinewy meat, with scant tenderness, beefiness, or sweetness.desserts also have a steep hill to climb. there are just two: a fine, forgettable nest of chewy fried dough with honey chestnut gelato, and a leaden passionfruit tart, denser than overchilled supermarket pudding and without any of the fruit’s naturally vibrant acidity. with a modern korean scene so competitive, soogil will need to improve. cost: pretty affordable! most shared plates are $16 or under, though the foie gras crispy rice is $23, while the larger short rib is $26.sample dishes: sweet potato beignets with chilled white kimchi, glass noodles with bulgogi, spanish mackerel with swiss chard-wrapped rice, mung-bean pancake, organic spicy chicken.bonus tip: check online reservations before swinging by as a walk-in, because even bar seats, which can be booked in advance, sometimes get snatched up a few days out at the busiest times. the sleek new prospect heights restaurant delivers on iranian flavors with a stunningly complex saffron rice, but service and other dishes are still unevenwhen rice was primarily a staple, “a stomach filler, a vehicle for other foods,” it was, and often still is, “simply cooked by steaming,” author najmieh batmanglij writes in her excellent a taste of persia. but as modern cultivation methods developed over the centuries “the grain itself became a luxury,” she states, stressing that this was the case in iran, as in asia. her geographic comparison is an astute one. the most expensive rice is generally sushi rice; aficionados tend to comment on its vinegar and temperature levels as if they were praying to a first-growth bordeaux. but during whatever little discussion there is about iranian cuisine in new york, rice itself is rarely mentioned as the complex indulgence it can be. the process of making saffron rice can involve rinsing the grains up to five times, parboiling them, steaming them, and gently scorching the bottom layer to form a nutty, golden crust called tahdig.it’s a recipe whose steps are as precise as those of a more heralded paella or risotto. and when made correctly, as it often is at sofreh, a modern persian spot in prospect heights, it is as worthy of anything that an omakase chef anoints with tuna belly as part of a $250 tasting. the rice is firm, almost al dente. like a mound of good caviar, the grains roll around on the tongue separately, without clumping. the dish smells richly of butter. on the palate, the flavor starts as vaguely sweet, and is then followed by the unmistakable pungency of saffron. it is not difficult to find decent saffron rice at the city’s kebab-heavy persian spots; it mostly comes free as a side dish. at the skewer-free sofreh, by contrast, this masterful version justifiably carries a separate charge, steakhouse style. even next to gently griddled patties of ground beef in a pomegranate sauce, the strikingly nuanced rice steals the show.sofreh is an ode to the multitudinous flavors of iran, from fruit-studded meat plates to sour ash soups to its use of rose in everything. it is also very much a work in progress. food shows up before drink orders are taken. drink orders take ages to arrive. crumbs and errant splotches of mint-oil-infused eggplant puree (pretty delicious stuff) can sit on the table for uncomfortably long periods of time before things are wiped clean. tahdig, sold separately from the saffron rice (as is the norm), exhibits the texture of a plastic toy.and poorly cooked meat dishes leave the kitchen more frequently than they should; i’m thinking of a sad gray lamb shank and arid beef meatballs that tasted like they died under a heat lamp.but then you take a bite of dill- and cilantro-studded rice, and sofreh’s problems seem to fade away. you’re willing to look past the inconveniences when you tear off a ragged, sesame-studded chunk of sourdough tabrizi and dunk it into what looks like a bland, monochromatic yogurt sauce. that puckery dairy hides a dose of refreshment in the form of diced cucumbers — a typical pairing at local iranian restaurants — and a less common squish of sweetness from a fistful of plump golden raisins, an addition that’s common in the chef’s native isfahan.the chef-owner in question is nasim alikhani. she ended her law studies at tehran university in the years that followed the islamic revolution, leaving for the states in 1983. in the new york decades that followed, she worked as a nanny, cooked for persian families, catered, opened and sold a printing business, went back to school, and, during the six years it took to ready sofreh (briefly: landmark regulations got in the way), attended culinary school and traveled throughout iran.pulpy 1970s movies posters in the restroom.designing the restaurant was a tripartite effort with her husband, theodore petroulas, and art director rozhia tabnak, whom alikhani described as “like a niece” during a phone interview. the family-like collaboration yielded an unmistakably sleek venue: gray tables, walnut chairs, calligraphy carved into the walls, a bathroom plastered with pulpy iranian movie posters from the 1970s, and swooping arches in the bar area that recall the great safavid architecture of the 15th century. the stark white bar acts as a stunning background for a bright rose fizz, a pink-hued highball that transforms gin, lemon, cream, and egg white into pure, fragrant, effervescent froth. it is a fine accompaniment to a relish of pitted olives, a mind-bender of a starter wherein the briny vegetable is tamed through a sweet slick of pomegranate molasses and a crumble of soft walnuts. new iranian restaurants in new york are a rarity, a reality that won’t be helped by president trump’s travel ban, which indefinitely prohibits the issuance of immigrant or non-immigrant visas to citizens of the islamic republic.and while new york boasts the country’s second-biggest population of iranians behind los angeles — where the diaspora is the largest outside of iran — most local persian spots tend to serve reasonably uniform, kebab-laden menus, often in stodgy white-tablecloth settings. this older class of venues, from persepolis to ravagh, ranks with with classic steakhouses and korean barbecue spots as some of the best places to eat meat in new york.new york, however, lacks the pulsating diversity of la’s iranian community, packed with cafes, sandwich shops, bakeries, ice cream parlors, and even a persian pizzeria. in this regard, sofreh’s more contemporary cooking — and bare tabletops — functions as a compelling change of pace. alikhani’s cooking also serves as a vital counterpoint to the city’s larger middle eastern culinary scene, where the diverse foodways of the muslim majority region are often filtered through the lenses of israeli-born chefs like einat admony, meir adoni, and eyal shani.alikhani stands poised to help local iranian food evolve. she says her dishes are elegant takes on traditional homestyle preparations rather than, say, riffs on what’s coming out of the kitchens at tehran’s more cutting edge-restaurants. for example: she prefers not to fully immerse meats or fish in liquid, as is common in persian cooking. instead, she slowly cooks a melange of plum, saffron, and barberries by themselves, preparing the chicken separately, on the griddle a la minute. the result is a supremely crispy and flavorful bird, with a sauce underneath that bursts with muted sweetness. she does the same for halibut, letting the pan-seared fish speak for itself, new american-style, atop a puree of onions, herbs, and tamarind. the mixture vibrates with a type of sourness that is quintessentially iranian and straight up wildair.  if rice is where sofreh (usually) excels, desserts are where it dominates; its saffron ice cream is simply smoother than elsewhere. its yogurt parfait, topped with a neon orange-carrot jam, could easily take on spendier versions at fashionable breakfast spots around town. its puckery faloodeh, icy vermicelli with rosewater and lemon sorbet, lacks the cloying sweetness that brings down this affair at other restaurants. and a pale white-rice custard packs a wonderfully coarse, horchata-like texture to convey the lemon-tinged flavor of cardamom.sofreh, despite its flaws, is a vital addition to this year’s already strong crop of new restaurants.cost: starters at $14 or less, with all but one main (the spicy fish) under $30. desserts are $8. sofreh is a touch more expensive than other persian spots, but is priced on par with most contemporary new york restaurants.sample dishes: grilled eggplant with caramelized onions, yogurt, and mint oil; cucumber yogurt dip with raisins; ash herb and noodle stew; half chicken with plum and saffron sauce; halibut with herb and tamarind sauce; saffron ice cream; rose custard with pistachio.bonus tip: those who enjoy sofreh really should consider the city’s other fine persian spots, including ravagh and persepolis, two venues that are distinctly less crowded (if less hip). the restaurant from angie rito and scott tacinelli is the rare red sauce spot that challenges dinersitalian-american restaurants are simple. they’re not known for their freewheeling interpretations of classics or elegantly composed small plates; instead, they’re cultural treasures famous for adherence to tradition, having provided unfussy nourishment to new yorkers since the early 20th century. they’re places where the marinara is cooked until it’s as crimson as a fire engine and where a chef’s visual style is best described as “make sure the food fits on the plate.”the point of a red sauce joint is not to surprise, but to sate, which is what makes don angie in the west village such a curious outlier. it does both. chefs angie rito and scott tacinelli make their own amari, not out of obscure bitter herbs but rather out of sarsaparilla (it tastes like boozy root beer). they crust chicken scarpariello with a layer of fennel sausage and serve it sliced, giving it the appearance of an elegant french terrine. and they make garlic bread by stuffing sesame-seeded flatbread with stracchino and parmesan. the nutty, stretchy affair is closer to a ligurian focaccia di recco or an indian cheese paratha than the toasty, mozzarella-topped product with which most suburbanites are familiar. “i wouldn’t have known this was italian-american food if you hadn’t told me,” a companion admitted during a meal here, which means don angie is doing what so many other cuisines are allowed to do: surprise (and challenge) diners just a little bit, and by doing so, evolve.once upon a time, new york had another don angie of sorts. its name was torrisi, and it opened in 2010. it was a tiny tasting spot that sought a freeform future for red sauce fare, serving up dishes that both celebrated italian-american cooking and exalted new york multiculturalism. there were high-end riffs on manhattan clam chowder, cantonese-style chicken oysters, jamaican beef patty ragus, and manischewitz-glazed lamb chops. as a sequel, the team behind torrisi opened the more retro-minded carbone, embracing the traditions of yesteryear, reinterpreting postwar italian-american chophouses through better techniques, better ingredients, stratospheric prices, and scattered godfather and goodfellas references. it wouldn’t take too long for carbone to pop up elsewhere, in las vegas and hong kong, just as olive garden expanded to mexico city and kuwait. torrisi, in turn, would close after five years. like it so often does, nostalgia won out over more forward-looking innovation.don angie picks up where torrisi left off; rito was a longtime chef at that tasting-menu restaurant. and while the digs are decidedly old-school — rounded archways, warm lighting, checkered floors — the high levels of acid and global influences make the venue the italian-american equivalent of a french neobistro. that is to say: the chefs took a staid genre, updated it, internationalized it, refined dishes here and there, but kept everything pretty affordable. clockwise from top left: the dining room at don angie; pepperoni fried rice with squid; the restaurant’s summertime sidewalk patio; a chrysanthemum caesar saladthis type of smart creativity isn’t what one expects from the operator: quality branded, a group known for its reliable food yet somewhat gimmicky flourishes, be it park avenue, a restaurant that changes its decor with the seasons, or quality italian, whose kitchen tacinelli and rito oversee as well. at that latter venue, the duo earned a certain degree of fame (or notoriety?) for grinding up chicken and frying it up into the shape of a parm pizza for, like, $60.don angie’s subversions are more studied. prosciutto with melon — the sweet-salty staple of hotel conference buffets — finds new life here thanks to toasted hazelnuts, for crunch, and tamarind, for pucker. the chefs reimagine caesar salad, a dish created by an italian immigrant living in mexico, by swapping out the lettuce for a canopy of herbaceous chrysanthemum. when finished with parmesan, the dish packs the fluffy texture of cotton candy.  rito and tacinelli send out snapper tartare hidden under a layer of raw trumpet mushrooms, ignacio mattos style, amping up the fungi flavors of a tart porcini dashi. and they throw together a superb fried rice, lacing the grains with pepperoni, charring the bottom layer like a spanish paella, and topping it all off with a silky mound of seared calamari. the dish reflects an understanding of italian-american fare that recalls the way empellon’s alex stupak approaches mexican cuisine; it’s not so much a classically elevated preparation as it is a take on red sauce fare as a larger set of ideas. italian-american restaurants have long been some of the city’s toughest tables, from the aforementioned carbone in greenwich village to rao’s in east harlem. “more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at don angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club,” pete wells wrote in his two-star review early this spring. reservations still book up well in advance, but walk-ins are usually accommodated at the bar in under 45 minutes or so, a wait that will admittedly lengthen when the patio closes for the winter. one could easily justify any sort of wait, quite frankly, for don angie’s cantaloupe caramelle. the kitchen takes black and yellow dough — as vivid as the colors of a pittsburgh steelers uniform — and cuts it into oblong dumplings, stuffing each sachet with buffalo milk ricotta and twisting the ends like old-fashioned candy bar wrappers. the dairy oozes out from the caramelle when pierced, softening the agrodolce rush of a pickled cantaloupe sauce. the pairing recalls a 1980s-style blend of cottage cheese and fruit, taken to michelin-worthy heights. my companion called it a failed experiment. i call it perfect.equally stunning are the sopressini with smoked mussels, the folds of pasta slicked with an electric emulsion of pimenton, anchovy sauce, lime, sriracha, and cilantro. one could turn the sauce into a sandwich spread and it would taste no less refined.for mains: skip the shell steak, burdened under a layer of confit lemon thick enough to count as cake frosting. better is the orata, sitting in a pool of mexican-style guajillo oil, lending just a gentle flicker of smoke. veal da pepi, perhaps the city’s best rendition of milanese, exhibits layers of flavor and texture that would wow a tempura chef. the softness of the meat, the crunch of the fry, the saltiness of the prosciutto topping, and the deep, rich flavors of carraway are a rare hat tip to tradition here.in addition to a few standard desserts — a mascarpone-heavy tiramisu, a zeppole with honey — there’s something that looks precisely like a ball of mozzarella with olive oil. as if. in this little bit of trompe l’oeil, the chefs mold house-made mochi around obscenely milky fior di latte gelato. this classic japanese pairing of rice flour and ice cream is often stretchy and edible with one’s hands — not too dissimilar, in theory, from fresh mooz. problem is, don angie serves it at a temperature so low it requires a bit of knife-and-fork action. it evokes cheese that’s spent too much time in the fridge. that’s a small gripe, however, for a dish that essentially manages to reinvent mozzarella. sometimes a risk is more exhilarating than perfect execution or deference to tradition. that’s a lesson more italian-american spots could learn.cost: starters under $18; pastas under $25; mains under $34. lasagna for two is $65; prime rib braciole for two is $116. desserts under $11.sample dishes: stuffed garlic flatbread, chrysanthemum caesar, squid fried rice, buffalo milk caramelle, sopressini and smoked mussels, chicken scarpariello, veal “da pepi,” fior di latte mochi.bonus tip: reservations can be tough to come by; walk-ins are accommodated at the bar or at the outdoor tables without too ridiculous a wait.crackling pork belly and crunchy squid beautifully sputter at the new jersey importwho doesn’t love hash? though the term is originally french, this mince-up of meat morsels is common to many culinary cultures as a method of using scraps and leftovers. one of the tastiest comes from the island of luzon in the philippines, home to the capital of manila. dubbed sisig, it started out as a tart papaya salad in the 18th century (“sisigan” means “to make it tart” in tagalog), but by the 20th century, it was being fabricated with finely minced pig-head and liver. according to one story, this version was invented by local filipinos using pig parts discarded by cooks at an american air force base in angeles city.true story or not, sisig exploded in popularity after world war ii, when the larders of the country expanded, and cooks began using other main ingredients. when the dish came to be served in a hot cast-iron skillet as a favorite street food, an alliterative modifier was added and “sizzling sisig” was born. its popularity here in america only increased when anthony bourdain lauded it as a drinking snack: “i think sisig is perfectly positioned to win the hearts and minds of the world as a whole…exactly what you need after a few beers.”mama fina’s house of filipino sisig seems intent on fulfilling that promise. this new alphabet city restaurant is a branch of an elmwood park, new jersey mainstay that opened in 2004. occupying the former moonstruck eatery on avenue a just south of 11th street, the bar and dining room have been decorated with philippine fork art: rustic pottery, sculptures made from screws and bolts, and peacock serving trays of inlaid tropical woods. ornate wrought-iron lamps, flagstone floor, and weathered wood walls also fill the space.chef aming sta maria (pronounced “santa maria”) is responsible for a bill of fare that offers six sizzling sisigs ($17 each). there’s the pork prototype, of course, which she makes not with pig head but with pork belly, which includes crackling skin and plenty of meat and fat, delivered to the table sputtering. the squid sisig outdoes it in the crunch department, though chopped so fine it’s difficult to make out individual pieces of mollusk. the tofu sisig boasts a nicely browned dice of firm bean curd, lots of purple onions, and a white gravy that tastes like coconut milk and mayo, though there’s no actual coconut in it. but we’ll never really know what’s in it, because the sisig recipes are sta maria’s carefully guarded secret.chicken sisig isn’t as good because the chicken registers as limp and bland compared with the other key ingredients. if you want chicken, go for the menu section called philippine barbecue. chicken wings grilled till the skin is smoky and partly blackened is painted with a peanut sauce that owes less to peanut butter and more to barbecue sauce. it comes with a vinegary dip and a mound of java rice, which is orange with turmeric and slightly spicy.my favorite dish also deploys peanuts. kare-kare ($24) is an oxtail stew with thick peanut gravy, which exudes flavors of garlic and onions, savory without a trace of sweetness. bonus green beans and okra are flung on top; mix them in or pick them off to eat separately, as you wish. among the other massive feeds is crispy pata, a heap of roast pork piled helter skelter on a tray, a perfect dish for those who like to poke among the fragments for the fattiest or crispest pieces. this dish would be equally at home in a greenpoint polish restaurant.despite the predominance of pork, chicken, and seafood as the focus of most dishes, veggies are not entirely neglected. laing is a mound of coarsely chopped taro leaves in thick coconut milk, with several shrimp riding shotgun on top. langka is a similar dish, made with jackfruit, a starchy football that gets tossed with chunks of pork in coconut sauce. this pairing is particularly interesting, because unripe jackfruit is sometimes thought of as a pork substitute. the color of the dish is an arresting shade of off-white.breakfast is a filipino passion, and a roster is offered throughout the day even though the restaurant doesn’t open till 2 p.m. on weekdays and 11 a.m. on saturdays and sundays. all breakfasts consist of a pair of over-easy eggs and a heap of garlic rice, plus a choice of grilled longanisa sausage, a pile of sweet pork, or one of two milkfish options. also known as bangus, the fish is offered whole, and picking it apart is a pleasant challenge. eat the skin, too.save room for dessert. the flan is firm and nicely coated with burnt sugar syrup, the fried bananas known as turon might be mistaken for lumpia until you bite into them, but best of all is halo-halo ($12), a shaved ice speckled with seemingly random ingredients like red beans and kernel corn in a sweet syrup. on top is a ball of ice cream so intensely purple, you might have dropped acid before eating it. what’s the flavor? ube, a purple yam that’s only one of the many, many attractions of filipino cuisine.cost: dinner for two, including one sisig and rice, a vegetable dish such as laing, and halo-halo dessert, plus two beers, including tax but not tip, $55.sample dishes: tofu sizzling sisig, smoked bangus breakfast, crispy pata (roast pork), leche flanwhat to drink: philippine san miguel beer or canned calanmasi soft drink, made with miniature citrus fruits native to the islands.bonus tip: you are well advised to go to mama fina’s with a group and try lots of things. also, the serving size for most dishes is gigantic, each easily satisfying three or four diners. not all dishes are available every day, so consult the online menu and call ahead to ensure availability.the new a la carte bar menu brings accessibility back to david chang’s experimental fine dining flagshipmomofuku ko, the two-michelin-starred jewel of david chang’s empire, has always peppered its tastings with high-wire whimsy, from teetering trout roe mille-feuilles to basil-seed lily ponds to shavings of frozen foie gras that melt like snowflakes. and yet in 2018, the restaurant’s most matrix-like mind-bender of a dish is somehow the humble chicken drumstick. the chicken is fried four times, at rigorous two-minute intervals, in a slurry of cornstarch, flour, vodka, and beer. it is re-battered in between each fry, and finished with a brushing of mirin, yuzu, and green tabasco. what the chef places in front of you, on a gray ceramic plate, isn’t so much a normal drumstick as it is a puffy, golden, yogi-bear-picnic-basket fantasy of what a chicken wing should look like. the drumstick is cold. this is by design. generations of humans have enjoyed chilled fried chicken in more familiar environs — one thinks of a sunday picnic in a grassy park — but it’s hard to think of a refrigerator bird with this much crunch. the firm skin shatters like a butterfinger bar, while the sweet-spicy-citrusy glaze, an american take on yuzu kosho, counteracts all the salty fats of the meat. normally, the price of a meal at ko is $255, reservations only. the quadruple-fried wing, however, is only available in ko’s new a la carte bar room, where it sells for just $7, walk-ins only.ten years ago, as the u.s. economy slipped into its longest downward spiral since world war ii, chang opened the original ko on first avenue. with an $85 menu, it felt like a permanent recession special of a restaurant — at least by fancypants standards. the chef, barely 30, was already a legend for redefining ambitious american cuisine as affordable, asian-accented small plates at his nearby ssäm bar. but ko’s nose-thumbing at the haute establishment was even bolder. everything about the place was (classically) wrong: the cramped counter seating, the expletive-spewing chefs, the alt-rock soundtrack, the fried mcdonald’s-style apple pies, the online-only reservations. it felt as if the ko revolution would democratize fine dining forever. it would not. in fact, there’s never been a worse time in the past decade to seek out accessible luxury than now. new york is still one of the u.s.’s culinary capitals, but the changian notion of democratized fine dining has proved illusory. once-approachable tasting joints (aska, brooklyn fare, atera) have skyrocketed into the upper stratosphere of prices. major food group pivoted from $50 set menus at torrisi italian specialties (rip) to power spots so expensive they don’t even publish the prices online. and what’s replacing those more reasonable-ish venues? nothing, really; dinner at any one of the city’s dozen or so new omakase joints will easily run $350-plus per person.momofuku ko, in turn, relocated to a larger space off the bowery, adopted more refined dishes (rip fried apple pies), and eventually started charging roughly $1,000 for a wine-paired dinner for two. i awarded it four stars in 2015; it’s without question one of the city’s great restaurants. but in this rich person’s playland that is contemporary new york, ko’s evolution meant that cash-strapped gourmands had lost a sanctuary.ko’s bar room, which opened in february, marks the return of that sanctuary.there are 15 table seats, a small island for stand-up cocktailing, hefty soundproofing, and the centerpiece, a blonde eight-seat bar. you’ll want to sit at that bar, as it overlooks the new test kitchen, where chef sean gray and others glaze duck pies with painter’s brushes and grill crepes over the binchotan. the crepe ($8) is made from from the same sourdough starter that fuels the bread service in the main room. here, it imparts the savory pastry with such a remarkable tang it recalls the acidity of injera. the grilling gives it a distinct sweetness and a chew not dissimilar to a fruit roll-up, while a brushing of aged butter adds a marked cheesy funk. there is no other bread course in the city like it. it’s also hard to think of a new york dish comparable to the tandoori firefly squid. cooks sear the torpedo-shaped creatures — they look like miniaturized beasts from a guillermo del toro flick — in a blend of coriander, paprika, garlic, onions, and soy. they exhibit a handsome bronze hue and pack the flavors of smoke and brine — with a bit of squishiness thanks to their oceanic guts. equally stunning is the chaud-froid of shrimp. gray rips the shells off of raw spot prawns, dredges the slithery bodies through a sambal-spiked gelee, then tops them off with the fried head, a warm, crunchy counterpoint to all the cool crustacean creaminess.pinning down precisely what strain of global eclecticism a momofuku restaurant specializes in is a particular type of modern trivia question. at the moment, chef gray’s food is modern american-french-japanese with nods to south and southeast asia, all served in a style that’s more refined and a touch more expensive than ssäm bar. most dishes on the 16-item menu, written in hand in a cute little notebook, are under $35. that’s not a bad price for what’s nearly a four-star meal.the team at ko built the bar room to “create a space for tasting-menu research and development,” per its website. that’s a heck of a mission statement; fine dining empires typically begin their innovations in more upscale environs, only later letting them trickle down to the masses. grant achatz’s famous black-truffle explosion, now available for $18 in the time warner center, started as a bite at the $500-per-person alinea. and wolfgang puck’s smoked-salmon pizza, not an uncommon sight at his airport kiosks, started its lifespan at his once uber-exclusive spago.so in a world where culinary experimentation can command caviar-like markups, it’s refreshing to know that the cheaper half of ko is inspiring the more expensive half. that’s all the more appropriate for a restaurant group like momofuku, which started slinging ramen before it launched a tasting-menu venue, rather than the other way around.one night at ko’s bar, halibut arrived in a dashi with soybeans. garnishing the fillet was a confit of the fish’s own skin and cheeks, cooked down with pepperoncini and sumac. the chewy bits were mahogany in color and packed the smoky, umami richness of reconstituted bonito flakes. a few nights later the same fish came as a round cake, laced with verdant chiles and slathered in a cauliflower porridge that somehow tasted like daikon. gray says he might adapt both dishes for the tasting — perhaps serving the cake next to the dashi alone, with the confit as a condiment. this is what makes the bar at ko so damn fascinating: it gives diners a peek into the restaurant’s works in progress, near-blockbusters, and potential failures, without pledging one’s rent check to the full menu. and then there are the more straightforward dishes: an endive and frisee salad as boring as any other, a competent blend of foie gras and duck in puff pastry ($45), and a charcoal-grilled strip loin ($34) packing as much dry-aged tang as steakhouse versions costing twice as much.guests of the main dining room, for now, will miss out on some distinctly thrilling bar fare, like the mandarin tart tatin, with shavings of sharp cheddar that counteract the bitter oranges, as well as the naked pruner cheesecake, an egg white-heightened loaf that melts on the tongue like the venue’s famous foie gras. the bar might not be the four-star side of ko — service can be a touch uneven here — but the fact that the walk-in half of the restaurant is the more exciting half suggests that chang and gray remain committed to momofuku’s iconoclastic, accessible roots. rock on.cost: all but two dishes at $31 or under, service included. the two exceptions: $45 duck pie and $100 caviar (50 grams, a good deal).\\xa0sample dishes: sourdough crepe, cold fried chicken, firefly squid, dry-aged strip loin, spicy pickled daikon and radish, japanese cheesecakebonus tip: the bar opens at 3 p.m., if you’re looking for a late lunch! also note that the cocktail bar in the formal dining room has been removed; the shorter prix-fixe bar menu has been eliminated as well.anthony mangieri’s once-supreme pies have lost some of their luster, especially at $25 apiecewhen andrea clurfeld of the asbury park press reviewed a small jersey shore restaurant in 1997, she used the type of exuberant yet technical language one might associate with a french fine dining palace. except this was a humble pie joint — una pizza napoletana. the baker was anthony mangieri. the ingredients were imported from italy. and the recipe for the naturally leavened dough was “handed down by the gods,” clurfeld wrote.mangieri, alas, would shutter his first pizzeria. he relocated to the east village in 2004, at a time when the city’s top pizzerias were brooklyn stalwarts known less for showcasing top-tier products and more for following their own traditions. but the crowds came to una, paying $17 for the margherita. in 2009 times critic frank bruni called the cherry tomato pizza the city’s best — less than two weeks before una 2.0 unexpectedly served its final pies. mangieri was moving una again, this time to san francisco. his priest performed mass at the restaurant on opening night. he initially charged $20 for his creations, eventually upping the price to $25. when he closed it last year to move back to new york, local food writers penned eulogies whose tones suggested the premature death of a beloved humanitarian.it’s hard to think of any extant pizzaiolo, other than chris bianco, who has been the subject of such critical praise over the past two decades. and it’s almost impossible to think of a single other american chef who, instead of building a small empire, has chosen to live the life of a solo craftsman, closing his successful restaurants whenever he moves. this is what brings us to the lower east side, where mangieri has partnered with chefs and restaurateurs fabian von hauske and jeremiah stone to open una 4.0. it’s with a nod toward statistical probability, rather than cynicism, that one supposes it might not last forever. and it’s with a nod toward reality that one realizes his pies aren’t as good as they should be, not at $25 apiece, and not in the crowded, experimental, ingredient-obsessed, regionally focused pizza biosphere that is contemporary new york.una’s new digs suggest a futuristic diner crossed with a place of worship. there are stark white walls, black floor tiles, bare brown tabletops, emerald green chairs that fall over easily if you lean back, gray screens arranged in mondrian-like patterns, and a pizza oven spitting fire from behind a glass partition. how sepulchral. mangieri stands behind that partition, making pies. patrons watch as he molds the dough, applies the toppings, and pours olive oil from a copper cruet. he uses a metal peel to methodically rotate the pies in his oven, momentarily lifting them (to even out the cooking) before extricating them from the flames. his movements are efficient, elegant, hypnotic. and his bread is without equal among the city’s neapolitan spots. the pie’s outer rim is as fluffy as a fresh doughnut, releasing steam when torn. the crust is only gently blistered, with a subtle sourdough tang. it’s the stuff mangieri puts on top of that pie — subpar imported mozzarella, too much parsley, uneven salt — that often make the main event a letdown, however. such an oversight would’ve been a problem of critical proportions under any other variant of una, where only the only items up for grabs were mangieri’s four or five pies, plus beer or wine.but una 4.0 spreads its risk, boasting a slightly longer menu that bookends the baking with starters and sweets. if one were to rank things, the chief reasons to visit are, in this order: the ice cream, the tiramisu, the small plates, the natural wines, the three tomato pizza, the marinara pie, the cherry tomato pie, the air conditioning, and then the margherita, which you can quite frankly skip. this lower east side spot, in other words, generally functions better as a modern von hauske and stone restaurant than a classically minded mangieri joint. ice cream is among the chief summertime draws of any tristate pizza parlor, and so it’s worth noting that von hauske’s are among the city’s most electric. for the plain vanilla variety, he laces the dessert with a sucker punch of sodium, leaving an aftertaste that recalls the salty milk at the bottom of a bowl of corn flakes. for pistachio, he uses a turkish paste that balances the product’s deep nuttiness with its heady perfume. and for all his ice creams, he builds his bases without egg, spinning equal parts cream and milk from five acre farms, resulting in a dairy drop kick so concentrated it almost tastes malted. one wouldn’t be faulted for dropping by una for just for dessert — any dessert. von hauske brings life to the tired staple that is panna cotta by decorating it like a birthday cake, garnishing the outer rim with a fragrant ring of strawberries that have been sliced, whipped, and juiced. he also serves a rum- and cynar-laced tiramisu, dense with ladyfingers and mascarpone, in a chalice, giving this kingly and complex confection the regal serving device it deserves. starters, compliments of stone, are equally destination-worthy, even if they’re more in loose conversation with the concept of a pizzeria than a kowtow to the form. the chef cuts raw filet mignon into thick strips and showers them in olives, pistachios, and a carbonara’s worth of parmesan. he uses ceci not in a chickpea salad, but rather to surround a circle of yuzukosho-spiked raw lobster, a wickedly delicious tartare. to channel pepperoni, he spreads spicy ’nduja sausage on a plate, topping it off with rounds of watery turnip and peppery nasturtium leaves; the effect evokes an edible version of wassily kandinsky’s abstract circles. some will find such appetizer experimentalism to be incongruous with traditional pizzas. i’d counter that it’s a valiant study in how refinement and rusticity, artistry and craft, deserve to coexist. why? because when i’m swigging back a honeyed tokaji or frothy lambrusco, the fact that these small plates seem to belong to a separate restaurant take a back seat to a more important reality: they’re delicious. if only mangieri’s pizzas — particularly the toppings — were as reliably delicious as those at razza, roberta’s, sullivan street, and so many other spots that charge $7-$12 less. una’s filetti pie, to be fair, is still impressive, with the gorgeously pulpy cherry tomatoes acting as foil to a pile of (not terribly milky) buffalo mozzarella. the margherita, somewhat creamy on certain nights, can suffer from curds as flavorless as polly-o string cheese on other evenings; mangieri occasionally uses cheese so low in moisture its tastes like saline rubber. his marinara pie is more smartly composed, with a layer of fragrant garlic and olive oil yielding to the gentle fragrance of san marzanos. the fruit doesn’t boast the compelling acidity or assertive aroma found in comparable pies around town; this is a more restrained study in the tomatoes’ complexity. sometimes this is maddening; you often need to close your eyes and concentrate to divine the nature of these tomatoes. and sometimes, for just a bite or two, it all comes together; the pulp mixes with a salt crystal, resulting in a concoction as aromatic as rose.then on another night the marinara is underseasoned. so you ask for salt. a waiter shakes his head. this decision, for a nanosecond, is understandable. one wouldn’t walk into an opera house and tell the soprano to sing louder — but there’s something to be said for using a hearing aid. for some, salt is that hearing aid for flavor. even at the city’s most expensive sushi parlors, chefs often give diners a tiny ramekin of shoyu, just in case. it’s a nice act of humility, and a comparable gesture at una would go a long way given that dinner for one (a starter, a pizza, a dessert, two drinks) can run nearly $100 after tax and tip. the right move is to swing by on fridays for the new “concetta” pizza. mangieri blends house-made tomato paste, roasted tomatoes, crushed san marzanos, and pecorino. it’s an epic ode to the classic new york-style tomato pie. the flavors and textures are alternatingly jammy, tart, sugary, pulpy, umami-rich, and floral — at least that’s the case if you pick off the forest canopy’s worth of parsley, an herb whose bitterness overwhelms the tomato’s subtleties.pizza-making is tough, manual labor. diners who click on the “about” section of una’s website will encounter an article about mangieri discussing the mental stress of the job and the toll of inhaling flour and smoke. for these sacrifices we should all be paying more. but it would help mangieri’s case for higher prices if he were making better pizza.cost: starters at $9-$20; pizzas at $25; desserts at $7-$9. expect to spend about $100 per person on dinner after tax and tip for a full three-course meal with drinks.sample dishes: raw beef with olives and pistachios, raw lobster with yuzukosho and chickpeas, ’nduja with turnip and nasturtium, margherita pizza, marinara pizza, three-tomato pizza, cherry tomato pizza, tiramisu, panna cotta, pistachio ice cream.bonus tip: the chief reasons to come here are the small plates, the desserts, and the natural wines. for pizza, friday is your best bet for the three-tomato pie.empire builder kihyun lee’s rustic-chic midtown restaurant is innovative and artfulthe art project of a menu at her name is han, at 28 pages, runs longer than most wine lists. the binder-bound tome opens to photos of of soju bathed in soft light. pink grapefruit segments and candied cherry blossoms bob in the distilled spirit, a harbinger of the boozy night that will ensue. on another page, a shrimp and hot-pepper pancake is shot from overhead, an angle that flattens the jeon’s intensely briny and spicy nooks and crannies, almost giving it the illusion of being stenciled on its blue-and-white plate. all of the pages are matte, printed on heavy, high-quality paper, with the dishes and descriptions scattered about in a loose, magazine-style layout. some items receive museum style-captions; there are short history lessons on the origins of gochugaru spice paste and army stews. fanned-out slices of pig belly are advertised in all-caps fonts that would be fit for a wartime billboard. “han’s pork will fatten your soul!” none of this feels like a standard bill of fare as much as a gift guide from a high-end retailer. owner kihyun lee, who studied at the fashion institute of technology, is leveraging the power of print and design to transform the restaurant’s rustic korean dishes into objects of edible desire.or put more practically, the menu’s clever photography acts as an unspoken guide to why certain dishes are so spectacular. consider the bulgogi. the camera gets in close on the minced short-rib patty, the surface glistening with moisture, the craggy edges burnished from the grill. i daydreamed about the gorgeous char before it arrived — and when it did, on a scorching cast-iron pan, the bulgogi turned out to be perfectly seared, crunchy, and packed with notes of sugar, sesame, and soy. when i close my eyes and picture it, what i see first is the photo. as certain stretches of the city continue to suffer from strains of gastronomic ennui (“oh boy, another new american hotel restaurant”), the ascendency of modern korean fare has become one of the more energizing trends in new york, from the tasting-menu-only jungsik to the experimental small plates of oiji to the ramyun wonders of jeju to the bovine barbecue bombshell that is cote. lee himself helped fuel this zeitgeist with take 31, which hawks havana-style corn cakes, radish kimchi jambalaya, and banana-flavored rice beer (his hospitality company, hand, also collaborates with the sleek korean atoboy).the more classical han doesn’t so much represent a refutation of this trend as a stylish counterpoint to it. the nearly three-year-old venue, next door to take 31, elicits most of its thrills via more traditional means: homestyle shared plates, stews, and one of the city’s better fried chickens. this is all contrasted, gently, by that ethan allen catalogue of a menu, as well as the the requisite brick walls, neon signage, exposed filament light bulbs, antlers, and bric-a-brac on bookshelves. then again, it is unlikely that notions of modernity, tradition, the color of the walls, or even the name of your dining companions will register as important data points when the fiery blue crab is wreaking havoc on your face, your tongue, your mucous membranes. chef namhyung woo cuts up raw crab and douses it in enough garnet spice paste to make the crustacean look like a drippy christmas ornament. the best way to eat the staple dish, called yangnyeom gejang, is however the heck you can, but this critic advises slurping the grey, slippery meat out of the shell and enjoying the gentle brininess before the full heat assault takes over (tamer types can scoop out the meat with a spoon). pair the crab with cooling tofu. han drenches the bean curd in so much black sesame seed sauce that it takes on the look of vanilla bean-speckled gelato. on top of this largesse goes a fistful of crisply battered onions. the flavors are simple and accessible: soft tofu, nutty milk, salty fried allium. on its own, it’s a solid-sized snack (or a light meal) for $9. every dinner, of course, is accompanied by the traditional banchan, ramekin-sized side dishes that change on a daily basis, from cabbage kimchi to salted asparagus, umami-rich tangles of dried seaweed, and chewy little piles of dried, chile-flecked squid.han’s menu bills its offerings as “korean soul food,” stating that the venue is geared toward the “growing number of korean americans and korean internationals working and studying in the city.” indeed, the greater metropolitan area is home to the country’s second-largest community of korean americans in the country after los angeles. and while many of the more modern spots are dispersed throughout tribeca, the east village, flatiron, and elsewhere, lee keeps his small empire closer to manhattan’s koreatown on 32nd street, where venues are often open 24 hours to cope with sky-high rents. han closes at 11:15 p.m. on weekends, which is a bit of a letdown for those craving its superb fried chicken. it might not reach the level of perfection of, say, turntable jazz (one of the city’s best, open until midnight on the weekends), but it beats out virtually any recent entry this critic can think of. the bird lacks any of the garlic or chile sauces so frequently associated with korean-style fries. it’s just plain fried chicken that’s sufficiently juicy, crispy, and brined, with a touch of sweetness, and a wallop of concentrated poultry flavor. the kitchen cuts it into knobs that can be picked up with chopsticks; the meat is best when sprinkled with a touch of salt and dipped into sweet-and-sour sauce.the menu says that its rice cakes are laced with yuzu, but i couldn’t detect any of the fragrant citrus. they taste like any good rice cake: soft, glutinous, and slathered in chile sauce. also consider the steamed dumplings, filled with pork and cabbage, as well as the stretchy potato noodles, infused with soy and topped with sweet head-on shrimp.bo ssam, boiled pork belly with spicy kimchi, won’t win any converts with its middle-of-the-road preparation; others will find comfort in the soft textures and bland flavors of the pork.budae jjigae, which literally boils from the heat of a tableside flame, is a stunning rendition of the post-korean war stew, blending american ingredients like spam, canned beans, hot dogs, and processed yellow cheese (which fully dissolves within seconds) with rice cakes and kimchi-infused beef broth. it’s a study in succulent, umami-rich nitrites that will require the user to consume as much water as beer. the desserts boast a more contemporary bent. the kitchen places two scoops of black sesame ice cream over a green tea crumble and garnishes the affair with tart dried strawberries; the primary-color contrasts are striking — the dish looks like it was pulled out a cartoon sundae shop. even better is the deconstructed banana split: a bruleed sweet plantain, served alongside a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a spicy pool of caramel ginger. the dessert (and its plating) is decidedly modern, even if the rest of han is old-school, which, quite frankly, is a good balance for a restaurant — and occasionally, a city — to have.cost: small plates at $15 or less. larger share plates hover in the $20s, while even heftier budae jjigae stews run $33-$35. dinner for two shouldn’t cost more than $100 or so. lunch platters run $15-$19.\\xa0cash only at lunch.sample dishes: tofu with black sesame sauce, rice cakes with yuzu gochujang, stir-fried potato noodles with prawns, potato pancake with shrimps, fire-grilled bulgogi, fried chicken with pickled radishes, ginger caramel plantain with vanilla ice cream.bonus tip: do not sleep on the excellent house-infused sochu, especially the not-too-sweet grapefruit variety!einat admony’s charming west village restaurant looks like a fast-casual restaurant but tastes like a fine dining onewith its nuanced use of precious spices and inspired flavor combinations, moroccan cuisine is among the world’s tastiest. the country lies at the end of spice routes that span the sahara, with a mixed population of berbers and arabs, but one that also had a substantial sephardic jewish population during the pre-israel era. additionally, the country was colonized by spain and france. all these influences come into focus in a subtle and sometimes playful cuisine.this and other north african cuisines are the centerpiece of the menu at kish-kash, which concentrates solely on one dish: couscous. the new restaurant from chef einat admony, who was born in tel aviv and also operates balaboosta and taim, opened in june on a shady stretch of hudson street in the west village, between morton and barrow streets. two welcoming benches sit out front.inside, an airy modern interior is lined with geometric tiles in grayish and greenish shades, reflecting islamic design traditions, mixed with a certain swedish flair to the prim and nicely padded furniture. no reservations are taken for smaller parties, the tables are closely spaced, and an open kitchen lies at the end of the room. the bill of fare is short, offering only four apps, three sides, and six versions of couscous, plus specials. while the atmosphere and limited focus suggest a fast-casual joint, the excellence of the food shouts “fine dining.” in fact, kish-kash feels like a new sort of hybrid.few dishes this year have landed with such a bang as admony’s chicken tagine couscous. let’s look first at the couscous itself, presented on the side rather than underneath. in many moroccan restaurants, it arrives studded with lamb, chicken, and merguez, dubbed “royal couscous.” in truth, these couscouses are often dry as blown desert sand.at kish-kash, the chef and her minions endlessly fuss over it, steaming and re-steaming. despite the small size of the couscous she deploys — the couscous, which represents crushed durum wheat semolina, is available in dozens of diameters — the result is memorably moist, and not the least bit sloppy.the implement she uses is known as a kish-kash, which consists of a pair of pots, one poised over the other. with the brilliant couscous produced therein, the main courses fall into place. foremost is the aforementioned chicken tagine ($15), which pairs another famous moroccan dish, a stew often cooked in a clay vessel called a tagine, with the couscous. a plump bird is roasted with green olives, preserved lemons, and caramelized onions, producing a winning pungency with a citric edge.another spectacular couscous is mafrum, a recipe often attributed to libya that features a hollowed-out potato filled with spicy ground beef. the chef further tosses rankly potato sticks on top of the spud to add crunch. i could eat this spectacular comfort food every day. equally good is chraime ($19), a fish fillet in a limpid tomato sauce crowned with pepper. the dish is hot but not too hot.in the second tier of desirable couscous at kish-kash, but still well worth ordering, stand tbecha (short rib, on one occasion a bit tough), chunky lamb (simultaneously chewy and tender), and moroccan vegetables of the squash, carrot, and turnip sort, shotgunned with chickpeas. for once, the dish didn’t seem like a torture arranged for vegetarians, and i’d gladly order this again, especially considering the $12 price tag.speaking of vegetables, they totally rule the rest of the menu. there’s a great hummus ($9) flavored with chermoula, a green relish of chopped parsley and cilantro and presented with seeded challah bread, which arrives in a paper bag with the edges turned back. no cardboard pitas here. there’s also a cauliflower smothered in tahini, a brilliant salad featuring greens and sliced avocado in a lemony dressing, and deep fried eggplant.another charming aspect of the menu is the three sides, priced at $3 each: a crushed and brightly flavored orange squash, stewed tomatoes, and lemon-pickled vegetables. individually or in concert, they add extra zing to your plate of couscous.several things make kish-kash particularly appealing. one is the couscous itself, rendered more perfectly than in any other new york establishment; i’ve only tasted couscous this good in morocco. second, the limited menu encourages you to zone in on your favorite version of the dish and make it your regular order. alternately, if you happen to be there with a table of friends, it’s well within the realm of reason to order all the starters and all the sides to enjoy a sumptuous banquet.and with its small size, cheery demeanor, commendable service, and relatively low prices (one can dine well for $25), kish-kash feels like a new type of restaurant, hopefully spawning imitators who strike a similar note with different cuisines. a mexican restaurant concentrating on ceviche prepared with the precision of sushi, or a chinese cocktail bar concentrating on shanghai tapas? well, why not? let’s call it “slow casual.”cost: dinner for two, including an app, two couscouses, two side dishes, and two glasses of mint tea, plus tax but not tip, $70sample dishes: baladi eggplant with roasted red pepper tahini, shuk salad with avocado, mafrum (stuffed potato) couscous, chirchi mashed squashwhat to drink: nothing is more refreshing than the mint iced tea ($5), but the house sangria ($12) of fresh peaches and rosewater is also a good choice. apart from that, a short wine list, and a better selection of beer await your choice.bonus tip: one dessert is usually available. on a recent occasion, it was basbousa, a semolina cake with fresh berries. share it with the table.marie-aude rose’s first u.s. restaurant is gorgeous, buttery, and very priceyanyone who understands a cafe to be an informal hangout for nibbling and lingering — a “small restaurant where simple fare and drinks are served,” as the cambridge dictionary puts it — will be forgiven for strolling into la mercerie without a reservation or a lot of cash. the soho newcomer does, after all, claim to celebrate the “thoughtful delights of everyday french cooking.” but this particular cafe sits inside the roman and williams guild, a design emporium that sells the artisanal dinnerware patrons use during meal service. cards on every table advertise the lofty prices; a single earthenware teacup and saucer runs $125. and that nice ottoman just outside the dining room? it’s $10,000.an all-day place for an impromptu rendezvous with a colleague this is not — not with $32 white asparagus salads, and not with the lack of dedicated seating for walk-ins after 12 p.m. there are no bar stools. there is no takeout except for pastries and espresso. and virtually any lunchtime table can book a week out. if this sounds outrageous for a place that sells crepes and coffee, well, it kind of is. but at least there’s a good reason for the demand: marie-aude rose is the chef. she makes really good crepes. ambitious new york chefs don’t tend to iterate on that parisian street staple, nor do they tend to serve tuna-fish sandwiches for dinner like rose does. the prevailing resurgence of french food in manhattan has taken a variety of forms, from hip small plates spots with natural wines to haute-poultry purveyors to exalted tasting palaces. what distinguishes la mercerie — and what ranks it as one of the most compelling gallic spots of the past decade — is its unusual dedication to riffing on humble french-cafe fare.a waiter ferries over a white plate covered by a craggy grey dome. this is the grilled buckwheat crepe; it hides a soft pile of chicken cut with carrots (for sweetness), cream (for richness), and tarragon (for aroma). you use the earthy pancake, which is crisp like a dosa, to scoop up the meaty bits with your hands. it’s not so much a standard portable crepe as something that could hold its own at a michelin-starred establishment. or consider a single soft-boiled egg. rose places it atop cauliflower-tofu puree, speckles it with breadcrumbs, and anoints it with a few wisps of parmesan. the flavors express themselves with such breathtaking clarity — the vegetal punch of the chou-fleur, the opulence of the golden yolk, the umami-richness of the cheese — that one wonders why robuchon isn’t selling these at his slick chef’s counter. rose asks $15 for this masterpiece. la mercerie isn’t really an everyday cafe; it’s rather a nancy meyers-esque, upper-class fantasy of one. cue the plush aqua mohair banquettes, the $6 croissants (balthazar charges $3.75), the rustic linen napkins (take home four for $105), and the in-house florist peddling curvy myrtle topiaries.these frivolities notwithstanding, it’s a heck of a debut for rose. she’s a parisian chef who’s worked in the kitchens of guy savoy and pierre gagnaire, two of the world’s most celebrated practitioners of haute gastronomy, as well as that of daniel rose, a chicago-born culinarian famous for his dressed-down approach to fine dining at spring. daniel hired marie as spring’s first cook. the duo married and moved to new york in 2016 so daniel could open le coucou, an awesome (and expensive) ode to the grand french dining rooms of yesteryear. la mercerie, located a few blocks away from le coucou and run by the same operator, stephen starr, is cheaper and more casual by design — but no less technical or studied in its fare. there’s probably not a single tasting-menu venue in new york with a more comprehensive butter program.accompanying cantabric anchovies are butter sticks laden with as much vanilla as ice cream, acting as a gently sweet counterpart to the assertively saline fish. patrons spread sourdough slices with a lemon butter that’s as aromatic as sorbet, or a speckled buckwheat butter packing the aromas of an autumnal bonfire. but best of all is when the kitchen sends out icy kushi oysters with pats of seaweed butter. the bivalve is refreshingly cucumber-y, while the nori-spiked dairy, smeared on a rye cracker, amps up the umami factor with a more powerful burst of brine.fans of the trendier aspects of all-day dining, take note: there are no grain bowls, chia puddings, or bespoke-blend burgers here. in the morning, you come for crisp ham and cheese croissants; they smell richly of dairy, as much a product of the buttery laminated dough as the heady, 18-month-aged comté. in the afternoon, you come for a rare filet, doused in cognac sauce, and paired with tangy blue cheese pommes dauphine. and on a sweaty summer evening, you come for the salad nicoise, with a pile of slow-cooked tuna, green beans, and olives drenched in enough pungent anchovy vinaigrette to make the palate beg for champagne.if your table isn’t ready, hosts might suggest strolling back into the guild itself, where you can admire a soft reindeer pelt over a bespoke couch ($16,000) or negotiate the angles of a cubist chair that looks plucked from the set of beetlejuice ($30,000). there’s nothing uncommon about mixing restaurants and retail; bloomingdales, abc home, and other department stores have a long history of hosting culinary establishments. the reason for these mashups are as simple as a buffet in a vegas casino: to keep people inside and to keep them spending. but at la mercerie, where the cost of goods is so completely out of reach to so many, the restaurant rather takes on the air of an aspirational advertisement, a postcard from a fictional millionaire’s lifestyle. and in this regard, one has to ask whether starr, one of the country’s most successful independent restaurateurs, could’ve found a larger space for rose’s stunning cooking, rather than place her cafe in a store where a sofa costs more than a ford fiesta sedan.it would be nice to see more folks sample rose’s stellar boeuf bourguignon, a shimmering red-wine braise that sits over a pile of firm, buttered penne, or her epic roast chicken, deboned and with the skin as crunchy as the layers of mille-feuille. just when the salty bliss of the bird starts to shock the palate, something unusual resets it: garlic-ginger nougatine, discs of sugar-enriched allium that rose should sell by the bag as candy.one last note: if new york is having a bit of a pastry moment right now, la mercerie is sometimes a laggard in this regard. rose’s torteau fromager, a french cheesecake made from chevre, recalled an arid poundcake on a recent visit. profiteroles — pastry puffs filled with ice cream — had about as much flavor as matzoh and quickly took on a stiff texture. ananas and kirsch — pineapple slices doused in cherry brandy — evoked diced supermarket fruit doused in an indistinct spirit. then there’s rose’s orange-flower-water-laced brioche, which might be one of the sweets of the century. in the morning, she cuts a single generous slice into four oversized batons and stands them up in a bowl of creme anglaise. guests nibble and dunk as if these were toast soldiers, letting the eggy sauce fortify the obscenely rich bread. i’ve never encountered something so aromatically indulgent in a cafe, which is why it seems perfect in this whimsical, flawed, beautiful daydream of one.cost: starters at $9-$21; mains, salads, and crepes at $18-$37. expect to spend about $120 per person after tax and tip at dinner. an americano (la colombe, $5.50) and a croissant ($6) at the takeout counter will run about $13 after tax, which is a lot.sample dishes: ham and cheese croissant ($11), brioche with creme anglaise ($8), salad nicoise ($27), anchovies with vanilla butter ($21), oysters with seaweed butter (2 for $10), chicken with garlic-ginger nougatine ($33), filet with pommes dauphine ($37).bonus tip: la mercerie is walk-in only until noon. lunch tables can book up a week out or more, while evening bookings tend to fill up between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. outside of breakfast, walk-ins have the best luck between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. a few stools near the window allow for daytime pastry eating.the first international outpost of nepal chain bajeko sekuwa arrives with funky mutton and fatty wild boarnew yorkers are already familiar with a wealth of barbecue traditions — and their associated starches. eat jamaican jerk chicken at peppa’s and expect a sweet doughnut called festival. texas barbecues like hill country dole out slices of white supermarket bread, while in uzbek kebab joints like cheburechnaya, the parabolic cracker-thin flatbread noni toki will probably make an appearance. so you shouldn’t be shocked when your nepalese barbecue rolls in on a bed of puffed rice.located right on queens boulevard, the main drag of sunnyside, bajeko sekuwa (“grandfather’s barbecue”) is the first international branch of a restaurant originating in the mountainous republic of nepal, sandwiched between india and tibet. the chain traces its roots to a grilled meat shack that opened 38 years ago near the kathmandu airport. it attracted enthusiastic customers — according to the website — but also flocks of crows that proved such a nuisance to aviation that the shack had to be moved.dinanath bhandari founded the company that’s now run by his son chetan, a chain that currently comprises 13 restaurants in nepal, as well as our own orphan branch, where nepalese-born surendra rayamajhi is chef. the dining room sports a peaked ceiling, rustic wood rafters, and a lighting motif that suggests glowing village windows. a bar at the end dispenses cocktails, wine, and beer, while a native kitchen is mocked up by the front door. on top of the wood hearth a fosi (narrow-mouthed copper pot) and a karahi (wok-like cooking vessel) are perched.single item servings of barbecue known as sekuwas ($9.95 to $14.95) form the crux of the menu. as mentioned previously, these charcoal-grilled meats are served on puffed rice, which absorbs the grease and juices. they’re sided with a small undressed salad and a few pieces of root-vegetable achar (pickle). due to agricultural conditions and a nomadic past, vegetables remain limited in nepalese cuisine.your barbecue choices are confined to chicken, goat, hyakula (mutton), and bandel (wild boar). pick any of the last three. one of the most appealing features of bajeko sekuwa is that it presents meats that are underexposed here. yes, the mutton is as funky as you might wish, while the boar favors fatty belly meat, almost tasting like pig but not quite. (the menu also offers the same boar in steamed form with seasoned salt and a chile dip. skip it.) sadly, the actual nepalese barbecue part of bajeko sekuwa’s menu is small compared to the rest of the menu.the balance of the bill of fare falls into three categories, including distinctively nepalese dishes, indian-chinese offerings, and food from northern india. the latter includes tandoori selections that, i suppose, might be considered part of the restaurant’s barbecue mission. into this category fall pink and slightly charred tiger prawns, a delectable deal at $15.95 for seven. the usual tandoori chicken and its clay pit pals are also provided.bajeko sekuwa distinguishes itself from the dozen or so nepalese cafes in jackson heights and elmhurst by being more meat oriented. nevertheless, a handful of starchier dishes are available, which are the main focus of most himalayan menus in queens. these include the wonderful bhatmas sandheko ($5.95) — crunchy fried soybeans tossed with scallions, garlic, and lemon juice to make one of the world’s best bar snacks. and yes, there are momos like those that fly from carts near the jackson heights subway stop.momo fillings run to vegetables, chicken, and goat, and one should spring for the optional chile sauce that forms their perfect accompaniment. but even better is jhol momo ($7.95 to $11.95), which immerses the thick-skinned dumplings in a sesame soup something like tahini. it’s so good, you’ll lap up the remaining liquid. but the thukpa are a big disappointment. instead of the usual ragged homemade noodles, which look like they were torn by a cook in a hurry, this restaurant’s version seems like overcooked spaghetti.yes, bajeko sekuwa is a place where you should head for the unusual stuff. the bone soup ($5.95) is a delight, resembling the bone broth so newly popular in greenwich village, only loaded with goat pieces. “tauko fry” is a catalog of goat face parts that will leave you trying to distinguish ear, cheek, and lip. (the same assortment is less beguiling in its boiled form.) avoid the indian-chinese food. dishes like chow mein and fried rice are better at the local chinese carryout, so go for the gingery goat biryani ($13.95) instead.while the indian fare like palak paneer and chana masala make some the menu’s tastier vegetarian options, one is better off getting those things in one of the punjabi steam table joints that dot the neighborhood. although, come to think of it, the best thing on the menu, in addition to the barbecue on puffed rice, is an indian regional dish.utilizing a creative spelling, bengoli fish curry ($14.95) originates in the bengal region of india and bangladesh, a stunning mince of freshwater fish in a supremely creamy sauce of mustard oil, onions, and tomatoes. and that mustard oil — a signal ingredient in nepalese cooking — leaves an enjoyable tingle in your throat with every swallow.cost: dinner for two, including fried soybeans, bengoli fish curry, and goat sekuwa, plus two beers, including tax but not tip, $50sample dishes: chireko salad (carrot, daikon, and cucumber crudité), chicken biryani, haas ko choila (chargilled duck), and hyakula sekuwa (mutton barbecue)what to drink: european or american beers (selection varies, sometimes there is singaporean tiger beer), mango lassi, or plain tap waterbonus tips: you may be tempted to use this place as an indian restaurant, since the renditions of punjabi dishes and tandoori meats and vegetables are up to par. but eating the specifically nepalese stuff is more rewarding. the restaurant is particularly adept at entertaining offal lovers and big groups.in brooklyn, two west indian restaurants are cementing their statuses as new york meat destinationsyou will wait at peppa’s jerk chicken. this is not a criticism of the capable staffers, who briskly take orders, wrap festival fry bread in wax paper, rag on one another, speak in calm voices to customers who spew expletives about the wait (wasn’t me), strategically turn chicken thighs on the fire-spitting grills, and hack the finished birds with a shiny meat cleaver, all with an easygoing efficiency. the wait is a product of a simpler fact. people like the chicken at this crown heights counter-service spot. lots of people. so you wait too. you listen to the reggae-tinged playlist. you place your order. and you snag one of two tables outside or one of six seats seats inside. five to 15 minutes later, a counter worker presents you with an aluminum container filled with haphazardly chopped poultry parts. you squeeze scotch bonnet sauce all over the steaming poultry, which smells of smoke and ashen fat. you crack open a coke. and you start to devour a bird whose charred exterior and bracing capsaicin buzz make it, without question, one of the city’s finest chickens.the cost for a small order is just $6.island culture is new york culture. and if there’s any doubt about that, consider the following: nearly 2 million people are expected to attend this weekend’s labor day parade in crown heights, an annual west indian celebration of such epic proportions it earned a line in jay-z’s anthemic empire state of mind. one in five foreign-born new yorkers hails from the non-hispanic caribbean, which explains why the city packs such an ample supply of trinidadian roti, haitian griot, and belizean curried shrimp. jerk in particular thrives along nostrand and flatbush avenues in brooklyn — the heart of the city’s west indian community. the culinary style traces its mouth-stinging lineage to jamaica; it developed in the 1700s as a fusion between the pit-cooking techniques of escaped west african slaves and the native taino spice rubs designed to prevent meat spoilage. the question of exactly what jerk is in the 21st century, however, has become “open for interpretation,” island & spice editor rochelle oliver wrote for the times in july. “is it a flavor? is it the ingredients? is it the way the meat is cooked? the truth lies somewhere in the middle,” she argued. in jamaica, jerk typically involves seasoning whole hogs or chicken with a pungent mix of ingredients that grow in the island nation’s verdant interior: scallions, thyme, allspice, and chiles. the meats are then slowly smoked over resinous pimento branches, either underground or in a steel drum. in new york, this is the style loosely employed by lolo’s in harlem and glady’s in crown heights and, as of this spring, in prospect-lefferts — more on that later enterprise in a bit.cooking with hardwood fuel, alas, requires expensive ventilation systems and emissions filters. that means jerking in the city often means forgoing the smoker in favor of a gas grill or oven. miss lily’s in manhattan, which sells a bird that tastes like any backyard chicken, is an example of how to do this new york style of jerking poorly. peppa’s is an example of how to do it expertly.kingston-born gavin hussey is the person to thank here. he opened the first peppa’s just south of prospect park in 2004 and has since expanded the business with his brother jason and his daughter jessica, who share ownership. a crown heights location opened in 2016, followed by a peppa’s near brownsville later that year. the hussey family is striking while the iron is hot; fast-casual chicken concepts are proliferating, from david chang’s fuku to seamus mullen’s whirlybird to the poultry-centric made nice. peppa’s is better. the crown heights location, the subject of this inquiry, is the only one with seating. and like all the other locations, there are a few non-chicken items, including a pile of goat curry, gorgeously funky with gelatinous meat and thick gravy and a sweet stewed oxtail over coconut rice.but really, you’ve come here for the chicken. the meat is scored, washed in vinegar, marinated overnight in a rub whose ingredients no one would reveal to me, and grilled for approximately 45 minutes. certain bites pack a clean poultry tang; others are earthy and woodsy from the flames. the skin comes off with ease, yielding to a gentle chew like a charred campfire marshmallow. the hot sauce causes your tongue to tingle or five minutes afterwards, maybe six. you dampen the heat with a forkful of coconut rice, or a sweet, craggy festival — essentially sweet, fried cornbread. the near-perfect jerk here is the type of preparation that calls into question spending $60 on a chicken for two at a passable brasserie, or $10 on the bland, overcooked birds at whole foods. peppa’s is a chain worth rooting for.strolling by the sophomore location of glady’s, on the corner of lincoln road and rogers avenue, means inhaling the heady aroma of smoldering wood. that scent is chef junior felix’s beacon. for nearly half a decade, michael jacober, a rhode island native not of west indian descent, has been the unlikely public face of the popular caribbean restaurant. but with the opening of the prospect-lefferts outpost this spring, jacober has stepped back, letting the chef, a native st. lucian who’s been involved in virtually every recipe glady’s has ever developed, oversee the space as a co-owner. felix ensures that anything carrying the name jerk is jerked the classic way: via a sauna of fragrant smoke. he prepares all the meats over a custom smoker that sits behind the counter, a rectangular steel edifice built by a guy called alabama joe. he cooks pork and chicken at 275 degrees for about 2.5 hours — hotter and faster than most american ’cue. the wood selection, in turn, departs a bit from jamaican traditions. felix uses a mix of domestic maple and ash, alongside traditional pimento chips, which impart a flavor that some liken to bay leaves.the jerk, sweet and vaguely piney with expertly rendered fats, calibrated heat, and bracing pungency, is so good that glady’s is as much in conversation with peppa’s as it is with a place like hometown or mighty quinn’s. the comparison is important. there’s long been a tendency to overcategorize affordable or unfamiliar foodstuffs, to relegate them to a series of polite “best of brackets” rather than to critique them within the larger context of the city’s dining traditions. and so in the case of glady’s, its place within the jerk community is just one story; the bigger picture is that it’s one of the the city’s most accomplished barbecue restaurants. and felix is without question one of new york’s top pitmasters.warning: the prospect-lefferts sequel doesn’t have the same frenetic, the-waitlist-is-full, everyone’s-cramped-together-jerk-eating energy as the original location. the space here is larger and emptier. there is no wait and there are no waiters; the new glady’s is counter-service only. and the design ethos is technicolor eclectic with wood-paneled benches, cushy teal banquettes, crimson flooring, orange pressed-tin walls, outdoor picnic tables, and church-like stained glass windows. my prediction is that the crowds will pick up for a very basic reason: the food is better here than at the original. glady’s 1.0 cooks with a combi-oven, an expensive device that lets felix bombard his meats with wet heat, dry heat, and the pleasant fumes of wood chips. the proper smoker at glady’s 2.0, by contrast, makes a noticeable difference, imbuing the chicken ($9.50) with a deeper mahogany hue. that exterior is wonderfully leathery, a toothsome counterpart to the soft meat. the flavor is all sweet smoke at first — the poultry flavor isn’t as assertive as at peppa’s — followed by the clove-like warmth of the allspice berry and then bucking heat of the scotch bonnet. the tongue vibrates in such a way that recalls good sichuan fare.you quell the pain with a pinata, a bracingly tart slush of mezcal, grapefruit, and lime, or a kid kreyol, a perfumed blend of haitian rums, lime, honey and guava. shannon mustipher is the mind behind these creations; she’s one of the rare restaurant bartenders who can put together a list of drinks that’s simultaneously original, well-balanced, and food-friendly. the painkiller ($10), that classic mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, and nutmeg, is somewhat sugary on its own, and rightly so. it counters the aggressive salting and sharp aromas of felix’s jerk pork ($9.50). on some nights the swine’s fats are pleasantly chewy; on other nights they’re softer and more rendered, with a flesh that evokes tender jerky. guyanese chow mein — ramen tossed in soy and sesame — is a good way to keep from overloading on the luscious proteins, even if it omits the traditional egg noodles. for flavors that are lighter on both salt and smoke, the goat curry serves as a study in using coconut milk to convey the musky flavors of the ruminant and the gentle heat of habanero. jacober tells me he’ll soon start exporting the jerk center meats to the flagship, but for now, the prospect-lefferts location is the glady’s to visit. may there be more caribbean restaurants.cost: nothing over $13. small lunch orders are $6. dinner for two should cost no more than $20-$25. there is no alcohol, and no line for tipping on the credit card receipt.sample dishes: jerk chicken ($6-$13), curry goat ($9), oxtail ($12), festivals ($2).bonus tip: the beverage selection is not wide here; consider swinging by gloria’s beforehand, just down the block, for a cup of its excellent peanut punch.cost: a full dinner for two, including two meats, two sides, two cocktails, tax, and 20 percent tip (optional at a counter-service spot, but one of the suggested options on the payment screen), will run about $80. sample dishes: jerk chicken ($9.50), jerk pork ($9.50), curry goat ($12.50), guyanese chow mein ($12.50), peppered shrimp ($12.50), festivals ($3.50), spicy slaw ($3.50).funky food, natural wine, and warm service delight at riad nasr and lee hanson’s\\xa0deservedly packed restaurantat frenchette, riad nasr and lee hanson’s sleek tribeca hotspot, something unusual happens while patrons engage in the dreaded ritual of waiting for seats at a packed bar: a server walks up, presents a menu, and takes your drink order on the spot. no credit cards are requisitioned. no one behind the bar is summoned. and a few minutes later a waiter returns with, say, a calvados and tonic — a bitter, boozy, apple-tinged highball — or a fizzy glass of sparkling gamay. the quiet courtesy lets guests focus on what’s important, which is contemplating the list of natural wines or the menu of creative gallic fare — uni deviled eggs, anyone? — rather than forcing them to flag down a bartender or shout past fellow patrons. it’s the type of generosity that makes one think: maybe frenchette is worth the hour-long wait.“bad food is always more tolerable than bad service.” that’s one of the axioms of hospitality industry thinking, as well as a brilliant explainer as to why your grandparents’ burnt meatloaf always manages to please: because it’s served with love! and the good news is that service, in the mechanical sense of getting stuff to a table in a timely fashion, is generally practiced at a high level throughout the city. but a larger goal of hospitality — making guests feel warm and welcome in an unfamiliar environment where they’ll spend a lot of money — is a trickier affair. nasr and hanson are more skilled than the overseers at other fashionable hangouts at creating a sense of belonging, a heck of a thing given that the duo hail from minetta tavern, a keith mcnally restaurant whose earliest days were a classic example of how not to treat humans.frenchette’s cocktail service is part of the feel-good equation. another part is that the hosts seem genuinely excited to see guests at the door. and then there’s the fact that walk-ins aren’t just encouraged, they get about a third of the restaurant’s 105 seats; there are few better ways to make a first-time patron feel excluded than by telling them a nominally approachable cafe or brunch spot books up weeks out.hospitality is vital anywhere, but particularly clutch here, as it creates a safety net for a style of gastronomy that’s sometimes a standard deviation removed from the brasserie norm. instead of shrimp cocktail, the kitchen sends out warm spot prawns tossed in thyme and butter; guests are instructed to eat the entire crustacean, chomping through a shell that shatters like the crisp exterior of a kouign amann. and scrambled eggs, as rich as creme anglaise, come topped not with truffles but a tiny pile of sautéed snails, amping up the buttery fats and adding an umami-studded chew. these are the types of dishes that make it tough to be dismissive of frenchette, that make it hard to ask whether “we need another self-consciously luxurious brasserie, in a city so full of them,” as another critic wrote. the truth is that nasr and hanson have given new york something decidedly different. they’ve built a modern french spot in conversation with the ambitiously lean neo-bistros of paris, a venue whose culinary exploits can feel closer to a creative small plates place than a more staid institution like balthazar.yes, the dining room is a study in architectural riches, with red leather banquettes, white curtains, glossy sapele wood paneling, and sinuous liquor shelves that recall the space age curves of the 1960s. but in a city admittedly replete with brasseries, i can’t think of a single one dishing out ethereal fritters laced with smoked eel, or funky surf and turfs that pair oily mackerel with paper-thin veal tongue.how many other french restaurants are grilling blowfish tails, dousing them in chile butter and letting the patrons gnaw the succulent flesh off the bone? they are the chicken wings of the sea. and they go perfectly with a glass of pet-nat, a class of wines whose bubbles are produced without the addition of yeast or sugar, as is the case with the methode traditionelle. the result is a low-ish alcohol content and a level of fizz gentler than most champagnes.jorge riera, late of wildair, is the man behind the natural wine list, and a large reason why frenchette is compelling as it is. the bearded beverage director roams the dining room, deciphering obscure grapes to willing imbibers, and pouring restrained reds, skin contact orange wines, and cloudy whites that sometimes boast the oxidized flavor of sherry. but what makes the wines truly special is something larger: the ever-changing selections end up forcing a more honest conversation between the guest and the waiter or sommelier.if minetta rose to fame as one of the city’s more expensive purveyors of dry-aged steaks and hamburgers, frenchette seems destined to be a touch more accessible, with two of the signature red meat preparations offered at $34. the first and best is the duck frites; the kitchen takes the canard breasts and steams them, roasts them in a cage, and then crisps them up a second time on pickup. the silky fats and iron-y flesh are a welcome alternative to the working class indulgence that is steak frites, though frenchette does a fine number on that staple as well. the chefs rotate among a series of cuts, from bavette, to onglet, to the petit tender. the last of the bunch, also known as teres major, sports the soft mouthfeel of a filet but exhibits a more robust beefiness. the sun-drenched flavors of the cote d’azur is a running theme here, which explains the fish soup — a tomato-laced misfire packing as little flavor as campbell’s manhattan clam chowder. lemon- and bottarga-slicked spaghetti is a more skillful evocation of the mediterranean, with the fragrant citrus taming the mineral overtones of the cured roe. lamb, in turn, is broken down into the standard provencal daube-style stew; cubes of fork tender shoulder meat sit in a summery broth of red wine and lamb jus. rotisserie lobster smacks of clean ocean air; the soft meat drips with curried butter. and the $68 sasso chicken for two easily feeds three. it’s a thanksgiving feast of a dish, with golden skin as crispy as a hard taco shell, a crock of mushroom-spiked pommes puree redolent with the scent of maitakes, a baguette showered in tart vinegar, and a metal gravy boat filled with heady drippings. and while such carnivorous fare almost begs for a lighter dessert — there’s a fresh, sugary strawberry pavlova on the menu — pastry chef michelle palazzo excels in heartier endeavors. cue the stunning paris brest, filled with enough verdant pistachio cream to qualify as a nut butter sandwich. or consider the large format clafoutis, a wonderfully eggy cake studded with the namesake dark stone fruits.it’s also tempting to keep eating that chicken in the hours following a meal at frenchette. on a recent visit, the kitchen supplemented my leftovers with half a loaf of bread for postprandial sandwiches. the restaurant tells me this courtesy is only an occasional one, but i hope it becomes more regular. in an era where the price of dinner continues to shoot up, guests at expensively casual venues could use a nice parting gift from time to time.cost: amuses at $8 each; starters at $16-$24; mains at $24-$38, large format dishes at $68 (whole chicken), and $112 (cote de boeuf).sample dishes: smoked eel fritters, sea urchin deviled eggs, blowfish tails a la diable, fluke tartare, razor clams casino, duck frites, lobster with curry butter, petit tender with fries, chicken for two, rotisserie lobster with curry butter, paris-brest, cherry clafoutis.bonus tip: don’t sleep on the excellent sides, from the charred carrots with labneh and za’atar, to the gnocchi parisienne — pate a choux dumplings laced with enough comte to count as a cheese course.the sky-high french restaurant is a gift for its stunning views and accessible price point, though the food is less memorableright before the end credits of sam raimi’s spider-man (2002), superhero journalist peter parker swings through a sun-drenched manhattan as if it were a schoolyard jungle gym. viewers watch from up close as spidey hurdles himself past a cluster of midtown high-rises, an exuberant perspective that exaggerates the city’s sumptuous vertical topography. that bit of fiction is one of the first things that came to mind while dining at manhatta, danny meyer’s new french spot in the financial district; the 60th floor digs afford such intimate views of neighboring towers that the effect is like a comic. everything is larger than life.an elevator slingshots diners skyward. thirty seconds later, they’re nearly 800 feet above street level, gazing down upon the east river and its graceful bridges. manhatta’s dim lighting and neutral browns (think: wood-paneled floors, walnut-hued tables, and leather sofas) speak to a simple design ethos: don’t distract from the view. giant windows provide an imax-style panorama, framing the quartz-like asymmetries of hudson yards, the polychrome of the empire state, and the jenga-like stacking of 56 leonard — just a hang-glider ride away in tribeca.patrons who head to the main room for, say, lobster quenelles — the bulky crustacean transformed into ethereal fluff — will encounter another treat: the art deco 70 pine. the building’s lithe spire looms so large it’s like dining near a depression-era fantasy of a spaceship. and if that’s still not vivid enough, kindly put down your champagne and pick up that pair of binoculars on the windowsill. you can see families watching monday night football in the chic frank gehry building across the way.new york feels bigger, grander, and more alive at manhatta, with the surrounding buildings in conversation rather than in competition with one another. it’s a welcome contrast to our increasingly sterile billionaire’s metropolis, where eight-figure dwellings and exorbitant observation decks rise so high that everything below appears tinier and flatter, more like a google earth satellite image than the richly textured city we know.the price is right here too. in the smattering of manhattan bars and restaurants with serious views, admission comes with an elevation upcharge; one thinks of the $25 cocktails at the aviary, or the upper floors at one world trade, where the entrance fees can top out at $130 for two — before food. meyer, by contrast, keeps things a bit more reasonable; he asks $78, service included, for three courses. gourmands could easily spend more on a ground-level meal in midtown. for restaurants at altitude, manhatta might be the city’s best deal. and while the dining room books up a solid month in advance, the chef’s counter and a la carte bar, which boast some of the best sightlines here, are reserved for walk-ins. one can simply swing by the south lounge for a daiquiri at sunset, watching the sky turn pink over the turquoise dome of 40 wall street — a neo-gothic gem from the 1930s — while the statue of liberty shines below in the harbor. it’s a view you won’t find anywhere else in the city, and it’s a calming prelude to snacks at the counter, perhaps an order of croque-madames, a trio of deliciously messy mini-toasts stacked with ham, quail egg, and bechamel, for just $10. there are also tempura scallops on par with the catering operations at a good wedding hall.manhatta’s cooking, courtesy of gramercy tavern and per se vet jason pfeifer, sometimes does such an efficient job at not competing with the vistas that you practically forget what you’re eating halfway through a given course. a crimson puck of tarragon-laced tuna tartare, next to a few pretty lettuce leaves, serves as an inoffensive protein delivery mechanism, dissolving on the tongue without much heat or acidity. it is simply food. cavatelli, in turn, is virtually indistinguishable from other generic pasta dishes around the city; it’s a ho-hum melange of tomato, sauce, and pecorino. it is plain nourishment. the token vegetarian option, zucchini and squash roulade, is best described as cooked vegetables on a plate.pfeifer’s generic approach to french-leaning cuisine is what one wishes first-class airline fare always tasted like, which is to say vaguely fancy and well executed. you work your way through a roasted halibut over beans — a touch overcooked, but not dreadfully so — or pan-seared sweetbreads in a creamy blanquette sauce, the organ meats as silky and soft as fresh mozzarella. and then you continue on with your ogling of the cityscape. in one regard, such a setup is thoughtful; no one wants anything requiring a tableside “here’s how to eat this” speech while soaking up a once-in-a-lifetime vista. but in another sense, there’s something decidedly stodgy about the implicit premise of manhatta, which is that diners up high almost exclusively want another safe breed of continental-american fare, another serving of flaky turbot with brown butter and capers. it’s an assumption that has governed the “dinner with a view” class for venues for decades, from the old windows on the world to the rainbow room to the current offerings at one world trade. and barring a people’s revolution, it’s an assumption that will likely inform the upcoming rooftop offerings at 70 pine and 15 hudson yards.one wonders: as observatories, by their nature, attract some of the city’s most international crowds, should they not diversify their offerings just a bit? shouldn’t these tourist-drawing venues act as diplomats to the city’s multitudinous culinary offerings below? alas, until that happens, pfeifer does an impressive enough job with wagyu bavette steak, cross-hatching the top layer of beef to act as a sponge for a rich beef jus. he delivers a very good duck a l’orange, expertly rendering out the fats in the gently gamy breast. and he has a near work of art with his foie gras, a geometrically precise terrine over a layer of barely chewy tete de veau. it is a sweet-salty candy bar like few others. the meal winds down with desserts, perhaps a competent vanilla souffle or a requisitely sticky date cake. if this were an a la carte menu, you’d probably skip these sweets, but it’s not worth complaining much here; the prix fixe means spending a bit more time overlooking nocturnal manhattan in its luminescent glory. and while the city doesn’t suffer from any shortage of good gallic food, meyer’s ability to make this space unusually accessible is a true gift to new york.cost: $78 for three courses in the main dining room or at the bar. a la carte is also available in the bar room, with most small plates under $20. a french onion soup burger is $28. all prices are service included — no tipping.sample dishes: lobster quenelle with trumpet mushrooms, foie gras with tete de veau, duck a l’orange, wagyu bavette, warm date cake, vanilla souffle.bonus tip: if you go as a walk-in (which is likely, given how far in advance tables book up), try calling ahead to get a sense of the wait, or consider checking the social-media feeds to see if manhatta is closed for a private event, which seems to be the case more frequently than at other establishments.trigg brown and josh ku’s east williamsburg restaurant earns two stars for inventive versions of classicsone of the most important things to know about win son, a thrilling taiwanese-american hotspot in brooklyn, is that the “nutritious sandwich” is actually a doughnut sandwich.in taiwan’s keelung night market, stall workers stuff fried dough with chunks of sausage, tomatoes, and kewpie mayo. here in east williamsburg, win son reinterprets the classic by placing a butter-grilled shrimp patty between two halves of a grease-slicked miantuan bun.the kitchen tops the patty with pickled pineapple. the result is a masterful creation whose marked sugars, fruity acidity, and squishy bread lean toward the pastry world, but whose oceanic aromas keep it planted in the savory world. all it needs is a spoon of chile oil (on every table) and a cooling chiña colada cocktail, a verdant mix of rum, cilantro, basil, and coconut. the creamy drink cleanses the palate of any lingering salts — and amps up the sweetness just one or two more notches. win son is where you should be eating now. the kickstarter-funded restaurant opened in may 2016, thanks to the efforts of josh ku, a former property manager from queens, and trigg brown, a chef who worked at upland and craft. the duo met at a barbecue in bed-stuy; bonded over taiwan’s creative, protean food culture; traveled to tainan city for research; and eventually settled on the corner of montrose and graham.the basic rectangle of a space was, and still is, bare bones: creaky wood floors, exposed brick walls, black chairs, blonde wood tables, and a concrete bar. the soundtrack is hip-hop. the only kitsch is a trio of recycled soda-bottle chandeliers that gently glow red; the only artwork is a mural of folks eating at a communal table, a modern penal device that win son thankfully lacks. win son is just an unassuming neighborhood spot that happens to serve some of the city’s most ambitious taiwanese fare. table waits can easily hit two hours, the product of a booking system that only takes reservations for five or more. the smart move is to snag a few seats at the bar and order an omelet. soft eggs are folded around mild beausoleil oysters and a thick layer of sweet-potato starch, a traditional addition that adds stretchiness the way packaged shredded cheese would in an american diner omelet. the correct match for all the muted, silky flavors is the breakfast of champions, a restrained blend of rum, peanut milk, black sesame, and toasted coconut shavings. it is a cocktail, yes, but it also recalls the globally popular milk teas (sometimes studded with tapioca balls) for which taiwan is famous.any cuisine in a globalizing world can be difficult to define; what makes the food of taiwan so fascinatingly complex is that the island nation has seen its diverse gastronomy fueled by a long history of immigration. it derives many of its influences from china’s neighboring fujian and guangzhou provinces, but it also incorporates foods from the japanese occupation in the 20th century, the hakka diaspora, indigenous peoples, and an influx of refugees from all corners of china following the civil war that ended in 1950.one of taiwan’s modern classics, spicy popcorn chicken, became popular in the late 1970s as an easier-to-eat analog to the bone-in variety, hawked by local kfc outposts. win son’s riff on that dish is spectacular. brown coats dark-meat nuggets in a cayenne-laced sweet-potato starch, fries them to a dense crunch, and drenches the morsels in a butter-spiked persimmon hot sauce. the chicken bursts with a distinct poultry tang, offset by shards of crispy fried basil. wendy’s stock price would go through the roof if the chain figured out a way to take these nationwide.taiwanese fare, of course, is not new to new yorkers, but what makes win son particularly compelling in 2018 is that it’s benefiting from a resurgent interest in the asian nation’s cuisine, fueled by a new crop of young culinarians riffing on their ancestral fare. eddie huang was an early entrant with his baohaus, slinging soft pork buns in lower manhattan. more recent additions include zai lai in turnstyle underground market, where commuters pay $14 for pork rice bowls, and ho foods in the east village, where prospective diners endure properly long lines for beef noodle soup. following is a list of what to order at win son, with just one suggested skip.stinky tofu: the traditional night market snack, made odiferous via a long fermentation. the aroma makes even the longest dry-aged steaks seem as mild as chicken breast. dip in sweet soy chile sauce to dial down the durian-esque pungency.marinated cucumbers with bottarga: unlike the tart sichuan variety, win son’s version, laced with a heap of cured mullet roe, is pure umami bliss. the not-too-salty cukes pack the round mouthfeel of msg-laced bouillon.sloppy bao: soft steamed buns filled with a sweet-savory-spicy mix of peanuts, ground pork, and chiles.fried eggplant: batons of the nightshade fried in such an airy way that they almost taste closer to the yeasty fried dough called youtiao than a proper vegetable (on a good night; they sometimes turn a touch soggy). dip in a tangy black vinegar sauce, then drag it through a swath of kefir cheese, and repeat.clams and basil: cockles steamed in a sauce of shaoxing white wine, garlic, brown butter, and basil. it’s a straightforward mix of brine and diary, with a proper heap of scallion pancakes for sauce sopping.bk egg bomb: a riff on a pan-taiwanese dish, a scallion pancake coated in egg and fried. the win son twist is using the bread to hide a layer of chopped raw steak — fatty wagyu doused in lime juice, sesame oil, and doubanjiang, a sichuan chili bean sauce.fly’s head: the classic dish of ground pork tossed with incendiary thai chile, chopped garlic chives, and fermented black beans (which are meant to evoke the namesake insect). the meaty salad exudes a distinct funk from the beans, and is best enjoyed over a small plate of rice to catch all the meaty drippings.danzi noodles: firm ramen-like noodles in a dark, spicy broth of ham, chicken, shellfish, and chiles. a single head-on shrimp lies on top.beef rolls: a brilliantly drippy mess of star anise- and cinnamon-braised beef shank, wrapped in thin scallion pancakes and cut to the length of mini egg rolls. the bread is essential here because it tames the rampant salts, sweet aromas, and powerful bovine punch of the braise.big chicken sandwich: crispy, underseasoned dark meat on a tiger bun with fermented tofu mayo and cilantro. despite a custom youtube video advertising the offering, it’s just an acceptably average, uninspiring entry into the city’s crowded field of fried chicken sandwiches. skip it. lu rou fan: caramel soy-braised pork belly, a traditional dish where saucy, smoky swine enriches the rice grains underneath. the pork, enlivened by chile oil and tamed by the acid of pickled greens, is a one-plate meal for $15.zha jiang mian: a slow braise of lamb, fortified with beijing-style yellow bean paste, and softened with cucumbers. this is all tossed with fettuccine-like noodles — and more lamb fat — turning it into what’s essentially one of the city’s best and funkiest bologneses.ice cream sando: the sweeter analog to the “nutritious sandwich.” it’s made with the same fried mian tuan roll as the shrimp version, but is filled with vanilla ice cream and showered in fragrant cilantro and peanuts. the dairy melts fast under the warmth of the soft pastry, making this a sloppy knife-and-fork affair.so there you go: win son gives you doughnuts for dinner, and doughnuts for dessert. pretty close to perfect, right?cost: all but one dish is priced at $19 or less; sandwiches are $14; dessert is $9.sample dishes: marinated cucumbers with garlic and cilantro, sloppy bao stew pork buns,  bk egg bomb with wagyu tartare, fried eggplant with kefir cheese, clams and basil, lu rou fan, nutritious “shrimp cake” sandwich, danzi noodles with shrimp.bonus tip: to avoid a table wait, make a resy for a party of 5 or more, or come super early, right when the venue opens.sign up for our newsletter.the east coast debut of chicago’s most celebrated fine dining team fails to make an impactonce upon a time, there was an east village wonderland called booker and dax, a magically boozy place that sprinkled pixie dust over the city’s largely classical and overly serious cocktail scene. bartenders caramelized drinks with blazing-hot pokers and clarified ripe bananas into rum with centrifuges and froze basil leaves with liquid nitrogen. the complex techniques and wacky flavors made it the city’s only fully experimental bar. and somehow it was also an accessible experiment, with $14 drinks, $12 ham plates, and no reservations.it closed in 2016, but less than a year later, new york again has a modernist cocktail parlor, albeit in a slightly different latitude and altitude: the 35th floor of the mandarin oriental on columbus circle. the aviary, a spinoff of the chicago original, is the long-awaited east coast debut from the folks behind alinea, a world-renowned gastronomic playpen where chefs send out fried chicken liver mousse made to look like volcanic ash, and where patrons suck the helium out of green apple taffy balloons.so it’s no surprise when the aviary’s bartenders — a loose term, as the bar is a glass-walled kitchen — send out the following bit of whimsy: coffee-laced manhattans in clear bags filled everything-bagel perfume. a server cuts open the bag and the scent lingers for just a second. it is only transportive in the sense that it evokes something new yorkers eat every day for a buck. here, that aroma and the very average mix of rye and vermouth it perfumes cost $27. the aviary, alas, isn’t as accessible of an experiment as the dearly departed booker and dax. it is, however, a great place to instagram cocktails, if that’s your thing. perhaps you’ve seen photos of that bagel drink juxtaposed against the central park skyline, with the restaurant’s branding emblazoned on the bag? the staff will even offer to ’gram for you if your drink has a particularly intense interactive element.if only the aviary were also a great place to drink those cocktails. or pair food with them. bar snacks, typically a category of cuisine that’s meant to nourish (and dampen the effects of alcohol) trend in the direction of internationally eclectic hors d’oeuvres here at the mandarin. the bites are geared toward whetting the palate and draining the wallet, from the rustically expensive — a pork rind the size of a small child for $17 — to the nearly unshareable — about three bites of kampachi ceviche with thai green curry for $24 — to the wholly unshareable — alinea’s raviolo of black truffle juice, a single bite for $18.for those who care to avoid the wait for walk-ins, reserving a seat requires non-refundable deposits to the tune of $40 to $100 per couple in the evenings. if same-week a la carte spots are in short supply, it’s often easier to reserve for cocktail and canape tastings, running $280 or more for two after tax and service, a spendy reality that smacks of we’ll-only-book-you-for-bottle-service elitism.the deposit-style booking process also applies to the sister spot next door, the office, a windowless ode to leather and wood that serves cocktails that are more creatively traditional than avant-garde. think: amaretto sours laced with black truffle or old fashioneds infused with notes of banana and miso. it also serves beef tartare for $45. and iberico ham plates for $64. like the aviary, or much of new york, it feels designed for a particular tax bracket.to be fair, the aviary, the focus of this review, and the office remain true to their haute origins. frontmen nick kokonas and chef grant achatz are largely luxury restaurateurs; dinner for two at alinea can easily run $1,050 or more. the aviary, in turn, has been a spendy affair since its chicago debut in 2011. that bar, according to its own website, is where “cocktails and service are given the same attention to detail as a four-star restaurant.”that description, however immodest, feels apt when imbibing the “bring another smurf,” a cocktail that involves a layer of white-coconut cordial sitting underneath a purple frozen disc of pea flower-infused mezcal. it arrives in a freestanding glass pipe. you blow to mix the components. then you inhale. the stem liquid tastes strongly of booze and lime, while the aroma from the fat tobacco end of the pipe is pure tropical fruit. the drink doesn’t so much evoke a margarita as it does something dumbledore might imbibe in a harry potter novel.just as exhilarating is the gin and tonic. it’s a blend of bombay sapphire, apple, almond, and frozen cucumber that looks like a mad scientist’s green beaker, drinks like a slushie, and packs a level of vibrantly fizzy carbonation that almost borders on alka seltzer.that g&t is $21. that not a bad thing, per se. as wine pairings sometimes approach the price of tasting menus, and as martinis often cost more than a burger, there’s something to be said for spending a few extra dollars on bespoke cocktails that, arguably, inspire at the same level as a composed dish that likely took as long to create. but value is a product of more than just a few fantastic drinks. the bad news is the larger experience of spending an hour or two at the aviary isn’t quite as splendid as it should be at these prices. the bar, despite its seductive curvilinear sofas, feels like an extension of the hotel lobby. giant windows overlook central park, but the mandarin’s brightly lit reception area reflects back, partially obscuring the vistas. and the lounge-y soundtrack evokes the inane background music in a luxury car advert.meanwhile, some of the aviary’s other drinks fail to live up to their prices.take the “science a.f.” the complex and compelling elements of a penicillin — ginger, lemon, and scotch — are sucked up into a heated vacuum coffee chamber, tableside, where they’re all warmed up and infused with blueberry meritage tea. the resulting product, poured over ice cubes that melt quickly, has all the color, complexity, and flavor of watery hi-c. cost: $28.consider “in the rocks,” an old fashioned encapsulated in a sphere of ice. diners break it apart with a modified slingshot. it splatters cold shards of ice on the tables, and it results in a glass of under-diluted scotch, a bit of cassis, and none of the sichuan peppercorn the menu promises. it comes with a half a glass of champagne and costs $29. in the mood for a bloody mary? the kitchen places five tiny garnishes not on the rim of a highball, as is the norm, but on an elevated glass tray. those bites, which include a littleneck clam with spicy cucumber, as well as a little knob of tomato-horseradish gelee, are uncomplicatedly refreshing. then comes the bloody itself. a server pours it into a hole in the middle of the garnish tray, funneling the liquid into a small glass bowl filled with fresno pepper ice balls. it starts out as lukewarm, without any compelling acidity, then finishes as spicy and watery, without any compelling acidity. the cost is $38, more than a typical hanger steak.pro tip: do not make reservations for the aviary’s tastings. cocktail lounges are more pleasant when you don’t risk your own money on a pre-purchase agreement for a set amount of alcoholic beverages 14 days out. make the decision on how much to booze up when you show up.another tip: skip the ramen, an appetizer-sized portion of mushroom dashi and insubstantial noodles for $27. the chawanmushi is also a miss; the delicate japanese custard should tremble on the spoon like a flan that’s only barely set. here, it sports the denser consistency of a gently overcooked pot de creme. the a5 wagyu steak is the steal of the menu for $29. it’s all you need to understand the powerful beefiness and luxurious fattiness that this cut provides, and it’s an entirely better deal than at other venues, which typically charge $100 for unnecessarily large portions. finish with the pineapple, the sweet fruit acting as a foil to savory mole, or end with the white dessert, a plate whose monochromatic palette belies a stunning collection of textures and flavors, from coconut ice cream to lime sorbet to cashew pudding and tonka bean meringue. pair it with the carrot cake cocktail, a simple riff on the ramos fizz (egg white, gin, lemon) that tastes precisely of the cream cheese-studded sweet.so that’s the aviary. it might fulfill the needs of a luxury hotel, but it doesn’t represent the bright future of avant-garde cocktailery.cost: expect to spend over $125 per person, assuming three drinks each and a selection of small plates. cocktails range from $18-$38; the average price is $23. all bites are $29 or under. cocktail and bite tastings run $110, $165, or $215 per person.sample drinks: wake and bake (pillow, orange, everything bagel, coffee, rye), science a.f. (blueberry, lemon, ginger, honey, scotches), carrot cake ramos (rooibos, cream cheese, walnut), in the rocks (cassis, sichuan peppercorn, scotch, bourbon, champagne).sample dishes: black truffle explosion (raviolo with truffle juice); giant crispy pork skin, octopus croquette with bonito; kampachi ceviche; pineapple with mole, passionfruit, black mint.sake bombs can’t save major food group’s midtown spot from meh sushi“hollywood has invaded manhattan disguised as a japanese restaurant,” ruth reichl wrote in her review of nobu, the robert de niro-backed cash cow that was the epitome of raw fish innovation — before becoming a global luxury chain hawking generic sushi to rich people in dubai and moscow. over 20 years later, reichl’s quote again rings true for the lobster club, major food group’s absurdly derivative theme park of celebrity-, teriyaki-, and wasabi-laced revelry.the $10 million restaurant, a reboot of the old brasserie in the landmark seagram building, could pass itself off as a starburst-colored set piece from charlie’s angels: full throttle. a woman’s gold wrap dress mirrors bronze panels adorning the walls. a couple smooches on a sea-green couch, while an uneaten volcano of pink shaved ice sits untouched at a nearby table; the dessert matches perfectly with the pink, eero saarinen-esque chairs. servers in paint-splotched pants walk across a floor that mimics a jackson pollock canvas.shelves are lined with picasso plates; a back room is filled with picasso-inspired sculptures; and floating booths are decorated with interpretive collages of richard prince’s picasso nudes. peter marino (louis vuitton soho, dior london) is the big-deal designer, and for those who aren’t familiar, there’s a prominent photograph of him, in his classic leather biker gear, near the restrooms. everyone sips at lychee-tinis, yuzu sake-tinis, and melon mojitos at the three-deep bar. the crowd freezes as martha stewart marches out with her entourage.taken all in from the entrance balcony, the lobster club is a ball of pure, super-saturated, hyperchromatic energy, a departure from the solemn sushi or kaiseki temples that have been popping up around town. head chef tasuku murakami used to work at azabu, one of those michelin-starred temples. and now he’s here at the lobster club, whipping up spicy toro rolls completely devoid of tuna belly’s signature silky texture. those rolls wouldn’t be so infuriating if they were served at a cheap takeout spot in penn station, not here, as a $27 snack. it’s some of the city’s most disappointing high-end sushi. it’s been nearly a year since the restaurateurs/showmen behind major food took over culinary operations at the seagram building, the site of the old four seasons complex. the first space to open was the grill, a kennedy-era chophouse that tips its hat to the postwar optimism of the ’50s and ’60s. the second was the pool, which fast-forwarded to the present as a modern american ode to the world’s oceans — and a fancy contender to le bernardin.the lobster club falls somewhere in between, celebrating the chic japanese and pan-asian brasseries of the 1990s and early aughts. sometimes this means channeling nobu, with a sweet, $36 pile of crab sitting in a fragrant pool of vinegar and cilantro. sometimes this means leaning in the direction of china and indonesia, as with wok-fried lobster tail, the crustacean’s meat glossed with a lip-tingling layer of sambal. sometimes this means referencing a curry-ya through chicken wings covered in a explosive dry rub of turmeric, cayenne, allspice, cloves, and piri piri.and sometimes this means paying tribute to cheap karaoke joints with sake bombs or to post-war tiki spots (and red lobster) with coconut shrimp.generally speaking, there are four ingredients to major food’s special sauce. the first is an electric sense of theatricality, from the swaying palm fronds of santina to the exuberant tableside flambes of the grill. the second is high-profile art or design collaborations with the likes of renzo piano, vito schnabel, and merino. the third ingredient is a smart dose of quentin tarantino, which is to say mining the b-level dregs of popular culture and turning the undervalued and underappreciated into award-winning gold. a fine example is the michelin-starred carbone making haute analogues to comfort classics like rigatoni alla vodka or veal parm. that $67 parm, incidentally, brings us to the fourth and final part of the equation: major food knows how to charge an insane amount of money for what is usually pretty great food. dinner at the lobster club will easily run about $150 per person. the owners know that good ingredients, peppered with a touch of nostalgia and a bit of creativity, can command a markup. that’s not necessarily a bad thing. whether it’s christina tosi refining cereal milk or wylie dufresne rethinking combos, modern gastronomy can remind us why we loved a dish from long ago and impart cultural cachet. this explains why the lobster club’s sake bomb and coconut shrimp are actually two of the most thrilling dishes here. the bartender instructs you to drop a shot of yuzu sake, the color of limoncello, into a glass of yuzu-laced lager; the result isn’t so much a drunken 4 a.m. mistake as a balanced beverage with brilliant notes of sugar and concentrated citrus. the fried rock shrimp, in turn, collapse in the mouth with just a flick of the tongue, the coconut gently sweetening the natural oceanic sugars. even the tired dish known as teriyaki is a magical blend of sugar and soy, taming the vibrant oils of medium-rare king salmon. if only the rest of lobster club truly felt as if it were trying to improve upon the diverse traditions of new york’s japanese-leaning spots. sansho octopus, packing an impressively crispy sear, boasts none of the namesake peppercorn’s signature numbing — a sensation that’s generally accessible at any good yakitori spot. tuna with rice crispies, bland and underseasoned, pales in comparison to a perry st. version. raw beef with uni, a dish that first wowed me a decade ago at takashi, is somehow less thrilling here at $37 for a few tiny bites. teppanyaki, the entry point into japanese cuisine for so many suburban americans, comes across as less compelling when the performative, benihana-style griddle is hidden in the kitchen — and when it produces half a chicken whose skin is as floppy as bologna. better is the concentrated study in beef fat that is wagyu skirt steak.and finally, there is the sushi. a $68 chef’s platter arrives with unseasoned fish, and rice that ranges from firm to barely warm to chilly to gummy. on another night, the rice is well textured, but entirely cold. palate-perking wasabi is sometimes absent, and sometimes used in nuclear proportions. the grains exhibit little vinegar to balance the fattiness of (very good) deepwater snapper. murakami’s sushi is simply raw fish over rice. it is distinctive only in its mediocrity.the highlight of any meal at the lobster club occurs near the end, when a waiter ferries over a foot-high cone of shaved ice ($15), half of it laced with cream, the other half with blood orange. this kakigori is essentially a giant creamsicle, with a level of complexity that far surpasses the classic frozen treat. some bites are bitter from the citrus, others silky from the dairy, and still others refreshingly watery. and a bit a pleasant cognitive dissonance ensues when the sturdy-looking structure yields an airy-as-cotton-candy mouthfeel.one could speak as highly of the yuzu meringue tart, intensely sugary at first, with a sneaky acidity that builds as the dessert is consumed. and surely there are no other green-tea puffs with such a tightrope balance of tannic matcha and palate-softening cream.the shame, of course, is that while the lobster club’s website praises the work of both murakami and marino (as well as the head bartender), the name of the pastry chef, stephanie prida, is omitted. she’s nowhere to be found on the pool’s or the grill’s websites either, where she oversees the four-star sweets; the same can be said of the latter restaurant’s chef de cuisine, ashley rath.for a hospitality group that understands the story of a restaurant begins outside the restaurant — just as the hopes and expectations of a potential moviegoer are set by the trailer — it’s hard to fathom why such talented folks are left out of the credits. a prospective guest looking for a different culinary voice could end up wholly overlooking the restaurant because of these omissions. without prida, the lobster club is, for the most part, just another big-box asian restaurant, a luxury spot hawking generic sushi to rich people.cost: starters at $12-$36; teppanyaki meats at $31-$195; fish mains at $31-$36; individual nigiri mostly under $10; rolls at $10-$25. the “market price” eel appetizer can cost up to $48.\\xa0dinner can easily run $150 per person.sample dishes: chilled crab with vinegar and cilantro ($36); coconut rock shrimp ($17); wagyu skirt steak ($41); salmon teriyaki ($31); warm okinawa cake; blood orange shaved ice; matcha cream puffs, yuzu tart.chef sirichai sreparplarn serves thai fare that few other nyc restaurants offerstep into ugly baby and the bright colors explode: reds, oranges, yellows, and blues sponged on the walls, sometimes resembling clouds and mountains. the narrow room seats 25 at small tables and five along a counter that borders the open kitchen. the origin of the name? in thailand new parents hesitate to praise a baby to keep evil spirits away. calling a baby ugly almost guarantees good fortune, or in this case, good food.ugly baby was born with impressive lineage. this carroll gardens newcomer was preceded by two now-defunct red hook establishments, kao soy and a pop-up called chiang mai, both known for their advocacy of northern thai fare and adventuresome dishes from other regions. ugly baby’s chef, sirichai sreparplarn, worked both places. he thankfully forgoes the annoying practice, common in new york’s thai cafes, of providing a catalog of protein choices for each dish.sreparplarn parses his menu from the cuisine of bangkok and the four regions of thailand, with dishes selected for their novelty and powerful spice combinations, rather than for their familiarity to new york diners. the chef wants to surprise us with the breathtaking range of siamese cuisine. don’t expect pad thai, but if you want to blowtorch your mouth, ugly baby provides ample opportunity. gai golae (chicken thigh skewers), kang ho (pork shoulder with red curry paste), and pla tod kamin (yellow sea bream)the 20-item menu more fully explores southern thai cooking than any previous establishment in the city — dishes originating along the malay peninsula, which dangles from the main land mass of the country. this isthmus of beaches, islands, and mountains has a cuisine influenced by indonesian and malaysian food. witness gai golae ($10), a pair of chunky chicken brochettes thickly coated with coconut curry and grilled, like satays without the dipping sauce. they’re supremely wonderful. southern cooking is sometimes said to be spicier than isan, and spiciest of all at ugly baby is kua kling ($20). the menu carries the stern warning “brutally spicy” for this dry curry of coarsely ground beef and fresh red chiles. it comes decorated with green peppercorns and shredded kaffir lime leaves, dry and crinkled like nori. though suffused with a perfumy flavor, the heat begins rising with the first bite and never lets up.predictably, southern thai cooking is seafood-heavy, and the restaurant confirms it with tom kati sai bua ($25), a coconut soup of steamed mackerel and lotus stems, and pla tod kamin, a mellow yellow sea bream rubbed with turmeric and garlic. not all seafood recipes on ugly baby’s menu come from the south. attributed to central thailand, tom som pla kra pong proves a tart tamarind stew of red snapper filets, heaped up in the middle of the bowl like a tropical atoll.the menu hits you with something fantastic — or at least something interesting — at every turn. in the “interesting” category find teen ped prik tai dum, a heap of whitish duck feet in black pepper sauce. duck feet are more like crunchy pig ears than chicken feet, but the monovalent flavor of the dish makes a nice contrast to the spicy onslaught of the others. also providing relief are tue ka ko ($9), a quintet of small coconut-milk muffins embedded with black beans. you’ll wish you had some for breakfast.representing for isan is a fine duck larb with toasted rice powder sprinkled on top. on one try it was fine, but on another, it was way too hot, even for my chile-loving guests. on that occasion we gratefully followed it with the mildly spiced bangkok beef soup, which featured fatty chunks of brisket in a dark sweet broth. it might have been at home in a jewish deli.there are other charmingly plainish things, too, including a massive heap of bean sprouts with minced pork and tofu. the dish, called pad tua ngok rau kao ($14), seems like something you’d enthusiastically eat for dinner at home some night when you just wanted something simple.we’ve come to the part of the review where i tell you the best thing i ate at ugly baby. hung le is a chiang mai classic, a sweet stew of pork shoulder in red curry paste. the chef tosses it with mung bean noodles, herbs, and greens, sides it with pig skin and sticky rice, and calls it kang hoh ($17). like an ugly infant, it’s not much to look at, but it provides a kaleidoscope of flavors, probably unlike anything you’ve tasted in a thai restaurant before.cost: dinner for two, including four dishes, plus tax but not tip, $80.sample dishes: gai golae (chicken satays), pla tod kamin (turmeric sea bream), kua kling (spicy beef curry), laab ped udon (duck salad)what to drink: ugly baby is currently byob, so bring beer, a dry or off-dry white wine, or a fizzy red such as a lambrusco.the lower east side kaiseki spot packs in the extravagances, but little punchcaviar is expensive. but it’s also easy. it doesn’t need to be deveined and pushed through a tamis like foie gras. it doesn’t benefit from a deft tableside shaving over wood-fired pizza like with truffles. the lightly-salted roe of a mature sturgeon simply needs to be opened like a can of sardines and consumed. the most meaningful thing a chef typically does to caviar is mark it up. that’s not to say there’s no place for it in restaurants, but almost every high-end spot that’s wowed me with a composed caviar course has also gutted me with an experiment gone awry, often involving a modicum of fish eggs acting as an expensive form of salt. still, there are impressive exceptions. one of them is uchu, a kaiseki spot on the lower east side with a penchant for, and perhaps overreliance on, classic luxuries like truffles and wagyu. about halfway through dinner, chef samuel clonts, late of brooklyn fare, steps behind the black walnut bar with enough osetra caviar to trade in for a rolex. he takes a fat quenelle of roe, lies it atop a mound of vinegar-laced rice, wraps it in toasted nori, and hands it to you.osetra caviar nearly spills out of the completed hand roll.the emerald green eggs shimmer under the soft lighting; they practically spill over the side like a dripping ice cream cone. the first bite or so is cool and clean, the essence of the ocean encapsulated into firm pearls. as you work down the roll, the roe becomes softer and oilier, the crisp nori and warm rice intensifying the briny notes. the key here is balance. so many caviars can assault the palate with salt or fade into buttery nothingness. clonts brilliantly chooses a variety that works well mid-meal. this is all the more impressive since the preparation contains a whopping 25-30 grams of roe, a portion that could easily command $150 as an individual dish. here it comes part of a $200, service-included, twelve-course tasting. if only the rest of the feast were as compelling.uchu, located just a block and a half south of houston on a quiet stretch of eldridge, houses two separate venues, serving two different menus. operators generally employ these spilt-style restaurants to maximize accessibility. danny meyer perfected this style at the modern and gramercy tavern, placing a more casual, a la carte room next to a fancier, set menu space. but at oligarch-inclined uchu, the eight-seat kaiseki room actually is the more affordable spot. the front room features $300 tastings by eiji ichimura, a chef famous for stacking multiple slices of fatty toro on top of one another in a single piece of nigiri. owner derek feldman (who also runs sushi on jones), is clearly riding on the city’s prevailing luxury zeitgeist; the past two years have seen an unprecedented spate of new restaurants dedicated to japanese cuisine in its most rarefied forms. these small, expensive, lit-for-instagram venues represent a shift in the fine dining landscape, possibly reflecting a moneyed class who’d prefer a lighter style of gastronomy than what’s being served at the city’s european-american tasting palaces or haute steakhouses. even the sturdiest eater could only handle a gut-busting meal at per se every so often, but one could eat at ginza onodera, the obscenely expensive temple to raw fish, a few times a week and be none the worse off. this review will focus on uchu’s more creative kaiseki space. assessing the technical nuances of high-end sushi spots, which largely serve similar products, can at times feel like comparing two $500 bottles of burgundy; maybe one’s objectively better or maybe it’s just a matter of preference, but either way it’s a task that serves a narrower audience. also not to be discounted is the fact that uchu sets itself apart from the larger kaiseki scene in that the setting is essentially a cocktail bar. dinner begins when a staffer in a double breasted suit brings over a drinkable amuse, an electric mix of barley sochu, elderflower syrup, yuzu, and champagne. he pours it into a coupe so light the ounce and a half of liquid feels heavier than the glass itself. then the food starts appearing from the kitchen, which is odd because the point of sitting at a counter is to get a peek at the creative and technical process of cooking, watching as chefs contemplate micro-garnishes and turn hamachi fillets into translucent, abstract artwork through impossible knife work. at uchu, caviar rolling and truffle shavings notwithstanding, diners spend most of the meal looking at a handsome brown wall of whisky bottles, and watching a guy behind the bar make cocktails. he likes to use infuse his drinks with smoke, creating a slightly sweet haze that recalls a nightclub or your buddy who vapes too much. clonts kicks off the meal with uni. sometimes he places it in a glazed ceramic bowl above a layer of tofu and pumpkin — a study in soft textures from the land and sea. on another visit he might lay it above a dice of scallops — a striking contrast of orange urchin and black soy over a white dice of mollusks; it’s as if the mollusks are a bed of ice. a server arrives with an ornamental jewel box. she removes the top and reveals a few slices of octopus in dashi, floating aside a branch of purple shiso flowers and a potato. the flavors are clean, neutral, and not particularly memorable; it’s the plating that’s more exciting, a high-end boutique’s evocation of a small tidal pool. this is followed by a single bland bite of eel. next the kitchen might send out a tempura-fried spanish prawn, the minerally flavors of the mediterranean juxtaposed against a pool of a sauce of the crustacean’s own head — an elevated riff on katsu curry. or instead of the prawn, clonts might send out a few forgettable slices of fried sweetbread. inconsistency is an issue here. and then there is the question of uchu’s more traditional gourmet fare. in his letters to a young chef, daniel boulud wrote that “clientele and imagination determine what ingredients you should buy...it does not all have to be truffles, caviar, and foie gras.” his comment was prescient in that it preceded a decade-plus movement of young chefs redefining and expanding the notion of luxury as we know it, from the faux-shark’s fin soup of benu, to the lemongrass-flavored ants of noma, to the green apple taffy helium balloons of alinea, to the house-made mozzarella of torrisi. clonts, by contrast, is the rare young chef to rely a bit more heavily on traditional extravagences. this should not necessarily surprise: clonts spent five years at brooklyn fare, a french-japanese spot famous for making those luxuries feel exciting again.some of those same indulgences don’t pack the same wow factor here. his caviar is outstanding, yes. and there’s no one in the city using golden trout roe the way he is; the chef lies it over a pile of barely set scrambled eggs, two shades of the color yellow, one rich and creamy the other shockingly briny. it’s perfect, until you try it another night and the eggs are overcooked and lack their compelling richness.or consider the staple meat course, a slice of dry-aged miyazaki wagyu set between two slices of milk bread. it’s a riff on a dish that famously runs $180 in tokyo. here, the bread completely overwhelms the fattiness and seasonings of the beef. it tastes like any steak sandwich. rice laced with foie gras, the final savory course, has little of the duck liver’s signature richness; the ingredient is more oily than flavorful. the black truffles atop, in turn, lack the earthy complexity they possess elsewhere.the tasting winds down with mandarin sorbet and then a chocolate souffle. they’re both fine. better are the petits fours — soy caramels whose sweetness are tempered by a stinging brandy alexander, a final mini-cocktail to bookend the dinner.for a well-heeled clientele looking for classic, if not particularly inventive weeknight luxuries, this will do. but really, uchu needs work.price: $200 for the menu. beverage pairings are $125; cocktails are $26. japanese whisky flights available from $45-$195. all prices are service-included; there is no tipping at uchu.sample dishes: uni with scallops, egg with golden trout roe, osetra caviar hand roll, miyazaki wagyu sandwich, foie gras and black truffle rice pot, chocolate souffle.\\xa0robert sietsema awards three stars to the gowanus newcomerfor a few weeks at the end of last summer, there was no better place to be in brooklyn than claro. in the shadow of vine-covered trellises, with a light breeze blowing off the gowanus and cicadas humming in the trees, tables and a blue-tiled bar beckoned in the sunken backyard of what was formerly the pines. hunkered next to the restaurant was a wood-fired oven, where meats were grilled and flatbreads cooked on a griddle, everything emerging infused with the heady odor of smoke. to sit and enjoy a cocktail as your dinner was prepared in plain view was to experience the highest form of culinary expectation. and so a table of friends and i relaxed in the early evening just as the sun was setting and enjoyed a soupy shrimp ceviche known as an aguachile, a vinegary rabbit salpicon, and a mole amarillo of chicken with green romano beans in a lovely orange sauce. one of the virtues of claro, run by chef tj steele, is its concentration on the food of oaxaca, a brilliant cuisine from southern mexico rarely seen in new york city.the highlight of my first meal at claro, and one enjoyed in memory days later, was the pork rib memela ($16), a hand-patted flatbread topped with shredded meat and white cheese, with just enough chile de arbol to give it zing and acidity. the outdoor kitchen — and the way it imbues smoke into dishes — certainly is an asset.but on my following visits, some wood-fire cooked items weren’t available, though the owners say the outdoor kitchen is functional year-round. the menu had shifted around considerably. could claro make up for its wood oven deficit? the short answer is yes. replacements included a heart-warming chicken consommé with masa dumplings and shredded kale that did a convincing imitation of matzo ball soup, and a chile relleno stuffed with chorizo and potato sprawled in an earthy tomato sauce. the memela menu had been expanded, and so had the range of raw fish dishes and the selection of moles, too.let’s look at the moles first. these represent the cooking of indigenous nations that resided in oaxaca before cortes arrived in the early 16th century, painstaking sauces often containing chiles, nuts, herbs, spices, and even chocolate. in fact, the most famous of these, attributed to the state of puebla just north of oaxaca, is often called simply “mole.” legendarily, oaxaca has seven moles, identified by color and each having its own special uses. these are so difficult to make that many restaurants don’t bother.not so at claro. its menu includes mole negro ($32), a thick, midnight-black sauce with just a trace of sweetness that one-ups pueblan mole by toasting the spices first. claro puts a duck leg in it, sprinkles sesame seeds on top, and sides it with a rotating roster of vegetables, which on my visit included delicata squash and brussels sprouts. the sprouts didn’t really belong, but who demands absolute authenticity? the other mole currently on the menu is a mole rojo (red mole) with pork cheeks. please, claro, more moles! in its post-summer menus, the restaurant has gone wild with tostadas. these crisp toasted tortilla platforms are often used in mexico as staging areas for ceviches. claro’s yellowfin tuna tostada ($22) is perfect in every way, pink nuggets of fish mixed with blood orange and crunchy chicharron, and so is an octopus tostada with pickled chiles and tocino, a crispy pork belly. the biggest dud on a menu that contains few is a tostada smeared with a ground wagyu beef tartare, seasoned with the kind of gusano (worm) salt more often used on the rim of a margarita. i say bring on the insect larvae — but not in this usage.claro is one place where you shouldn’t ignore the desserts, even though only three are offered. best is dulce de calabaza ($12), a wedge of well-roasted pumpkin flooded with caramel sauce and sided with thick whipped cream. there is no earthier dessert in town, and it powerfully recalls the ancient origins of mexican gastronomy. and the restaurant will surely warrant a revisit for more wood oven fare. cost: dinner for two, including one tostada, one memela, one order of tacos, and a mole, and two margaritas, plus tax but not tip, $110.sample dishes: yellowfin tuna tostada, shrimp chipotle tacos, chorizo memela, duck mole negro\\xa0 what to drink: mexican beers, a michelada, invented cocktails featuring mezcal and tequila, mexican jarritos sodastwo stars for the spicy, stylish restaurant in east village and midtownbeef stomach. lamb stomach. cow tongue. rooster testicles. pig’s kidney. tenderloin. tendon. intestine. gizzard. artery. chicken heart. spam. it’s hard to think of a steakhouse, chophouse, or quite frankly any american restaurant that affordably serves more varieties of meat (or heck, vegetables) than málà project, the fiery fever dream of a sichuan spot with locations in the east village and, as of six weeks ago, bryant park. it’s just as tough to think of another culinary establishment that serves all of its wok-fried morsels in brown woven salad bowls. the kitchen sticks a foot-long wooden spoon into each communal serving — the kind used to mix romaine with vinaigrette — so that guests can toss duck tongues, oyster mushrooms, bok choy, five spice tofu, and sugary chinese bacon into the puddle of chile oil sloshing around the bottom. the chefs garnish this masterpiece with a fistful of cilantro. that’s my kind of salad.the dish in question is dry pot, a broth-free cousin of sorts to the traditional sichuan hot pot — where guests dip raw meats into flame-fired crocks of chile-laced beef tallow or soup. “by the end of the meal, i was almost delirious with heat,” journalist fuchsia dunlop wrote in her memoirs of a formative hot pot meal. “my mouth burned and tingled,” she added, describing the blend of buzzing, novocaine-like numbingness and heat known as málà. “my body ran with sweat. i felt ragged and molten. pain and pleasure were indistinguishable,” dunlop wrote. málà’s own dry pots traffic in precisely those sensations, though i’d politely suggest the pain and pleasure were quite distinguishable, with sometimes more of the latter than the former. spam, normally a non-violent luncheon meat, feels like oral acupuncture here. a slice of pineapple, like a desert mirage, promises relief, until the flecks of pepper cause one’s tongue to vibrate. eye round of beef, sliced paper thin and crumpled up like a discarded sheet of looseleaf paper, acts as a sponge to the crimson oil. it evokes the sensation of consuming a french dip soaked in gunpowder tincture, then swallowing a match.the fact that one keeps eating, despite the agony, is enough to make a rational diner question the nature of free will in the universe, or at least wonder what the heck they’re putting in here besides chiles. the answer, incidentally, is a lot; the spice blend includes black cardamom, orange peel, crushed gardenias, lesser galangal, nutmeg, and female ginseng. also worth noting: the lunchtime beef bowls ($13) cost less than an omega bowl from sweetgreen.málà is brought to us by amelie kang, a 26-year-old tangshan native who studied at the culinary institute of america, and meng ai, who graduated nyu in 2016 with a masters in financial engineering. the savvy entrepreneurs, who hope to continue expanding, are part of a small but growing number of current or former chinese university students who are opening restaurants across the u.s., giving voice to the diverse foodways of their homeland. case in point: just next door to málà in the east village is the tang, a noodle shop opened by two nyu seniors last year.new york of course has long benefited from a surfeit of excellent sichuan spots. what málà brings to the table isn’t so much a creative riff on a regional cuisine, common for younger chefs, as a smart repackaging of it. traditional sichuan venues ply their trade in environs that some might call utilitarian, with bright lighting, bar televisions, and tablecloths. málà’s two (equally awesome) locations, by contrast, adopt the visual lexicon of a stereotypically hip downtown establishment, employing brick walls, custom neon signage, communal tables, bench seating, waiters in distressed jeans, and carefully curated beer lists. it would be easy to dismiss this all as branding, to argue that málà is simply pandering to a ubiquitous notion of stylishness. but there’s also something to be said for using modern design tropes as a counterpoint to the classically-minded food, which comes courtesy of chef qilong zhao, a chengdu native.hao noodle in the village and birds of a feather in bushwick generally abide by the same modish ethos. together with málà, they form the sichuan analogues to keith mcnally’s crowded brasseries, everyday places for the cool kids to hang out and grab some well-executed, non-cheffed up grub.liangfen ($8), arrive the way they’re typically served, the slithery mung bean noodles doused in a light oil, with just enough zing to warm up one’s palate for the more incendiary dry pot. equally mild are the dan dan, a pitch perfect rendition of the classic noodles tossed with oyster sauce, chile, and numbing ground beef. slightly spicier is the husband and wife special, the famous sichuan salad of tripe and lung, the former as snappy as shaved green apple, the latter packing a cool concentrated beefiness. for a firmer texture, a few degrees north of jerky, dried pig’s ear is a wonderfully leathery snack to last the duration of the meal. anyone who hasn’t tried a thousand year egg would be well served to order it here; the two month cure of clay, ash, and quicklime turns the firm white into a gelatinous black and the soft yolk into a gooey, pudding-like green. the flavor is distinctly mild (these can trend quite sulfurous), even more so when paired with shishito peppers and dunked in the accompanying pool of sweet soy. one could subsist on small plates and dim sum here alone, but that would mean missing out on the main event.not too long ago, writers like josh ozersky were championing the virtues of nose-to-tail gastronomy, and chefs like david chang were dedicating proper menu real estate to offal. how things have changed. restaurants in 2018 highlight sweetbreads and other off cuts with less frequency, while the same sleepy steak for two from the same celebrity butcher seems to sell just about everywhere. sichuan spots have always been outliers in this regard, dishing out tripe and tongue long before and after they’d fallen in and out of vogue. what makes málà project a particularly compelling way to enjoy these cuts is that portions are tiny; diners build dry pots out of five or so items per person from a selection of nearly 70 ingredients.so a bet on tendon (as gelatinous as a gummy bear), lamb stomach (packing the barnyard tang of the namesake animal times ten), or artery (all the flavor of a handball shaved over a mandoline) can be hedged with heady chicken thigh, sweet crab sticks, delicate shrimp balls, overcooked pork ribs, or glass noodles. keep in mind that the noodles efficiently soak up a lot the chile oil; they will turn the insides of even a sturdy gourmand into a nuclear generator. another technical point: málà’s namesake numbingness is decidedly low level; this is a good thing for those who find the food at, say, mission chinese, to feel like a shot of novocaine from the dentist. others might try new legend in chelsea for a more balanced buzz.the dry pot feels suited to a generation of eaters raised on small plates and dietary restrictions; even a party of two can sample a butcher’s dozen worth of ingredients. and since málà lets diners order individual pots, a vegetarian in a larger group can have a proper feast of their own, instead of having to lobby the omnivores at the table for a few orders of greens. a smart meat-free order would be soft enoki mushrooms, thin-sliced potatoes, chewy rice cakes, crispy lotus root, black wood ear mushrooms (floppy yet firm, like perfectly cooked lasagna sheets), or any other infinite combination of vegetables coated in insane quantities of chile.seek relief with sixpoint bengali ale, redolent of rose, or a can of “milk drink,” a sweet blend of condensed milk and milk powder equipped with a bendable plastic straw. though really, neither quells the pain with any type of efficiency. the desserts, from the black sesame jelly to the sweet fried pumpkin cake, do a better job at cooling off one’s insides. though guests would be forgiven for skipping the sweets and simply doubling down on that deli thin eye round of beef ($6). málà might not be the city’s best sichuan restaurant, but it certainly holds a place alongside, say, cote or takashi in threatening to unseat the pricey and average supremacy of the new york steakhouse.cost: no more than $75 per person after tax, drink, and tip at dinner, and often much less than that. hot pots are $11-$13 at lunch. most appetizers are under $10. during dinner, diners build hot pots out of 4-5 items per person, with ingredients priced around $6 or less. sample dishes: fried peppers with thousand year egg, husband & wife lung and tripe slices, pig ear in chile oil, mung bean noodles with chile sauce, dandan noodles, dry pot with an infinite selection of ingredients, including spam and fried pumpkin cakes.bonus tip: the dry pots are available at mild, medium, spicy, or extra spicy. those who order “medium” or lower will experience scant heat and subdued flavors. “spicy” is the sweet spot for a fragrant, tolerable, sinus-clearing burn. those who dare to try extra-spicy are welcome to email this critic about their experiences.with its bountiful steam table, the richmond hill restaurant excels at a variety of west indian treatsthere’s no better vegetarian snack in the world than doubles. both singular and plural, “doubles” designates a pair of pliable, puffy bara (small flatbreads) loosely sandwiched around a pungent chickpea curry. the doubles is further flavored, at your request, with tamarind and scotch bonnet sauces — but ask for the latter sparingly, since it’s among the world’s hottest chiles. the doubles are particularly spectacular at singh’s roti shop & bar, a restaurant in richmond hill, queens. they’re priced at only $1 apiece, and two make a nice light meal. but they are only one of many culinary wonders to be found there. singh’s is located on liberty avenue, the bustling commercial center of the neighborhood where there are two dozen eating establishments, including roti shops, caribbean-chinese restaurants, punjabi kebab grills, and bakery snack bars. greengrocers displaying unusual fruits and vegetables like bitter melon and eddoes (a starchy tuber), sari shops and jewelers, and sellers of hindu, muslim, and christian artifacts also pack the street, and a temple sends its undulant spire skyward, while a white marble mosque is under construction.the area is called little guyana, though the owner of singh’s — who only goes by mr. singh — came to the u.s. from trinidad and intended the restaurant to appeal to people from all west indian countries. founded in 1990 and opened here in 1999, the inside looks like a disco and feels like a clubhouse for the neighborhood. a blue neon light runs around the room just under the ceiling, a mirror ball hangs in the middle, and sometimes, just inside the front door a dj sits, spinning calypso, reggae, soca, and cumbia, with stacks of cds for sale. on the left separated by a low wall see a glittering full bar, one of the few in the neighborhood. a whale of a counter displays pastries and savory meals at the end of the room, with four or five attendants standing behind it. on weekends, a line extends to the front door waiting for carryout. the attendants use an unusual system for putting your order together, each one functioning as both cook and counterperson. each attendant takes a single customer at a time, then zigzags along the counter grabbing pastries, scooping and slicing cutters, stuffing and folding rotis, assembling doubles and bakes, occasionally darting into the kitchen to prepare a dish. want a snack to go with a beer or tropical soda? pick a cutter ($7 to $9), which might be described as an indo-caribbean tapa. it might be a small plate of roast pork, garlicky with crisp skin; fried shrimp wontons; buffalo chicken wings; or length of black pudding, a thick blood sausage that originated in england.breakfast or lunch might be “bakes,” sandwiches of smoked herring, egg, curried mango, or fried shark, paradoxically made with dough that’s often deep fried rather than baked. other meals include lo mein and fried rice — available vegetarian, or with shrimp or chicken. akin to fried rice, but more indian in outlook, is a chicken pelau. speaking of chicken, your options are manifold: jerk chicken, fried chicken, and chicken coated with sweet barbecue sauce.but the heart of the menu remains the roti. while in india the word refers to a flatbread, it commonly takes on a different meaning in west indian countries, where indentured servants were brought from east india to cut sugar cane in guyana, trinidad, and jamaica starting in the 1800s. they needed a carry-able lunch to take into the fields, and the humble roti was turned into one of the world’s earliest wraps by folding it around a filling of goat, chicken, seafood, potatoes, chickpeas, or other vegetables, further seasoned with tamarind and pepper sauces.at singh’s roti shop, a bewildering range of filling choices is available for the roti ($4 to $10), running from the common goat, chicken, and oxtail, to the less common salt cod, tripe, and duck. (the tough duck comes in a dark gravy and doesn’t taste much like duck, but the other fillings are commendable.) the goat is particularly good here, though you have to eat your way around the bones. indeed, eating judiciously is one feature of the roti that will possibly annoy those who embrace chicken mcnuggets and the concept of effortless eating.make sure you have a dollop of potato and chickpea curry added to your roti, whatever the main ingredient. also consider having a vegetable like pumpkin or spinach tossed in, making the field hand’s meal a wonderland of flavors and nutrition. speaking of nutrition, the wrap-type roti is made with a flatbread known as dhal puri or roti skin, which has crushed yellow split peas between its layers, which adds to the fun.without going to too-great length, let me also mention a form of roti more suited to communal dining. called a “buss up shut” (dialect for “busted-up shirt,” referring to its tattered appearance), this roti features a giant flaky flatbread served on the side, so you can break off pieces and pick up bites. a similar arrangement pertains with the $5 breakfast roti, wherein the flatbread is matched with a single serving of vegetable such as eggplant (bigan), string bean, or fried potato (aloo). whichever type you choose, you can’t go wrong with a roti.pastries are a whole other game of cricket. suffice to say some are of english and others of indian ancestry, as evidenced by names like “fudge” and “jalebi.” anyway, when it comes to pastries, you’re better off at sybil’s bakery, across the street.cost: dinner for two, including one buss up shot, two doubles, a cutter, and two bottles of tropical soda, including tax, $22sample dishes: goat roti, roast pork cutter, doubles, blood pudding, smoked herring bake\\xa0 what to drink: tropical sodas made in guyana and trinidad are available, in flavors like ginger beer, mango, pineapple, and kola. beer also availablebonus tip: if you’ve never had a roti before, pick boneless chicken with potato-and-chickpea curry and one spoonful of “pepper” included. ask the attendant to add a dash of pumpkin, too, for extra flavor and sweetness.four stars for the prospect-lefferts garden restaurantthe distinctive food of rome is enjoying its moment in the moonlight, as a fit successor to our earlier obsessions with tuscany and naples. like naples, rome is a pizza town, but unlike naples, pizzas occur in a bewildering variety of styles. there are round cracker pizzas that can break apart as you bite into them; and thicker circular pies like those of naples, but slightly crisper. some pizzas resemble sullivan street bakery’s pizza bianca, oily and bumpy without sauce, sometimes used to make mortadella sandwiches; others are the bready focaccia squares found in bakeries, strewn with zucchini blossoms, onions, or other single ingredients.but one of the most characteristic styles is the pinsa. some would say it’s not really a pizza, but an oblong flop of dough rounded at either end like a huarache, perhaps originating in ancient rome as pizza’s ancestor. the dough is different too, a mixture of grains that cooks up light and airy. to compensate for this lack of weight, the toppings are piled on with a freer hand, including unexpected meats and vegetables. even in new york, where we’re proud of our wild and crazy pies, the pinsa seems unbound by convention.the stated purpose of prospect lefferts gardens newcomer camillo — named after count camillo negroni, the inventor of the negroni — is turning out pinsas from owner-chef michele baldacci, a florence native who’s also behind locanda vini e olii in clinton hill. as a result of the restaurant’s name, camillo’s supporting liquor program is heavy on the negronis ($10). while the normal formula of this strong swizzle involves gin and campari, one the nine available here is contrarily made with mezcal, while another features artichoke liqueur, perhaps causing the count to spin in his grave.the bar dominates the front of the restaurant, and its white marble expanse is the best place to dine. the dining room seats around 50 and is defined by old fashioned hanging lamps, beveled mirrors, and a ceiling that looks like the well-worn deck of a clipper ship. it makes you a bit dizzy staring up at it.the pinsas are spectacular. five depend on tomato sauce, while three others luxuriate in their white cheesiness. but the difficult choice this represents can be avoided: divided down the middle, a ninth pinsa, the romana ($15), mixes both types. on one side is a tomatoey amatriciana sauce from the town of amatrice in the apennine mountains about two hours outside of rome, featuring funky hog jowl. the other side is spread with cacio e pepe, the peppery pecorino sauce, another specialty of the eternal city.turning pastas into pinsas is a magical idea, also seen in new york city’s ziti and lasagna pies. other pinsas at camillo are equally startling. my favorite is the capricciosa ($19), a wild ride of heaped-up tomatoes, olives, artichokes, mushrooms, and prosciutto cotto (baked ham). it’s like a lush open-face sandwich you might take on a picnic. another pinsa features the very southern italian pairing of pork sausage and broccoli rabe, and there’s also a fine vegetarian pie topped with eggplant, two types of summer squash, and oodles of onions.if pinsas alone were the province of the restaurant, it would be a fine thing. but camillo seeks to be a full-blown italian restaurant, too, dotting its menu with dishes associated with rome, as well as other quirky regional cooking from around the country. from the roman stockyards comes coda alla vaccinara ($15), a dense ragu of boneless oxtail that dukes it out in the bowl with thick, wide, fresh pappardelle. equally splendid are two lamb-stuffed cannelloni smothered in béchamel like mutant enchiladas.the appetizers have shifted around quite a bit since the restaurant’s opening last september. i was particularly fond of cotechino, a cooked pork sausage that arrived on a bed of lentils, the way it’s done in bologna. it’s a dish usually served around new year’s and has since disappeared from the menu, though the team says it will return next december. meanwhile, the bowl of baby octopi awash in gritty red sauce that i didn’t much like — disappointing if you crave charred tentacles — still lingers. the best current app is anchovies on buttered toast ($8), in which dairy and carbs mellow the salty and stinky fish. even if you don’t normally order anchovies, you’ll like these.there are always at least three piatti, which should each be shared by at least two diners. the fritto misto ($17) is here interpreted in an all-veggie fashion, and comes hot and greasy on top of a sheet of brown paper. exercise the chicken option ($3 more) to add an extra highlight to the perfectly fried zucchini, onions, artichokes, and cauliflower. even better is a big hunk of roast goat in gravy, served on one occasion with cubed potatoes and on another with braised chicory.after eating pinsas, apps, pastas, and the voluminous main courses, maybe you’re not ready for dessert. but the slew of closers at camillo are the soul of simplicity, including a wedge of olive oil cake speckled with pistachios, or a creamy panna cotta dribbled with strawberry sauce. just the way they do it in rome.cost: dinner for two, including one app, one pinsa, and one pasta, two glasses of wine, plus tax but not tip, $70sample dishes: anchovies on buttered toast, romana pinsa, lamb cannelloni, pistachio olive oil cake\\xa0 what to drink: for those into cocktails, the negronis are worth checking out, but the best accompaniment to the trademark pinsa is an on-tap moretti beer or a bottle of lambrusco.bonus tip: for the budget conscious, the on-tap wines are a very good deal at $20 for 500 ml (try the prosecco); not showy or complex, they go very nicely with pinsas and pastas.sizzling kebabs and molten khachapuri await in bay ridgeof all the cuisines of the former soviet republics, georgian is the most delicious. it makes much of fresh herbs, turning soups and stews bright green. as with other countries along the silk road, kebabs are cooked over charcoal to be way fatty and smoky. composed salads constitute another strong point, with walnuts and pomegranates making frequent appearances. and for those who love dumplings, georgian examples are fist-sized, while the country’s breads are rapidly becoming new york classics.open one year, georgian dream is the city’s best restaurant from the mountainous republic that straddles europe and asia. it lacks the object-cluttered walls and paintings by late 19th-century artist pirosmani — showing dudes with massive mustaches — that characterize many other georgian restaurants. instead, sitting at a table is like being in the square of a serene village. up above hang street lights and balconies, whose doors seemingly might swing open at any moment as people wander out to admire the bay ridge sunset.the breads mentioned earlier include khachapuris, and the menu offers three contrasting examples from the regional cuisines of georgia. the one most new yorkers will be familiar with is khachapuri acharuli ($15), which resembles a bulbous canoe filled with molten cheese. on top of the cheese, threatening to swamp the canoe, are a raw egg yolk and a knob of liquefying butter. stir the ingredients before pulling off hunks of bread to dip in the delectable mess.for those uninterested in a jiggling raw yolk in a slippery pool of butter, cardiologically-speaking, the khachapuri megruli ($12) might be the ticket instead. shaped like a pizza, the bread is covered with a double layer of sulguni cheese. in fact, it’s what might be called a white pizza, only the cheese has been browned to make it chewier and more pungent. imeruli khachapuri features two layers of dough with the cheese inside. back in georgia, there are at least five other variations, some featuring boiled eggs and potatoes.you won’t find better charcoal-grilled kebabs than at georgian dream. the population of the country is largely christian, rather than muslim or jewish, so it offers pork kebabs ($12) not available in uzbek or turkish establishments. these are made with fatty ground meat and come dusted with sumac. they’re also wrapped in a flatbread, so you can eat them like cylindrical sandwiches. rice or french fries are served alongside. pick the fab fries, which are creamy on the inside, and a perfect sienna brown on the outside.among other easy-to-love treats are the huge, thick-skinned dumplings. like tibetan momos or shanghai soup dumplings, these khinkali ($12 for six) are round and puckered on top like a leather coin purse. they feature a mixture of ground meats seasoned with onions and garlic. when cut into, juice often spurts out.as if this were the american georgia, corn has made its way onto the menu in a big way in the form of gomi. this honest bowl of fluffy cornmeal porridge might be mistaken for hominy grits, and to further extend the illusion, the bowl is topped with butter and cheese. don’t miss it. georgian is also a cuisine loaded with stews. my favorite is chakapuli, a veal casserole with a bright green broth due to fresh tarragon — which also confers a liquorice-y flavor you might love or hate. probably the most famous georgian entree is chicken tabaka, which a friend has facetiously called “road-kill chicken.” it consists of a partly deboned bird that gets flattened, fried, and then paved with crushed garlic; it has long been a staple of russian and other former soviet restaurants. unfortunately, the version at georgian dream is pallid, and delivers no garlic wallop, so skip it. instead, turn to the vegetarian dishes that pack the menu.the regular tossed salads are pristine in their freshness and generously dressed, mainly featuring lettuce and tomatoes, and the pickle platter will remind you that, in a geographically confused way, georgia is on the fringes of eastern europe, even though it’s east of turkey. and so does olivie, which is a lot like american potato salad with a few extra veggies thrown in. but why not turn to the composed salads, which are more uniquely georgian?indeed, the “assorted pkhali” ($16) might be the best thing on the menu — it’s certainly the most beautiful. three compressed pucks of vegetable matter are aligned on the all-white platter: one pink, one yellow, one as green as a forest in springtime, all scattered with pomegranate seeds and fresh herbs. green beans, beets, and spinach are the vegetables providing the colors, stuck together with a walnut, garlic, and herb puree. and you won’t find a more delectable vegan dish in brooklyn.cost: dinner for two, including one salad, one cheese bread, a kebab with fries, and a stew, plus tax but not tip, $60.sample dishes: assorted pkhali (three composed salads), khinkali (dumplings), chakapuli (veal casserole), pork kebabs what to drink: georgian dream is byob, so bring beer or wine. there are also a number of great imported soft drinks on the menu, such as natakhtari tarragon lemonade and borjomi, a very mineral-ey carbonated water.thrilling small plates from northwest spain shine herestarting in the 1930s, manhattan had lots of tapas bars in greenwich village and chelsea, serving small portions of flaming chorizo and grilled octopus. but beginning in the early years of this century, tapas bars underwent a spectacular revival, with the newcomers introducing creative dishes at least partly inspired by the new spanish cooking of ferran adria and his disciples, like boqueria and tertulia. now a new place has opened up that proves tapas fever hasn’t abated yet.tomiño taberna gallega — located in little italy on grand street — specializes in tapas from galicia, a rugged land on spain’s northwest coast. there, bagpipes are still played, and the empanada was invented. the consulting chef is lucia freitas, whose restaurant in santiago de compostela, a tafona casa de xantar, remains one of galicia’s most notable. located on grand between mott and mulberry on the fringes of chinatown and little italy, tomiño provides an oasis of light late into the evening. the front half of the restaurant is a wood-accented barroom, with big doors that open onto the street, and a long bar with a fresh seafood case at one end. from that case fly langostinos a la plancha ($17), three jumbo prawns cooked on a griddle — head, antennae, beady eyes, and all. crunch at their buttery perfection.opposite are a pair of booths, which provide the most lively and comfortable seating. overhead a printed curtain ripples, upon which a mural of gleaners wading into the surf to pull percebes (gooseneck barnacles) from the rocks is depicted, though unfortunately, the restaurant hasn’t offered them. up a few steps, the rear dining room is more prosaic, with functional furniture, spanish pottery in niches, and an open kitchen at the end. both rooms feel very european.it is in that back room that you should chow down on any of the more substantial meals known as platos principales. bacalao con coliflor ($28) is the most interesting, a sizzling plate of fresh cod with potatoes and cauliflower swamped with béchamel, like a white wave breaking over rocks. also good is macarron de la abuela, a grandmotherly dish of penne, chicken, and forest mushrooms that one-ups chicken cacciatore. skip the risotto-like arroz caldosto ($48, for two), which is altogether too salty, sloppy, and soupy to merit the exemplary seafood washing around therein.but really, this is not a place for a formal sit-down meal, since most of the excitement is in the four other menu sections, which concentrate on small plates, several demonstrating the quirky and unique cuisine of galicia. check out the tortilla de betanzos ($10), named after a small town that was known as carunium in roman times. it looks like a round bouncy cushion upon which a jewel might be displayed, but when cut open, a liquid center of potatoes and egg yolk spills out. no more dry tortilla.huevos rotos con zorza turns out to be a wonderful hash of pork loin, eggs, and crisp potatoes; i could eat this every day for breakfast. foremost of all dishes that are more rare in new york is tomiño’s take on the empanada. the restaurant offers the version most new yorkers are familiar with, a folded and crimped pocket pie carried by spanish mariners all over the world. but the original empanada was more of a communal pastry, a giant pie cut into pieces. tomiño stuffs this giant pie with salt cod or chorizo and chicken, and serves it in four small rectangular pieces per order ($12).yes, tomiño also offers the greatest hits of tapas bars, including tiny, finger-size chorizos set aflame in a cast iron pan; gooey octopus dusted with paprika and stuck on toothpicks; and callos, a righteous stew of tripe, sausage, and chickpeas. the mellow delights of spain, which would be displayed right on the bar if it weren’t for nyc’s paranoid health department, are best experienced in the tapas combo called “mixta” ($17), which includes a wedge of tortilla, slices of serrano ham, pan con tomate (bread rubbed with tomatoes), and bowl of mixed olives.the food menu is bolstered by a powerful drinks program that allows a choice between galician beer and spanish cider on tap, expertly made gin and tonics featuring such flavors as raspberry and ginger, and vermouth, which is in many ways the signature beverage of spain. at tomiño, the list runs to nine varieties in shades of red and white, served traditionally in a tumbler with ice and an orange slice ($7 to $9). you won’t find a more refreshing beverage for sipping, nor one that goes better with a wedge of tortilla or pair of grilled sardines.cost: dinner for two, including four tapas, a shared main course, and two glasses of vermouth, plus tax but not tip, $100sample dishes: tortilla de betanzos (with liquid center), empanada de gallega del dia, huevos rotos con zorza (pork loin hash), and bacalao con coliflor\\xa0 what to drink: spanish draft cider, lemon gin and tonic, orujo grappa, vermouth, estrella galicia beer on tapzero stars for a cynical selection of poorly executed greatest hitsthose who spend too much time on food instagram know that envelope-pushing chefs like to hide pricey proteins beneath canopies of cheaper, well-manicured foliage. ignacio mattos of flora bar tucks slouchy gobs of sweet shrimp under neat squares of nori; the young kitchen at contra, in turn, obscures pork collar below thinly sliced radishes. one could write essays tracing the lineage of this technique and spend hours trying to discern its meaning, but the practical effect is unquestionable: diners experience a gentle surprise in an experience not unlike unwrapping a birthday present.so the story goes that jean-georges vongerichten, once a culinary trendsetter himself, has brought this technique to public kitchen, a new hotel restaurant on the lower east side. the dish in question is frico, traditionally a humble friulian snack of fried cheese crisps. but here, in a hip corner of manhattan, it takes the form of a large disc of cheddar. it magically hovers above the plate, hinting at something more underneath. is it a few slices of fatty pork jowl? nope. the surprise is a handful of stale popcorn. biting into the dish doesn’t so much evoke opening a gift as it does finding coal in one’s stocking.the more figurative surprise, however, is realizing that one of the world’s great chefs runs the city’s worst new restaurant.public kitchen is a curious name for a restaurant where a 10 p.m. reservation requires three weeks’ notice, where a handful of fried squid rings runs $14, and where a round of pre-dinner drinks for four, including a margarita whose aggressive sugars recall kool-aid demi-glace, costs $83. then again, public is a questionable name for ian schrager’s parent hotel; weekend rates generally start at $400 after taxes. those who book seats at the rooftop bar are sent an email asking them to arrive “early and with their entire group, preferably of equal ratios.” physically accessing the restaurant requires a journey. prospective guests walk past a spacious yard, which is a nice place to relax under a real tree with fake leaves, past a series of tron-themed escalators, past a gift shop hawking $600 sunglasses, and past a pastry counter that sells excellent (if slightly stale) strawberry eclairs. those who continue to walk back will encounter the restaurant, guarded by a host who, on at least one occasion, knows to reflexively look down at his little host computer (not up to make eye contact) when a patron approaches.i fondly remember the first time i was escorted past the privacy screens into the restaurant itself. chefs behind a marble counter retrieved second-rate pizzas from the fiery hearth, while waiters carried plates of zucca pasta with bacon and jalapenos, a preparation whose thin flavors recalled takeout from a mall food court. brown wood beams crisscrossed the ceiling, a handsome juxtaposition to the (plastic) ivy that hangs in the rear garden. i admired this elegant ballet before sitting down and realizing my right hand was gently sticking to the bottom of my chair, my fingers apparently coated in a veneer of someone else’s soy-ginger sauce. or whatever it was.in the late ’90s and early aughts, vongerichten was the chef rethinking fine dining in new york, seamlessly weaving asian sensibilities into haute french cuisine, serving impossibly affordable lunch tastings at his eponymous central park west flagship, and helping launch the careers of experimentalists like wylie dufresne and johnny iuzzini. in 2017, vongerichten is a slightly more complicated internationalist, presiding over an empire of nearly 40 establishments and concepts across the world. a handful of these venues are ambitious and distinctive. in 2010, his abc kitchen helped spark our prevailing vegetable- and toast-heavy zeitgeist, while his abcv, in 2017, continued that trend with bold vegan flavors (and juicero machines). but the bulk of his worldwide venues, alas, appear to be bland facsimile spots, peddling wagyu in cabo, eggs benedict in dubai, burrata in sao paolo, and fried calamari in shanghai.public kitchen, according to its website, specializes in the “best of ‘new york’ food, ‘world food’ really, and all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is new york city.” in reality, it’s doubtful that anyone marginally familiar with the five boroughs would identify the bill of fare here as anything other than “international hotel” food. even manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it’s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.lobster, frico with popcorn, and black truffle pizzadishes with an asian bent, the chef’s longtime comfort zone, feel less like revolutionary imports and more like they’ve been appropriated from the corporate commissaries of clubstaurants like tao or buddakan. butternut squash potstickers are insipid blobs of sweetness. raw tuna ($19), which takes the ethereal form of udon-like ribbons at the jean-georges flagship, devolves into an indistinct, underseasoned, chile-laced mash at public; the spicy hand rolls at sushi chain wasabi in penn station would be a more compelling substitute. and shrimp toast ($22) turns out to be flaccid sticks of soggy, loosely bound crustaceans. anyone armed with a box of gorton’s and a toaster oven could achieve more texture.it’s ironic that a bad meal from vongerichten, who holds three michelin stars at his flagship, isn’t something new or out of the ordinary; the new york times dealt him goose eggs for v steakhouse in 2004 and mercer kitchen in 2006. but as restaurants around town struggle with labor costs and skyrocketing rents, the abject awfulness of public serves as a cynical lesson for chefs who are transitioning from being brash, we-might-fail-any-day envelope-pushers to conservative middle agers. that lesson is you can still draw in throngs of fashionistas and magazine editors — public might actually be a tougher reservation than the grill — with poorly executed greatest hits. take the black truffle pizza, a dish vongerichten offers in too many locations to help pay the rent and serve as a “you’re back at home” totem for jet-set diners. i still remember the first time i sampled it uptown at the mark, where it was gently crispy and filled with the potent musk of wet earth. at public, the kitchen charred the exterior crust to a carbonic black, while the interior drooped flaccidly. the signature fungi paste, in turn, exhibited the color and texture of wet mud. among new york’s fanciest french chefs, vongerichten has never been known for particularly compelling service, but the staff at public find a way to make the concessioners at yankee stadium look four-star by comparison.i tell a bartender i’m waiting to eat at the counter. “we don’t really take names,” he replies. after waiting for an hour i finally snag seats and ask for a menu. “what kind of menu?” how about a dinner menu! i ask how the steak is prepared. the answer: “rare. medium rare. medium. medium well.” the correct answer is that the strip is marinated in soy and dressed in a fermented black-bean dressing. neither seasoning does much to salvage the commodity-quality beef, which boasts all the flavor of grilled seitan. food comes out as it’s prepared. this means that if you order two pizzas for the table, one comes out as a mid-course, while the second, which you’re happy the kitchen forgot because you’re getting a bit frustrated by the point, magically appears when you’re just about done with your mains. that second pizza, incidentally, isn’t so much an actual pizza as it is an oil-soaked sponge of potatoes, aged gruyere, and bacon. those who find themselves here would be best off ordering the the chile lobster. it tastes like chiles and lobster. waiters will push a slightly-above-average tartufo for dessert; the more responsible decision is to leave.when i try to make a follow-up reservation and see a 10:15 p.m. sunday-night booking disappear before my eyes, opentable recommends i try the clubstaurant vandal instead. it’s a clever suggestion. vandal is almost as lousy as public, but one’s expectations are lower (it’s the tao group), and the space is decorated with a collection of murals that are amusing enough to contemplate while hate eating dishes like “new york hot pretzel steak tartare.”public kitchen, in turn, sets expectations high with the jean-georges name yet delivers a generically bad hotel restaurant.cost: starters at $8-$19; pizza at $16-$22; pastas and mains at $18-$39. sample dishes: popcorn-cheddar frico, spicy tuna tartare, shrimp toast with water chestnuts, black truffle pizza, soy-garlic steak, lobster with chile butter.two stars for el quinto pino and txikito in chelseawhen chef alex raij opened el quinto pino in 2007, she served typical tapas — white anchovy fillets, salt cod fritters, and shrimp in garlic oil. she also offered atypical fare — a sea urchin panino.the sandwich inspired an amusing game of critical one-upmanship. when peter meehan of the new york times reviewed the chelsea spot, he declared the oceanic panino the “sandwich of the year.” a few months later, blogger andrea strong wrote that the “unini,” as she called it, had taken on “legendary, if not mythical status.” serious eats then upgraded panino to “sandwich of the decade” in 2009, the same year the frank bruni cast a broader net, calling it an “era-defining treat.” they’re all impressive accolades for something that looked like an underbaked grilled cheese sandwich. the dish hailed from an era when restaurants didn’t calibrate visuals for social media; instagram was still three years away and the iphone had just debuted. good news: the sandwich has not been beautified for the smartphone era. the only thing that’s changed is the urchin itself, which raij says is higher quality. the pressed bread shatters when bitten. the squishy urchin bleeds neon juices. the sweet taste of uni fills your mouth — until mustard oil kicks in and stings the sinuses; that condiment doesn’t so much cleanse the palate as provide it a momentary reprieve from the funk of the sea. and while bigger restaurants — toro and the pool — would go on to serve uni sandwiches on toast with mustard, none have the approachable, iconic calling-card status that raij’s does. the serving vessel was, and still is, wax paper. this is not uni as a luxury item, which it often is. this is uni as a sandwich, meant to be consumed while standing up, on the go. it is one of new york’s great dishes. as a certain strain of soul-draining monotony infects the new york dining landscape, with deep-pocketed empire builders and big-time chefs looking for the next big thing, be it counter-service pasta, nouveau delivery, or quinoa-laced beet bowls, it’s refreshing that diners can still turn to a veteran, non-rock-star operator and find cuisine that’s simultaneously creative, thoughtful, and affordable. el quinto pino and sister spot txikito around the block remain two of the most compelling expressions of iberian fare in new york. the former has few equals in the sphere of tapas, while the latter might just be the city’s top basque spot. both fluently alternate between the traditional and the modern, between pan amb tomaca and double-patty burgers. and both do so without charging more than $30 for pretty much anything. maybe we should all be paying less attention to new restaurants with full-time social-media coordinators or fast-casual ambitions, and more to venues that have been grinding it out for years without a place on the world’s 50 best list. la vara in cobble hill might be the michelin-starred jewel of raij’s tiny empire, which she runs with her co-chef and bilbao-raised husband, eder montero, but that venue, an ode to the sephardic and moorish traditions of spain, can command two-hour waits on a saturday night. neither el quinto nor txikito, by contrast, generate much of a queue for walk-ins. in fact both are so close to each other and the food comes out so expeditiously that one could literally hop between the two.an ideal game plan: kick off the festivities at el quinto with cumin-spiced lamb skewers, follow up with chile- and anchovy-laced queso fundido, then scoot over to txikito for ethereal salt cod fritters, with an interior blended to the texture of mousse and a heady flavor that evokes seafood chowder, and funky head-on shrimp.then return to quinto for a frozen dark and stormy and rabbit paella where the yellow rice is a brilliant conveyance mechanism for the nuclear-powered aroma of saffron. one could continue eating. el quinto began as a single tiny room. a larger dining area off to the side opened in 2013, but the heart of el quinto is the bar room, with sconces the shape of antelope horns, wallside dining ledges as small as airline seat trays, burnished mirrors, chalkboard menus, and a curved marble counter — a classic design hack that lets solo patrons face other people instead of the bartender. the size of dishes are proportionate to the room. they are small, rarely more than a handful and a half of food. and they are often unexpectedly sweet, but never in an unwelcome fashion. cantabrian anchovies lie on crackers adjacent to thin sticks of vanilla butter; just as the salt starts to overwhelm, the sugar-laced dairy wipes the palate clean like a milkshake. bomba toledanas — spiced beef and potato fritters — come anointed with a thimble’s worth of habanero puree. the floral heat gently burns, until a mash of sweet peas, sitting below each croquette, cools the palate. and a pile of incendiary spreadable soppressata — essentially spanish ’nduja — comes with a well of honey in the center, a classic menorcan pairing that only seems foreign until you realize it’s the functional analogue to maple syrup-laced bacon.basque cuisine, at its heart, is a “cuisine of subtraction,” raij writes in her cookbook, drawing contrast to the region’s more complex avant-gardists, from arzak to mugaritz. “fancy embellishment is stripped away until you are left with the essence of an ingredient.”and while el quinto pino is not a basque restaurant — more about txikito in a bit — her statement rings true. or put differently: at el quinto pino, raij and montero use supporting flavors to deify a lead protein or vegetable. their cooking evokes a superb three- or four-ingredient cocktail. waiters don’t spend an hour describing the food upon presentation, because a spice or seasoning listed on the menu is apparent to the diner immediately upon consumption, without explanation or elaboration. for example: shrimp fritters can verge into scallop-like sweetness in other hands. at quinto, the kitchen uses brown krill to draw out the deeper, richer, mid-tide tang of xo sauce. and while raij says she pairs plancha-singed calamari with garlic and parmesan to evoke a pasta, the umami-rich ingredients end up producing a simpler and grander effect: they make squid taste more like squid. it is near-perfect food. txikito is the slightly more creative restaurant, with certain refinements (no sandwiches, no burgers) and a somewhat heavier nod to seafood, in deference to the basque love of all things maritime. even the fries here, doused in paprika, arrive with a ramekin of cod-laced mayo. like at quinto, the cooks sear squid on the plancha, only they slice them into spaghetti-like ribbons and drape them over a puree of pine nuts with onions. they riff on txangurro, the traditional stuffed crab, by slicking the shellfish with cream cheese, warming it under the broiler, and lighting it ablaze with the very non-basque sriracha; it packs as much crustacean flavor as a good crabcake yet it costs just $8.the kitchen shreds skate wing with parsley coulis, fried garlic, dill, and cilantro, treating fish as if it is a salad ingredient meant to be tossed in a verdant and fragrant salad of herbs. it’s the type of dish one might expect at the two-michelin-starred aska.guests have more elbow room at txikito. the bar is just a little bit longer. the wood-paneled walls don’t need windows to create the illusion of space. the garage-like front opens up during the spring, and sidewalk tables appear outside. it’s something to dream about until things get warmer. until then, make do with the homemade navarran sausage, a semi-firm “rope,” as the menu calls it, of pork jowl cut with paprika. the smoke of that spice is brilliantly restrained, recalling a charcoal grill’s dying embers.raij forges chewy little gnocchi out of shrimp and iberico; the pink surf-and-turf nuggets, tasting simultaneously of shellfish and aged ham, arrive in a delicate squid ink sauce. ropa vieja, the cuban dish of shredded steak with peppers, is de rigueur as well. txikito substitutes brisket and stuffs it into green peppers, balancing the meatiness of the protein against the vegetal tang of the capsicum. softening the richness further is a layer of yogurt and a whisper of non-traditional yuzu oil; raij tells me that for most of the dishes, she provides the inspiration, while montero, a native of basque country, pushes back when necessary. lemon cake, cut with orange-flower water, makes for a fine dessert. but it’s also hard not to resist dropping by el quinto again for a sea urchin sandwich to go. during a year when so many new restaurants are soporific at best, spending all the more time at venues we’ve overlooked is a pleasant act of gastronomic protest.cost: most tapas and sandwiches at $16 or under; many dishes under $10.sample dishes: squid a la plancha with parmesan and black garlic, shrimp and chickpea fritters, moorish spiced lamb skewers, beef croquettes with habanero and sweet pea puree.bonus tip: the uni panini is rock star dish here, but do not sleep on the anchovies with vanilla or the menorcan sausage with honey.cost: all bites (pintxos) at $10 or less; larger portions at $10-$20, with a few specials in the $20s and $30s.sample dishes: salt cod croquetas, crab toasts, chorizo hash sandwiches, squid ribbons over pine nut puree, homemade navvaran sausage rope.\\xa0a chain from india knocks punjabi dishes like butter chicken out of the parkfor many of us, the first indian cuisine we fell in love with came from punjab: lamb and chicken in thick gravies pungent with ginger, garlic, and masalas, flaunting powerful flavors that put european gravies to shame. and those meaty curries were matched with meatless ones that taught americans new ways to look at vegetables like spinach, potatoes, and cauliflower. but as the present century dawned, other regional indian cuisines from places like kerala, hyderabad, and gujarat came to supplant — or at least rival — it in our affections. now, the punjabi menu has returned at chawla’s 2 in enhanced form, and the time has come to give it another try.the punjab is a region that sprawls across india’s northern frontier into pakistan. it lies along the silk road, which has historically provided ready access to spices that are often used by the handful. the sikh religious group’s center and principal temple is there in amritsar, a city that’s name-checked several times on the menu. amritsari kulcha ($3.49) is one example — an herb-flecked, potato-stuffed flatbread brushed with oil. it could become your favorite indian bread.chawla’s 2 represents a restaurant chain with 110 branches in australia, new zealand, and canada, as well as northern india. it was founded in a town northeast of new delhi in 1960 by s. attar singh chawla. the “2” in the moniker signifies a modern approach to cooking, featuring locally sourced ingredients and a menu emphasizing tandoori cooking and adding other fare like indo-chinese. located just southeast of gramercy park, the restaurant is well lit and boxy, decorated with playful cartoons of colorfully turbaned sikhs juggling veggies and spinning flatbreads in the air.complete meals for one person are a real bargain, mainly in the $10.99 to $13.99 range and including a main dish, dal, and roti or rice. larger entrees accompanied with rice are paradoxically $3 less, so it’s better to marshal a group of friends and share several. then you can also explore the appetizers, which are hidden away in the sections called “sides” and “from the fryer.”appetizer gobi manchurian ($10.99) comes from the indo-chinese canon, battered and deep-fried cauliflower smothered in a tangy sauce. most places it’s greasy and syrupy, but here the dish is relatively light. with similar flavors, lollipop chicken deploys wings with the flesh pushed to the end of the bone, making them look like chupa chups. for vegetarians, chilly paneer and chilly mushroom — using a common indian spelling of “chili” — are good choices. a particularly filling starter is keema naan, a naan stuffed with ground meat that comes with a bucket of mild gravy.but let’s cut to the chase, entrée-wise. one of the best features of the restaurant is the use of cream rather than milk in its recipes. cream chicken ($8.99) is the menu’s flagship: boneless bird in a buff-colored sauce lacking the expected masalas. it tastes herbal and almost french. one of the herbs is certainly fenugreek, and the recipe, formulated by the chain’s founder, is further enriched with crushed cashews.this dish seems like a challenge to the more commonly seen butter chicken, a punjabi crowd pleaser featuring poultry pieces in a pink tomato sauce. some fellow diners and i decided to compare cream chicken to butter chicken one evening, and i was the only one who preferred the cream chicken. “the butter chicken is a little bit sweeter and more richly flavored,” one friend observed. i recommend trying them both side by side, and rendering your own opinion, since they’re two of the most delectable things on the menu.the northern vegetarian indian standards are all available in above average renditions, including malai kofta (vegetarian “meatballs” in a thick sauce), palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese cubes), and mushroom tikka. but the best vegetarian choice here is kukuri bhindi ($6.99) — shredded okra fried until the green vegetable achieves the consistency of fruit leather. jumbled with raw yellow and red bell peppers and purple onions, the dish is an explosion of colors and textures. and for those who detest the usual sliminess of okra — this method of cooking banishes it.in line with the fresh and natural aesthetic of the restaurant, the tandoori chicken is not colored red with artificial dyes. instead, it is coated with a beige spice paste before roasting in the oven. while wholesome tasting, it doesn’t pack the smoky wham of the usual recipe, so skip it. one dish i found particularly interesting was something i’d never encountered before: rara mutton. pieces of tender lamb swim in a sauce laced with lots of ground chicken. ground chicken? well, for folks who always order the meat lover’s pie in a pizzeria, consider this a great choice.cost: dinner for two, including one app, entrees, one bread, two beers, plus tax but not tip is $50.sample dishes: keema naan with gravy, cream chicken, gobi manchurian, chawla’s special biryani\\xa0 what to drink: kingfisher or taj mahal indian beer are good choices, but skip the wines available. the restaurant’s “fresh lime soda” ($3.99) is wonderful, filled with unexpected flavors.smoky charcoal-kissed kebabs and heaping serves of plov delight at the new uzbek restaurantto all the chefs decorating their restaurants with stone hearths as expensive as teslas and fire-spitting grills that shine like cadillac rims, here’s a bit of advice: dine at nargis, a new park slope spot from one of new york’s best uzbek chefs. the staff here can roast meats better than you, and with a heck of a lot less bling.a small window lets diners peek into the kitchen, where a chef stands behind a plain steel trough filled with smoldering coals. the setup is as pretty as an air-conditioning duct. skewers of veal liver, lamb leg, and chicken heart lie inches above the coals, turning various shades of pink, tan, and brown. the chef twirls each kebab, or shashlik, six or seven times to ensure even cooking. he picks up a magenta hair dryer, slowly waving it past the white embers. the spurt of air speeds up the combustion process, akin to the oxygenating effect of a blacksmith’s bellow, only this comes courtesy of a plastic grooming device sold at duane reade for $25. grilling at nargis isn’t instagrammable performance art. it isn’t tableside flambe. it is simple cooking. affordable cooking. masterful cooking. the kitchen sends out cumin-laced chicken thighs whose gentle char, preternatural juiciness, and complex notes of smoke recall the delicacies of tori shin, a high-end japanese hangout where a tasting for two easily runs $200. but here, at this months-old sequel to the sheepshead bay original, a proper dinner date won’t cost more than $80 after tax and tip.give credit to chef-owner boris bangiyev. in an era when the fates of so many restaurants rise and fall on reviews from the major critics, social-media fervor, high-paid design firms, and photographic virality, this 39-year-old tashkent native built a loyal following with little of the above. here are some of the quirks one might notice while dining at the park slope location: a nonworking atm downstairs, cheesecake factory-like headsets worn by the waiters, a 7-foot tall waterfall in the backyard garden, and a soundtrack that always seems to include “what’s up” by 4 non blondes. the restaurant itself is distinguished by its exposed red brick, ornamental carpets, stunning tiles the color of uzbekistan’s sky-blue minarets, a mural depicting the historic madrasas of samarkand, and a bar television that shows the ballgame. the bar is often empty. the real draw of nargis, of course, is the breathtaking melting-pot cuisine of uzbekistan, meaty and muttony traditions that balance turkic, asian, persian, and slavic influences. cabbage kimchi — stalin deported thousands of koreans to uzbekistan during the second world war — sparkles with stinging heat and high-voltage acidity. lagman, the classic uighur dish, is everything it should be: a crimson lamb soup laced with mild chiles, green beans, peppers, and toothsome hand-pulled noodles. and the pan-central asian chuchvara, pan-fried beef dumplings in the shape of tortellini, arrived drenched in heady caramelized onions that alone would merit the $13 price.this type of food isn’t in short supply in new york, where nearly half of the country’s 63,000 uzbek immigrants live. rego park and forest hills in queens are home to cheburechnaya and scores of other great kosher central asian spots — frequented by the bukharan jews who fled as the soviet union collapsed. uzbekistan’s muslims, by contrast, have largely settled in sheepshead bay, kensington, and elsewhere in brooklyn, thousands of them having availed themselves of the diversity visa program to flee economic hardship at home. their presence in king’s county paves the way to success for excellent and occasionally halal spots like tandir bakery, emir palace, and cafe kashkar.so what sets nargis apart? the fact that it’s in park slope, an increasingly exorbitant slice of brooklyn not particularly known for its sizable russian or uzbek population. that’s no small matter.every single table at nargis in sheepshead bay was full on a recent friday. my companion and i ordered markovcha, the classic korean-uzbek salad of shredded carrots doused in vinegar, garlic, and chiles. the kitchen piled the vegetables vertically and generously, as if this were a savory cotton candy, balancing notes of sugar, acid, and heat.bangiyev opened his flagship in 2007, when the food-writing community was laser focused on the east village and the ascent of david chang. nargis started as a 40-seat spot sandwiched between a florist and a dry cleaners, but as those businesses closed, he expanded, raising the seat count over 150 to meet the booming demand.the chef tells me that non-russian, non-uzbek customers were rare in the early days. as the chef himself puts it, “people would say, ‘what the hell is uzbek food?’” but over the years, that sentiment changed and his clientele diversified. “that gave me the strength to say, ‘other people besides our own love my food,’ and that’s when i said it’s time to give park slope a shot, which i considered the big leagues.”still, bangiyev is likely aware that the former soviet union’s diverse foodways — or geography — don’t quite carry the same currency among the so-called food elite as regional mexican or thai fare. hence, a bit of unobtrusive but amusing pedagogy begins every meal in park slope. each guest receives a paper placemat depicting a map of eurasia, with the restaurant’s country of inspiration highlighted, just in case anyone doesn’t know precisely where uzbekistan is.nargis park slope, like its flagship, does not traffic in upscalification. nothing is a miniaturized, nasturtium-topped riff on something humble and hearty from back home. bangiyev does not sell overpriced kebabs with wagyu beef or foie gras (though if he did, i bet they’d be grand). the closest thing to fusion or local adaptation is the slice of new york cheesecake.bangiyev serves classics. he slicks his beef tongue and radish salads with mayo. he stuffs samsa, flaky meat pies with juicy, chewy bits of beef, lamb, and onion. he forms non (uzbek bread) into the shape of an old-timey car wheel, as is the style in tashkent, baking it in the tandoor to a light golden brown. the middle is flat and pretzel-like, like a hubcap, while the round, almost pneumatic exterior is pure bagel chew.bamboo baskets of manti — dumplings the size of a xiao long bao — come stuffed with pumpkin, the official gourd of central asia. the flesh itself is spiked with a traditional blend of black pepper and raw sugar: just enough sweetness to require a dunking in tart sour cream. bangiyev’s charcoal-tinged kebabs rank among the city’s finest. he lets the bamboo smoke permeate, but never overpower, the flesh in question. skirt steak ($8) bursts with concentrated beefiness. lamb chuck exhibits a restrained funk, a marked tenderness, and beguiling sweetness. the heat transforms chicken hearts into springy, snappy saltiness, with little sinew or offally tang. and chicken wings stun with their technicality; the gentle cooking renders out all the schmaltzy fats, leaving the skin with a blackened crispness whose texture recalls phyllo and whose complex aromas evoke porcini. if any of the meats are too fatty, douse them with chile vinegar and cleanse the palate with beer. pair the kebabs with plov, the elaborate pilaf that’s essentially the national dish of uzbekistan. bangiev cooks it the traditional way, fat-slicked basmati rice heated in a steel kazan over shards of carrots and layers of lamb leg. the flavors are unambiguous: the natural sugars of carrots amplify the funk of game. at this point, the pain of stomach distension sets in. quell the hurt with black tea, and order the classic central asian wedding dessert, chak-chak. the kitchen stacks crispy bits of fried dough atop one another in the style of a bee’s nest and drenches them in honey. i started to fall in love with uzbek fare in the early aughts, when my father would bring home kebabs from sheepshead bay, near where he worked. we’d eat the grilled lamb with vodka tonics or red wine while watching the yankees on tv. back then, when too many americans viewed their fellow citizens with suspicion because of the way they looked or the language they spoke, it would’ve been hard to imagine that there’d soon be too many uzbek restaurants to count in new york, that places like nargis would be standing room only, and that a tashkent-born chef would eventually expand not just to park slope but to williamsburg as well, which is his plan for 2018. what a city.cost: salads, soups, and starters: $9-$16; kebabs: $7-$14; mains: $12-$25.sample dishes: tongue salad, lagman soup, lamb and beef samsa, chebureki, pumpkin manti, chicken- heart kebab, lamb kebab, ground beef and lamb kebab, chuchvara, chak-chak.claire welle and samantha safer’s clinton hill restaurant beautifully challenges local dinersthe realities of foie gras production, which involve force-feeding duck or geese, have prompted chefs to seek more humane alternatives, from self-engorging birds to blending chicken liver with butter. but what if the best way to mimic the taste of this classic luxury is to do away with death altogether? during a recent meal at otway, an envelope pusher of a restaurant in clinton hill, a server ferried over a dessert plate of yeast semifreddo, a healthy-sounding combination that recalled bean burgers or kale smoothies.the kitchen makes an ice cream base out of cream and butter, blends in fresh yeast and dark, malty vegemite, freezes the mixture in a disc-shaped mold, lets it partially thaw during dinner service, and tops it off with huckleberry puree and a rye cookie. the color is tan. the texture is denser than gelato. and the flavor is a dead ringer for foie gras. i asked the waiter whether there’s liver in the dessert. she shook her head. i continued eating, slowly, and then furiously.the duo of yeasts imparts the product with a subtle minerality. and the huckleberry, laced with a whisper of verjus, kicks in the requisite sugars and acidity to keep everything balanced. the recipe is simple, almost mundane, but the alchemy that occurs somewhere in between emulsification and defrosting results in a transformation one might more closely associate with a hogwarts spell than an act of normal gastronomy. and if that still comes across as too avant-garde, otway sells regular foie gras too. the yeast semifreddo, like so much else at otway, is not the product of a silicon valley fake-meat startup. it is not the combined effort of a culinary team with a deep background in avant-garde flavor combinations. the dish is a simple act of experimentation. claire welle, who creates the pastries, says she chose yeast as a flavoring agent because she wanted to “explore ingredients used for function and see if they could operate as flavor.”here it’s worth noting that welle is essentially the head baker, as well as the executive chef, butcher, fromagere — she makes her own hungarian liptauer — dishwasher, and occasional server. when i ask her about all these duties she says everyone in the kitchen shares responsibilities. she refers to herself as a “dirty line cook.” her business partner, samantha safer, balances the books and bartends most nights. safer steers me toward the snails on a recent evening. they are deshelled, skewered, grilled, and served in a verdant pool of parsley coulis. the snails boast the texture of delicate clams; the coulis tames the saltiness. the dish also includes under-roasted sunchokes, which you can eat around.otway opened one year ago, born from the ashes of tilda all day, a venue that safer and welle ran with a third partner before a sticky breakup.the single room of a restaurant, at first glance, looks like any painfully chic american bistro. imagine: soft lighting, brown wooden chairs, white walls, pressed-tin ceilings, an amaro cart, giant windows for performative brunching, cute little shelves sparsely packed with ornamental birds and plants. but on second glance, a more complex design scheme reveals itself. there’s the wallpaper, with all of its green, perpendicular zigzagging; the diagonal parquet paneling; the bartop that cuts back and forth like a hallway from tim burton’s beetlejuice; and the partially tiled floor, unfinished like a game of minesweeper. the physical space is an ode to elegant, and somewhat unexpected, angles, a rubric that jibes with otway’s small plates, which subvert in powerful and surprising ways. fried chickpeas crack and crumble. then they jolt the palate, first with a wallop of vinegar, then with the sweet musk of dry-aged beef fat, which coats them like a doughnut glaze. kohlrabi, sliced thin and rolled up like rigatoni, is pleasantly tart. pierce your fork further down. hidden underneath is a puree of cured bayonne pork and mayo, a modern riff on a 1970s ham salad. carpaccio, the paper-thin salad of the meat world, looks like any other. now take a bite of the raw venison. the crimson flesh acts as a sublime delivery mechanism for subdued flavor of pine; welle tells me she makes the oil from a juniper bush one of her cooks found in sunset park.these bits of delicious whimsy make otway, along with olmsted and the dearly departed gwynnett street (where welle worked), an important fixture in one of the city’s more sparsely populated restaurant categories: the experimental neighborhood spot. these are venues that don’t just push back against the safer gastronomy mainstream. they also promote, by virtue of their crowds, the notion that residential areas are teeming with diners who crave culinary creativity.helping this matter is the fact that every small plate at otway is under $20. even half a dozen oysters, easily $24 in some manhattan venues, are just $12 here. and incidentally, there is nothing hifalutin or tricky about them. they’re just briny, perfectly shucked bivalves. the first course at otway is always bread, and it’s always free, a necessity that can smooth over the fact that it sometimes takes 10 minutes to get drinks and a cool half hour for snacks to arrive. the current offering is a naturally leavened miche loaf with a soft, sour, almost custardy crumb and a sturdy crust whose flavors recall burnt chocolate. otway also puts out a fluffy, butter-drenched rye to pair with the venison carpaccio and a denser, nuttier rye to balance out acidity of boquerones and fat of butter in her anchovy toast. of course, one shouldn’t overlook the toasted miche that comes with the silky foie gras torchon; the chefs slick it with enough rendered duck fat to impart it with the unmistakable tang of dry-aged game. and since we’re being comprehensive, welle, during brunch, also serves brioche with chocolate, dill biscuits, financiers, squash miso quick bread, coffee cakes, sticky maple buns, and an olive loaf. welle says she doesn’t consider herself a proper baker. i disagree. and while otway’s selection isn’t quite as wide or technical as, say, high street on hudson, it ranks as one of the more satisfying new bread programs in the city. does the crepe count too? for most of last year otway rolled it up and topped it with uni, a dish that’s been discontinued due to quality issues with the urchin. the current preparation involves folding the small crepe into the shape of a taco and stuffing it with a generous supply of cold, salty crab and bevy of herbs, from parsley to fennel. it is an improvement on 99 percent of the lobster rolls hawked in this town, and it costs just $13. otway uses its mains to counterbalance some of the edgier tendencies of the starters. there are just four entrees. i vouch for two of them; skip the run-of-the-mill hanger steak and the vegetable pot au feu, whose thin onion broth and competently cooked potatoes make it feel more like a side dish than a compelling composition in its own right.welle’s best meat course is a pitch-perfect duck breast, with cleanly rendered fat, crispy skin, and a clever wallop of clove to counteract the gentle gaminess of the bird. stewed cranberries add tartness and color. just as impressive is the dorade, its skin as crisped as a chicharon, with the flesh of the fish lying in a sweet, concentrated lobster sauce. if the kitchen is offering its coconut pot de creme as a special, order it; a layer of passionfruit curd tames the sweet custard. otherwise, the right move is the aforementioned yeast semifreddo. it’s a shame that restaurants like otway only seem to come along once every few years or so; homegrown venues providing affordable, accessible inspiration will do a heck of a lot more to bring more folks into the dining world than, say, yet another fast-casual chain.cost: starters at $3-$18; mains at $23-$28; desserts at $9-$12sample dishes: anchovy toast, kohlrabi with bayonne ham and chervil, crab crepe with herbs, raw salsify with pine and huckleberries, dorade with sauce american, yeast semifreddo with huckleberry and rye.bonus tip: advance bookings available via resy; the bar is open to walk-ins but fills up quickly.chef joël robuchon’s chain is expensive and unimpressiveequinox has coolers filled with eucalyptus towels. soulcycle has its grapefruit-scented candles. netjets private aircraft have their exclusive cajun snack mix. every luxe empire has a signature amenity, something patrons enjoy for a few seconds and then forget about. at l’atelier de joël robuchon, one of the world’s most expensive restaurant chains, that amenity is mashed potatoes. guests at the new manhattan outpost receive a small, rich pot of pommes puree during the final savory course. fan-like indentations decorate the top layer, a deft act of latte art for potatoes.the freebie seems generous in an age when a side of steakhouse potatoes can command a steep price, but keep in mind the cheapest steak here is a 6-ounce american cut that costs $95, service included.waiters announce two things upon presenting the pommes. first, they identify the product as “joël robuchon’s” potatoes, in case anyone suspects that the “chef of the century” outsourced the recipe for a mere side dish. second, they claim that the potatoes themselves are “famous.” this is true. in 1980s paris, the indulgent spuds helped robuchon make a name for himself at his now-closed jamin. the impossible ratio of butter to fingerlings, as well the fact that robuchon was serving such a humble dish at an ambitious venue, epitomized the chef’s efforts to counter france’s lighter, brighter, yet somewhat affected nouvelle cuisine. the dish does not live up to its legendary status, at least not here in new york. vigorous whisking imparts the potatoes with the texture of silk, but the dairy fats, which cool quickly, stiffen up to the density of a leaden paste. the potatoes do not taste of the earthy starch any more than they taste of good butter. they almost taste of nothing. and so through the power of manipulation, such an integral part of fine dining, robuchon’s cooks have taken two of the world’s great ingredients and turned them into haute crisco.once upon a time, before the robuchon incorporated assembly line manufactured foie gras-stuffed quail at a dozen spin-offs across the world, l’atelier was a relevant new york restaurant.the original manhattan location opened in 2006, a few years after robuchon shook some of the stodginess out of parisian fine dining with japanese-style counter service and spanish-style small plates. the big apple l’atelier was a key player in our city’s own culinary tie loosening; the chef’s tapas-focused menu ensured well-heeled walk-ins could dispense with large sums of cash on visually stunning small plates almost as quickly as on a pair of manolos. it closed in 2012. nearly half a decade later, l’atelier is back, this time in a cool corner of west chelsea. it is not a relevant new york restaurant. as countless small plates places put out ambitious fare that’s not just creative but rationally priced as well, l’atelier has devolved into a mediocre bacchanalia for the rich.it feels like 2006 all over again. the champagne-by-the-glass list is veuve clicquot-only. the color scheme is classic l’atelier: jet-black stools contrasted against crimson leather cushions and a shiny rosewood counter. the room is decorated with green apples in glass bowls, chile peppers in jars, and dried spaghetti in black vases, a design ethos that recalls the getty images stock food photography archive. the soundtrack is international hotel lobby bossa nova.the menu highlights dishes that could’ve been copied or adapted from robuchon outposts in taipei, singapore, london, or quite frankly anywhere. a handful of black truffle shavings are paired with a salad of cold artichokes and foie gras ($75); the muted, obvious flavors feel ripped from the first-class cabin menu of a 1985 transatlantic flight to london. wagyu beef, in turn, is subjected to the clubstaurant slider treatment of the aughts, two tiny, underseasoned, overcooked burgers (topped with foie gras) for $44.the kitchen slathers steak tartare with so much mustard and worcestershire that it imparts the tartare with the mouthfeel of a chunky pudding, drowning out the fattiness and flavors of the meat itself. this appetizer is nearly double the price of better versions at estela or wildair.questions of relevance aside, what’s frightening is how representative l’atelier actually is of contemporary new york. it symbolizes a city overrun by an affluent corporate monoculture, from boutique spin classes that charge thousands for yearly memberships to fast-casual salad chains that don’t take cash to sushi chains where a $200 starting price almost seems like a break. l’atelier, whose prices feel rooted in an effort to exclude, attracts a wealthy class of new yorkers willing to pay stupid sums of money for brand-name luxuries. on any given night the 34-seat counter appears just as crowded as the one at ssäm bar. patrons occasionally show up in red carpet-style blowouts, perfectly tailored suits, and backless dresses. “this goes great on granola and yogurt in the morning,” a russian speaker next to me says of the 1983 chateau d’yquem she’s drinking, a heck of a breakfast condiment at $1,150 by the bottle. her companion orders a shot of macallan m whisky, which runs $750. i’m sure it was great.l’atelier’s menu isn’t so much an exercise in creativity as it is an exhausting effort in repackaging the same preparations over and over, in different sizes, in different menu formats, and at different prices. the $325 tasting, which this critic did not order, is mostly a listicle-like aggregation of dishes from the a la carte offerings.here’s a bit of advice: order the beet and apple tartare, tangy cubes of the fruit topped with a pungent green mustard ice cream. or try the aubergine, confit cylinders of eggplant, as soft as gelatin, over dots of light, bright vegetable curry. just as remarkable is the bass, steamed to a perfect flakiness and scented with a light foam of lemongrass. le bernardin would be lucky to serve such a masterpiece. and virtually any bread by boulangere tetsuya yamaguchi is stunning, from the comté-pocked bread boats (like mini georgian khachapuri) to the simple, flaky escargot rolls.meanwhile, skip the sweetbreads. the kitchen served them with the sinewy connective tissue still attached, making them difficult to cut even with a steak knife. the thymus glands were undercooked to such a degree that they jiggled like jell-o. some bites packed a bilious tang that recalled beef cartilage that had turned.a little bowl of chestnut soup with little knobs of foie gras is fine, but surely suffers from the city’s most expensive soup per slurp ratio at $42. a snack-sized portion of saffron risotto, with little saffron flavor or any type of compelling fat to soften the grit of the undercooked rice, runs $38. a green curry sauce is brilliantly aromatic; the three scallops that sit in it recall the flavor of styrofoam.there is an acceptable duck main at $36 — if acceptable to you means a single slice of canard with less profound aging, delicate fats, or crispy skin as at the pool or, quite frankly, most any other competent restaurant in the city.pastry chef salvatore martone fills a fist-sized sugar sphere with buttermilk chantilly, lemon sorbet, and thai basil gelee; it’s approximately 45 seconds’ worth of electric acidity and citrus aromatics for $28. at this level of quality i’d (begrudgingly) pay that price again.it’s tempting to recommend l’atelier as a dessert-only venue, because virtually all of the sweets are fantastic — just keep in mind that a humble tasting of three will pump up your bill by nearly $100. the only skippable dessert is the “chocolate sensation” — an oreo crumble-coated scoop of white chocolate cream, with a touch of mousse, that constitutes the most expensive riff on cookies and cream in the universe ($28). that dish, like others, is available at l’ateliers across the globe. the fact that robuchon has remained the world’s most michelin-starred chef for the better part of a decade by essentially opening up the same restaurants over and over again is more critical of the french culinary guide than it is of him. and the fact that humans flock to this duty-free lounge in chelsea — and order clubby wagyu sliders at such a clip one expects a model-dj to drop the bass halfway through dinner — says more about the mall-ification of new york, and the demand for luxuries as obvious as a gucci clutch, than the predictable output of a chain restaurant.cost: small plates, $28 (eggplant confit)-$95 (american wagyu ribcap); main courses at $52 (beef tartare)-$135 (filet mignon); desserts at $28. set menus are more, obviously. all prices are service-included. expect to spend about $200-$300 per person on a la carte meals.sample dishes: eggplant confit, maine lobster with black pepper, beet and apple tartare with green mustard, beef and foie gras burgers, scallops with green curry, sugar sphere with lemon sorbet and thai basil gelee, white chocolate ice cream with oreo cookie crumble.bonus tip: the same building hosts a more approachable joël robuchon restaurant called le grill de joël robuchon\\xa0, or “the grill,” which sells a $24 cheeseburger, $58 iberico ham, $95 maine lobster, and desserts that command the same price as at l’atelier.'"

       "  'The most useful thing to know about Vandal, a bacchanalian Bowery temple to viral foods, faux street art, and a basic cocaine lifestyle, is that it’s adjacent to another let’s-have-a-long-night-out spot that’s actually worth visiting. Zhen Wei Fang, backed by Wei Chen and the Congee Village team, pairs its pristine hot pot fare with an absolutely wild environment. ',\n",
       "  'A robot host greets guests in Mandarin. Mixed martial arts matches play on four televisions. Michael Jackson pumps through the sound system. Multitiered meat trays rise 3 feet above every table, flaunting vertical croppings of raw lamb, beef, and tofu skin. Diners use chopsticks to plunge red ribbons of New Zealand lamb ($15) into white bone broth, turning the flesh brown, soft, and succulent. You slurp the meat almost as easily as you would a noodle. ',\n",
       "  'Want to combine hot pot with a few hours of sake-fueled karaoke? There are private rooms for that. There are also semi-private rooms that double as immersive multimedia carousels. High-tech projectors broadcast computer-generated nature footage on three separate walls, giving patrons the sensation that they’re dining inside an IMAX universe inspired by 1990s screensavers. Leaves fall over ersatz mountains; palm trees sway in the digital wind. As a waiter sears expensive wagyu over a hot stone, snow falls upward toward outer space. The title song to Free Willy plays on the speakers, and you let silken A5 wagyu, slathered in pork fat and Sichuan chiles, dissolve on your tongue for $80.',\n",
       "  'What a New York story: In the literal shadow of one of the city’s most irrationally packed culinary establishments is a hangout that’s killing it — a little more quietly, and with a lot more heart. And in case anyone’s worried Zhen Wei’s visual antics might compete with the gustatory bliss, there’s another place called Tang down the block hawking high-end hot pot fare in a more sedate environment.',\n",
       "  'The back dining room at Zhen Wei Fang.',\n",
       "  'Once upon a time, a hot pot spot in Vegas was the country’s most expensive restaurant. The chef was Masa Takayama (yes, that guy), who served a $500 omakase of shabu shabu, the Japanese adaptation of the Chinese tradition. It didn’t last, but New York has a solid representation of that elevated style at Macoron, where a celebrated hot pot tasting runs $128. ',\n",
       "  'Chinese hot pots, by contrast, a pan-regional tradition with roots in the Han Dynasty, haven’t reached those levels of extravagance in the Big Apple. High-end Sinosphere fare isn’t nonexistent — one thinks of the $150-plus fish-maw platters at Oriental Garden or the black-truffle luxuries of Hakkasan — but such venues haven’t yet reached the critical mass of expensive French, Japanese, or Italian venues.',\n",
       "  'Local hot pot cuisine in particular remains an affordable affair, ranking with Korean barbecue and American smokehouses as some of the most accessible and vital Big Apple restaurants for groups. Some, like Hou Yi in the East Village, draw in budget diners with $31 all-you-can-eat affairs and self-serve ice cream bars. Others, like Mister Hotpot in Sunset Park, aim for a late-night crowd, hawking reasonably priced meats until 2 a.m.',\n",
       "  'What sets apart Zhen Wei, and the Sichuan-leaning Tang down the block (more on that below), is that they’re modernizing the Manhattan hot pot experience a bit more pronouncedly than their excellent peers. It’s all in a similar vein to the efforts of other ambitious operators from the mainland and Taiwan, which is to say they’re updating and repackaging their ancestral fare for a booming Chinese student population — and anyone else willing to spend a few extra dollars at more fashionably contemporary restaurants.',\n",
       "  'That roughly means patrons at both venues will encounter, to a greater or lesser extent, posh interior designs, performative sourcing, bespoke cocktail lists (ugh), craft beers, orange wines, exorbitant wagyu and abalone, and, at Tang, a lighting scheme so Instagrammable that the Museum of Modern Art would be jealous. ',\n",
       "  'If any of these touches make it feel like a beloved tradition is adopting the moneyed signifiers of obnoxiously hip restaurants, rest assured: Both venues manage to keep their souls — counterbalancing stereotypical indulgences with classically Chinese organ meats and powerfully fragrant broths.',\n",
       "  'The communal experience is a central element of a hot pot meal; one imagines a hungry crew huddled over a single steaming pot. Dinner at Zhen Wei, however, is more uncommonly individualistic.',\n",
       "  'Each patron selects their own $6 broth, which simmers on a personal induction burner. It’s tempting to assert there’s something inherently ridiculous about such a setup; one wouldn’t expect a single order of fondue to come in three separate crocks for sanitary reasons. But I’d retort that the courtesy is entirely less absurd than so many other elements of upscale dining, from the use of four plates underneath a single starter at Per Se to the use of eight different wine glasses during a tasting-menu beverage pairing. ',\n",
       "  'Or, more practically: It’s fun to try out different broths at Zhen Wei by dipping into your neighbors’ pots. It’s the soup version of share plates.',\n",
       "  'Most options work well with everything, though the spicy Sichuan gives a nice kick to neutral items like soft tofu, gorgeously gummy mung bean noodles (take them out when they turn translucent), slippery tendon (as weightless as shaved bonito), and feathery enoki mushrooms. The intensely porky tang of bone broth, in turn, imparts a savory, swine-y aroma to flaky red snapper and firm sea scallops. And sweet and sour tomato, packed with electric acidity and umami, helps tame the gentle funk of lamb or tripe.',\n",
       "  'Every broth boasts a voluptuous roundness that makes them sippable on their own; they’re even better poured into small wooden bowls for ramen-noodle dipping. And although the patrons do much of the cooking here, those stellar soups, intensely funky XO ramekins, and all the prepared items are the fine work of chef Wei Huang, a Guangdong native and pan-regional virtuoso who helmed Zhen Wei’s first location in Miami.',\n",
       "  'The chef grills cumin lamb skewers in the style of a studied Xinjiang hangout, offsetting the juicy meat with marshmallow-like fat. He sends out chilled bang bang chicken that balances the poultry’s clean punch with the searing heat of chiles. He whips up shellfish boils on par with Le Sia, coating barely cooked-through lobster claws with a mess of salted chiles.',\n",
       "  'And he also oversees a kitchen whose cooks ensure everything is sliced thinly enough to cook quickly. This part is simple enough: Tongue tastes like tongue; Spam tastes like Spam. But for what it’s worth, the shaved ribeye is so well marbled it seems to disintegrate with the same elegance as Japanese wagyu, and packs no less flavor at just $12. I recommend enjoying all these cuts in the back room, decorated with four 82-inch televisions, each of which shows Jackie Chan singing on a variety show, on mute.',\n",
       "  'For those who insist on wagyu, Yu Liu’s Tang Hotpot, an offshoot of the East Village noodle shack, provides it at a marginally lower cost. It’s sold here for $65, or as a smaller portion as part of an $80 combination platter with pleasantly chewy abalone, flaky snapper, heady goat leg, beef short ribs (cut a bit too thickly), paper-thin pork, and shrimp (impressively flavored when simmered in seafood soup).',\n",
       "  'The only catch is that the broths, served communally in copper pops from Yunnan, are nominally more expensive than those at Zhen Wei, though they can serve up to four, making them cheaper for larger parties. Spicy Sichuan starts at $18 for the table, while a more “curated” version of the same soup — with a separate pot of pork bone broth — runs $23. ',\n",
       "  'Spoiler: Both taste about the same, delivering no more complexity or flavor than than the versions at Zhen Wei (and arguably a touch less). That brings up the central issue with Tang. Notwithstanding the fact that New Yorkers unquestionably underpay for Chinese fare in almost every form, the quality of Tang’s food and service don’t necessarily match the higher prices it commands. Its beef and lamb selections don’t sing with the clear, powerful flavors one expects. And really, there’s no need for condiments like $4 truffle-oil sesame paste.',\n",
       "  'But what Tang can flaunt is a smart beverage program, energetic bar crowds, and shiny digs — evocative of a mid-aughts power spot — by New Practice Studio, the same firm that did stylish restaurants Hao Noodle and Hunan Slurp.',\n",
       "  'A host escorts Canada Goose jacket-wearing patrons to room booths. Louis Poulsen Radiohus pendant lights, set at uneven heights, do their best impression of summertime fireflies, casting dim luminescence on Italian soapstone tables and chartreuse banquettes. A balcony overlooks the dining room — evoking Geoffrey Zakarian’s erstwhile Town — while most tables get a clear view of artist Xu Han’s piece de resistance, a painting of Tang-court women incongruously eating modern hot pot alongside an Oktoberfest-sized lager.',\n",
       "  'Staffers ferry over sparkling orange wines in thin-lipped glasses, or sake cocktails in coconut shells, often 10 minutes after you order them. And smart-tablet ordering systems mean that food sometimes starts to arrive at your table before a waiter finishes taking your order. ',\n",
       "  'Aside from hot pot, only a few cold appetizers are on tap for now: run-of-the-mill mung bean noodles with chile sauce or a somewhat limp cold chicken in sesame paste. Chef Baiguang Han, late of Szechuan Mountain House, doesn’t get to show off his culinary chops as much as his counterpart at Zhen Wei. One exception is a nice platter of braised and chilled meats, a collection that shows off beef shank, duck wings, pig’s ear, and gizzards in all their chewy, snappy, gelatinous glory. That aside, stick to the raw meats and seafood, the nice wines, and the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory scoops of lychee ice cream.',\n",
       "  'Successive waves of gentrification have been pummeling the Bowery since at least the early 2000s, from the Avalon luxury developments and its $3,000-per-month studios to the sprawling clubstaurant that is Vandal, a behemoth that earns its riches by commercializing the street’s artistically populist ethos of yore. ',\n",
       "  'Hot pot spots hawking expensive Japanese beef certainly won’t solve any larger urban problems, alas. But inasmuch as the city continues to change, it’s good to see both older and younger Chinese operators get in on the action, while still keeping things more accessible than their Western counterparts.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Soup base is $5-$6 per person. Meat prices vary per cut. Short rib or beef tongue is $10; prime ribeye is $13; hand-sliced lamb is $16; Japanese wagyu is $80. Most other selections — snapper, Spam, noodles, mushrooms, and blue crab (packed with sweet roe) — run at $10 or less.',\n",

       "  'Bonus tip: Don’t sleep on the precooked spicy shellfish dishes — no hot pot swishing required. Also: Most tables have individual hamper baskets to protect coats and sweaters from the steam and aroma of fragrant Sichuan peppercorns.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Communal hot pots run from $15 (heady pumpkin seafood broth) to $18 (spicy Szechuan beef tallow) to $23 (curated spicy beef tallow with a separate pot of pork bone broth). Combo platters, which do not include soup base, cost anywhere from $45 (chicken, red clam, tilapia, vegetables) to $80 (with Japanese wagyu, short ribs, lamb, abalone). A la carte wagyu is $65.',\n",

       "  'Any acolyte of Gallic gastronomy knows that a fine way to celebrate the unctuous bliss of shellfish is to gel it. Thomas Keller devotes nearly 400 words to the complex technique in his seminal French Laundry Cookbook; the late Joël Robuchon, in turn, practically fueled a worldwide empire with his lobster gelee, setting it in clear jars as if it were a Fabergé egg. ',\n",
       "  'Any adherent of Korean cuisine, however, knows that an easier but no less stunning way to achieve this effect is to throw a few raw crabs in soy sauce, let them marinate for a while, and then eat them raw. This is called ganjang-gejang, and to consume it means to experience the pure, unadulterated jelly of the sea.',\n",
       "  'It’s not a dish that has achieved the ubiquity of uni or fluke ceviche. If you’re enjoying raw soy crab in the five boroughs, odds are you’re dining at a select group of rustic Korean spots. The slithery meat hasn’t regularly found its way onto brasserie shellfish plateaus — or into the city’s thriving community of more creative Korean hangouts. In fact, when South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook visited the Big Apple in 2017, she jetted over her own ganjang-gejang for a dinner in Flushing, claiming, correctly, that its availability was limited in the U.S.',\n",
       "  'Enter Eunjo Park. The chef, who grew up in Seoul, runs Kawi, the most resolutely Korean member of David Chang’s internationalist Momofuku empire. She is here to give us dry-aged steaks, pricey wagyu rice cakes, and a high-profile platform for that crab.',\n",
       "  'She prepares the meat classically, letting female crabs soak in soy before chopping them into quarters. The flesh itself is translucent. It dissolves on the tongue like hot bone marrow — except the crustacean is cold, salty, and sweet, with a delicate tidal whiff. Koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; Park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel. This all begs for crisp sheets of gim (dried seaweed), which are provided for making wraps. But really, the main event here is a singular one, and that is sucking out the meat from speckled oceanic appendages.',\n",
       "  'The raw crab is above; below, Eunjo Park works the pass at Kawi',\n",
       "  'Modern Korean food is New York food — no less so than any pastrami hut, trattoria, Sichuan spot, or South American food hall stall. The movement isn’t dependent on the Momofuku brand for legitimacy; it’s already thriving across the city, at packed venues like Haenyeo, Cote, Oiji, Atomix, Her Name Is Han, Soogil, Hanjan, and too many others to list. But the addition of Kawi to the ranks certainly doesn’t hurt. Indeed, it’s heartwarming to see a superstar operator show up to a $25 billion complex that’s become a bastion of bland steakhouses and use it to represent dishes that are still largely underrepresented, or undervalued, throughout the country’s fine dining scene.',\n",
       "  'Take kimbap, maki-like rice-and-seaweed rolls that are more commonly found at Asian takeout spots. Park goes for a bit of elevation with these, stuffing them with buttery foie gras, torched short rib, and best of all, sweet omelet chunks and dried anchovy. On the side is a two-ounce tin of trout roe to amp up the umami. It’s not cheap at $50, but the mix of salt, sugars, and oceanic oils make it one of the city’s more affordably generous caviar services.',\n",
       "  'New York does not suffer from a shortage of tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), but no one quite prepares a version of this delicacy like Park. She pipes the tteok into a single pinwheel, pan-fries it in chile jam, and tops it off with Benton’s smoky mountain ham. The net effect of this cross-cultural alchemy is a blood-red product sporting the dense chew of a firm steak, the fire of hot wings, and the complex, nutty porkiness of Spanish Iberico. Even amid the city’s crowded Korean scene, Park, who’s worked at Ko, Per Se, and the three-Michelin-starred Gaon in Seoul, makes stunning fare that feels no less urgent.',\n",
       "  'Momofuku, born from an East Village ramen shop in 2004, now boasts 11 restaurants on two coasts, with outposts in Sydney and Toronto to boot. Expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen Nobus across the world. Chang has avoided this conundrum so far. As he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from Paul Carmichael’s Caribbean-Pacific tastings at Seibo in Sydney to Max Ng’s Singaporean-accented dishes at Ssäm Bar.',\n",
       "  'Times critic Pete Wells touched on these themes in a fine essay from last year, but a significant question remained: Would Momofuku be able to keep up the creativity after taking on an infusion of funds from RSE capital? Apparently, yes. Just as Chang has lit gustatory fires in sleepy hotels and casinos, the two restaurants he’s opened in posh shopping centers this year — not exactly paragons of innovation — have been as interesting as anything from his early East Village days. ',\n",
       "  'Kawi has some of the strongest flavors and spice levels of any Momofuku. Park deploys a sweet pepper sofrito to tame the funk of tiny raw clams — but only barely. She sends out spicy tuna kimbap that packs a level of heat more characteristic of a competitive eating contest. But because this wouldn’t be a true Chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, Park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. She tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. At the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top. The layering of crunch, sweetness, silkiness, and slipperiness, all in one bite, with a yuzu perfume to boot, is as good as any Jean-Georges Vongerichten masterpiece. Call it tofu brulee.',\n",
       "  'The setting for these indulgences is nothing too spectacular, and that’s not a problem. Chang has never been about vistas. Kawi is simply a windowless room filled with dark woods, soft banquettes, and classic rock. There is no view of the Vessel, thank goodness, only a view of what matters: the open kitchen, where Park wields a blowtorch with aplomb.',\n",
       "  'The fact that there hasn’t been much debate over Kawi’s prices likely constitutes a minor victory, or a least a dose of hope for a pantheon of immigrant chefs who have struggled with the burden of being viewed as cheap. One of the longstanding riddles of the culinary world is that the chief difference between an order of dumplings and a plate of ravioli is 10 bucks.',\n",
       "  'But things are changing. In an era when Korean tasting menus can command $700 for two, it’s perhaps not surprising that rice cakes, which typically run $13 or so, can scratch at $40 after tax and tip here. ',\n",
       "  'Tableside service is included. A server drops by to dip into your wagyu ragu with golden shears. He takes each tteok, as long as spaghetti, and snips it into bite-sized gnocchi. The creaminess of the cake achieves a symbiosis with the savory meat gravy. Kawi makes its own rice cakes using an extruder; most restaurants buy theirs, and the result is a product that’s softer, lighter, and more tender than elsewhere. ',\n",
       "  'That process costs money, but in an exorbitant mall, it’s worth not overlooking value. Inasmuch as Chang complains about overpriced pasta, most Italian spots are nice enough to do half portions for a lower prices. The giant wagyu ragu could, at $35, could easily be downsized. Same goes for the cakes coated in Parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites. Even the chilled chickpea noodles are expensive by any standard; one dips the firm pasta into a cool pool of sesame sauce, making for an excellent spring tsukemen of sorts. This easygoing dish runs a steep $28.',\n",
       "  'The real deal at Kawi, however, however, is the chicken for four. Park slowly roasts a breast, skins it, and lies it over rice noodles for a warm, comforting feast. In a separate bowl sit all sorts of wings, drumsticks, thighs, and errant pieces of skin. They’ve been fried, sans batter, for a pure chicken crunch. A generous sprinkle of togarashi adds just the right amount of salt and heat. At $67, the dish is easily chicken for two, with enough leftovers for days.',\n",
       "  'There is no printed dessert menu the kitchen uses the power of sound to market its signature sweet. Anyone who sits near the chef’s counter will hear the soft thumping of the bingsu machine, the Korean term for kakigori. The pulsing is soothing and repetitive, not unlike windshield wipers. Ice piles high in a wooden bowl, which a chef squirts with syrup and whipped cream. The flavors here are subtle and almost monochromatic. You dip your spoon into the volcano-shaped dome, retrieve a mass of snow, and let it dissolve on the tongue into pool of warming ginger. ',\n",
       "  'It’s tempting to wish Kawi was literally anywhere else, but if it can act as a calling card for modern Korean, a beacon for tourists who might not have otherwise engaged with it, this restaurant is arguably right where it should be.',\n",
       "  'Cost: About $100 per person or more. Small plates — chicken wings, fried cod with yuzu — are $12 to $17; raw fish is $18 to $34; larger plates, including steaks, rice cakes, kimbap rolls, and stews, run $27 to $60.',\n",
       "  'Sample dishes: Soft tofu with salmon roe, raw clams with sofrito and chile, raw marinated crab, wagyu ragu, chilled chickpea noodles, rice cakes with chile jam and Benton’s smoky mountain ham, boiled whole chicken, bingsoo (Korean shaved ice).\\xa0',\n",
       "  'Bonus tip: Don’t sleep on lunch, the only time to sample the rice cakes with Benton’s ham.

       "  'The sale of foie gras — a fatty indulgence that punches you in the gut, steals your money, and tries to make you feel good about that transaction — will soon be illegal in New York City. Most restaurants, however, won’t have to do much to comply. Force-fed duck livers don’t enjoy as much popularity among young culinarians, a class of hospitality types that turns to nimbler luxuries like uni, abalone, and truffles. In fact, simply encountering foie on a new restaurant menu is somewhat rare.',\n",
       "  'Gotham Bar & Grill is an uncommon establishment in this regard. Foie takes center stage at the famed American venue. This is all the more surprising given that the Greenwich Village fixture, for the first time in 34 years, boasts an ambitious new chef: Victoria Blamey, who takes over from Alfred Portale. ',\n",
       "  'Blamey lets foie show off its sweet side, juxtaposing it against saltier, chewier ham hock. For a more savory affair, she glazes the product with a layer of truffled seaweed gelee, imparting the stomach-distending, main course-sized appetizer with bass notes of earthiness. And in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin. It’s a fine ode to 1996, when Gotham paired this delicacy with guinea hen or squab, or to 2013, when the restaurant featured a trio of simultaneous foie preparations as well.',\n",
       "  'Excess is the point of this extravagance, and Blamey prepares it well. But as a legacy restaurant looks toward the future, perhaps a wallet-busting old-school indulgence shouldn’t occupy so much real estate on a tight bill of fare. And while the poussin-foie is now gone, there’s still something retro about the larger framework of the venue, a contemporary Greenmarket restaurant serving two big steaks and two types of caviar while offering just a single vegetarian main.',\n",
       "  '“In a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, Gotham Bar and Grill is an outlier,” wrote New York Times critic Sam Sifton in 2011. It was, in his words, a restaurant that celebrated “stability and excellence.” And while the owners in 2019 decided to seek change — a claim backed up by hiring Blamey — Sifton’s assessment still largely holds true.',\n",
       "  'Portale, in his early reign, ranked among the most influential and envelope-pushing New American chefs. In the mid-’80s, he acted as an early champion of seasonal, local fare. And more famously, he built dishes vertically, constructing seafood salads as if they were edible Marie Antoinette wigs. But even as Gotham trended more internationalist in the 21st century, its influence waned amid the brash, stripped-down small-plates era of the aughts and beyond.',\n",
       "  'The acquisition of a younger chef, who built a reputation for whimsical and inventive tavern fare at Chumley’s, could have been an opportunity for a full reset. But notwithstanding a touch of high acid here, a bit of Maine uni there, and smart smattering of chiles everywhere, it’s not clear this is truly Blamey’s establishment. Gotham very much remains Gotham, minus any long-faded excellence.',\n",

Morgan’s private wealth management division.',\n",
       "  'On the way to your table, you pass under puffy fabric chandeliers, past a party of five guys (each of them wearing blue-collared button-downs), past three gray-haired men in suits (two of them order the foie), and up and down a few stairs. A waiter is quick to mention they are sold out of the $90 caviar, and can only offer the $140 version.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes the food feels in sync with both new and old gastronomy. The kitchen laces beef tartare with confit tomato, showers it with fluffy gran queso, and tops it off with a wavy tendon chicharon. The layering recalls the altitude of Portale’s architectural tuna tartare, but in a way that’s distinctly, well, Blamey. ',\n",
       "  'But on those rare occasions when the menu feels loose and modern, the service takes a strange and stodgy turn. If a party of three has one man and two women, should a host really ask: “Will the gentleman sit in the middle?” Should servers say things like, “I’ll bring a cocktail list for the lady?” Should a waiter really ask me, the only male at the table, about whether to clear the wine list after a female companion does all the ordering? Should he make eye contact only with me when asking to clear a course? Does Gotham require that certain staffers follow Robert’s Rules of Order (1876) in addressing guests by the third person? If so, Ryan Sutton doesn’t like it.',\n",

Gotham instead sends out dishes that can feel like obligatory concessions to those with dietary restrictions. Beet kimchi ribbons, tomato, and trout roe sit over a pile of stracciatella doing a bland impression of cream cheese. The result is a preparation that tastes like a failed take on a 1980s chevre and beet salad. ',\n",

The dish is simply a bland, mushy mess (though on another visit, it boasts a more complex roundness and tang). Pea dal, in turn, sit in a rich bath of coconut milk and curry leaf oil. It’s a preparation that begs for naan or rice — or really anything to placate the grainy wallop. At Gotham, it comes with nothing. It is simply a thick, gritty, unbalanced stew of legumes, an incomplete side dish posing as a composed appetizer.',\n",
       "  'The good news, however, is that the sole vegetarian entree showcases Blamey at her best.

The dish is a striking blend of starch, smoke, restrained fat, and buzzing savoriness.',\n",

Bollywood movies show at the upstairs bar while thumping club music — not so much the dancing kind as the anonymous variety familiar from a duty-free cosmetics store — fills the dining room. A large group of Elite Yelpers, distinguished by their very cool nametags, are mingling, swirling red wine, and hovering too close to our table. My party has been waiting for the first course to show up, but when a server finally swings by, she brings something a bit less expected: a beverage bill from the downstairs bar. ',\n",

       "  'But a few subtle tweaks make the dish stand out. Cooks lace the fruit with cumin; its sweet musk wafts along the palate. And instead of fried tortillas, GupShup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from Gujarat. And while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. It’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.',\n",
       "  'For “tacos,” Singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. The soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. It conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. You continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of Gramercy.',\n",

       "  'There are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of Indian fare in New York. One of them, which includes venues like Chintan Pandya’s Adda and Hemant Mathur’s Sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from Kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). These venues function to remind New Yorkers that South Asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.',\n",
       "  'Singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. Its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of South Asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. One thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of Rahi in Greenwich Village or the foie gras duck haleem of Baar Baar, a frenetic Bowery space with a Buddakan-style vibe.',\n",
       "  'GupShup, by Indian-born restaurateur Jimmy Rizvi (Korali Estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. It finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist Karishma Naran’s mural of a modern Indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.',\n",
       "  'That means Saturday morning avocado toast. The line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether Singh adds anything to the conversation. The chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. It would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. ',\n",
       "  'GupShup’s ramen is another misstep. That’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a Southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. It’s the execution that’s flawed. The ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.',\n",
       "  'Those mistakes aside, Singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. There’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. Or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. Ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. ',\n",
       "  'But just as Momofuku Bang Bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, GupShup’s own evocation, blending Indian sensibilities with Jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. The puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. The tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of Alka Seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.',\n",
       "  'Or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in Delhi. Vendors typically finish it off with butter. Singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. But somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. ',\n",
       "  'Sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. If the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. ',\n",
       "  'Singh, in short, is taking advantage of New York’s thriving globalism to riff on his ancestral cuisine. And if any of this seems a touch off, kindly remember that GupShup is simply deploying the same whimsical eclecticism as its non-Indian peers, from the American restaurant serving Southeast Asian shrimp toast to the Spanish-leaning seafood spot selling Sichuan-style pig ear to virtually any sports bar anywhere in the city hawking tacos.',\n",
       "  'Singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. The kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. Tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.',\n",
       "  'Singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at Indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. Here at GupShup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. It uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.',\n",
       "  'Beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of Kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of New York restaurants. Maybe that will change after more folks try GupShup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. Nizams haleem, a staple of Ramadan iftar dinners in Hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. The humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. ',\n",
       "  'Too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. It came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. Maybe GupShup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? ',\n",
       "  'Weird things tend to happen here. The host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. When someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” The complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.',\n",

Fig and banana sticky pudding is a study in bland flavors and cold, mealy textures.

       "  'Salmon, in its common New York form, is decidedly unluxurious. Diners more frequently encounter it as a salad protein than as an haute menu item. New York magazine’s Adam Platt once quoted a companion calling it the “Cheerios of restaurant food,” before adding that it was “predictable” and “useless” to critics. In fact, the last time Pete Wells positively used the word salmon in one of his rare four-star reviews was in 2012, when he wrote up Le Bernardin, Eric Ripert and Maguy Le Coze’s French seafood palace in the Theater District.

Tableside, a waiter surrounds it with a moat of veal and beef broth, then spoons black truffle butter over it. A whisper of well-done flesh acts as a counterpoint to the wobbly pink filet; its ample oils channel a mouthful of salmon roe. A dose of broth then brings a rush of meaty, earthy balance.

The more complex reality is that New York seafood has evolved in the 33 years since Maguy and her late brother, Gilbert, relocated their Parisian restaurant to New York. Namely, there’s a heck of a lot more competition now. Milos came along in 1997 with its jet set lavraki and yacht-friendly prices. Marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. And in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination. Scores of tiny bars, many of them in hip downtown locales, cater to a moneyed clientele seeking (endangered) bluefin in all its fatty forms. ',\n",

The cooks sear octopus to a bouncy crunch — nothing unexpected there. Then the flavor station throws in a swatch of mole poblano, a few shoots of cilantro, and a pour of Spanish chorizo sauce.

That miss would likely feel tougher on the four-course menu, where it commands a $50 supplement.

The partying was wild at times, but it never truly devolved into the type of Rich Kids of Instagram debauchery that nearby spots became known for; there were no dance-party brunches where magnums of Champagne came with sparklers or where jeroboams (if you don’t know what that is, you can’t afford one) triggered recognition by the DJ.',\n",

       "  'The outdoor garden at Maison Yaki, a French-Japanese mashup in Prospect Heights, smells of charred meat and fresh wood. Servers ferry charcoal-grilled skewers slathered with sauces that bear names like maltaise and allemande, while the backyard deck radiates the pungency of sunbaked cedar. Two humans in shorts play pétanque, an old Provençal game similar to bocce. They take turns throwing steel balls, politely raking the gravel after each round, sometimes hitting the back wall where tiny strings of lights intertwine with creeping vines. And then, after a few minutes, a bearded host invites them back in for dinner.',\n",
       "  'On this evening, Maison Yaki is only a Slip’n’Slide short of qualifying as summer camp. And yet, the backyard acts as one of the most civilized waiting rooms in New York. ',\n",
       "  'Fans of Olmsted, a garden-equipped sister spot across the street, know a thing or two about waits and reservations. Maison Yaki, a casual spot where literally every dish falls under $10, improbably boasts some of the same inconveniences as Olmsted, giving away its best tables a month in advance; the only availability three Saturdays from now is at 10:00 p.m. But the little secret is that the kitchen serves the full menu out back. Waiters balance the crispy beef tongue katsu sandwiches on ledges, right by the two pétanque courts. ',\n",
       "  'As I wait for a friend one evening, I order a skewer of king trumpet mushrooms a la greque; the namesake lemon-wine sauce brightens up the meatiness of the fungi. At this point, the sky is starting to darken, and I’m cooling off with a fragrant yuzu gin & tonic. In this era where even an informal dinner can be planned with the precision of a Google Calendar invite, and secured with the threat of a Resy-backed financial penalty ($25 per person here), it’s nice to simply walk into a joint and eat standing up while playing alcohol-fueled lawn games.',\n",
       "  'A patron plays pétanque; a spread of dishes',\n",
       "  'Chef Greg Baxtrom, late of Stone Barns, has himself another winner here in Prospect Heights. And the good news is that the wait to dine indoors is much shorter here than at Olmsted, thanks to a 50/50 split between walk-ins and reservations. Kitchen counter seats overlooking the smoldering charcoals, or bar stools underneath the mini-indoor mushroom farm, turn over reasonably quickly on weeknights. ',\n",
       "  'Evenings here trend more affordable as well. Draft cocktails, including wonderfully strong Manhattans and martinis, cost $9. A full meal for one — two small plates, five skewers, two drinks, tax, and tip — will run about $80, versus $115 or so at Olmsted. That’s not cheap anywhere, especially not in a neighborhood where the median household income hovers around $62,000 per year. ',\n",
       "  'But relatively speaking, the prices are reasonable enough for a style of cross-cultural dining that doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the city. Maison Yaki is a cross between a French bistro and a Japanese yakitori spot, and most of the time, it’s a darn good one at that. ',\n",
       "  'For traditional rillettes — confit meat in a jar — a thick cap of white fat helps preserve the slow-cooked proteins. But in the fanciful world of Maison Yaki, a layer of wasabi-ginger foam, doing its best impression of lard, sits above a mound of shredded duck leg. The frothy tweak cuts through the poultry funk with finesse.',\n",
       "  'The history of French-Japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. Most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. Joël Robuchon’s chain of L’Ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. And oodles of modern Japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.',\n",
       "  'But yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. Their cuisines are more codified. That doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. A bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-English names. The same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.',\n",
       "  'What’s particularly clever about Maison Yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. Snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. Baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. Chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; Baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and Franco-style braised artichokes.',\n",
       "  'Chicken breast nuggets are typically paired with wasabi at yakitori spots. Here, Baxtrom douses the little bites, whose stunningly squishy interiors recall ripe grapes, in sauce allemande — essentially Thanksgiving gravy.',\n",
       "  'This isn’t contemporary globalism; this is classic fusion. Almost every Japanese-leaning dish has a striking French accent and vice versa. And the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. A Korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an American steakhouse. A pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. And a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. The lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which Baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce Americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest Gallic seafood soups.',\n",

This is not unexpected for a young venue. Cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. Watching a senior yakitori chef (or Uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. They tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.',\n",
       "  'The binchotan station at Yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. Gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. Baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. The sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. The squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss. Well, except when the meat is overcooked.',\n",

       "  'Skewered pork belly arrives hidden underneath a foamy dijonnaise, adding just enough tang to balance the richness of the swine. If only the swine exhibited the silky fats and crispy flesh that normally make pig belly so compelling. These are simply firm, hot cubes of meat. ',\n",
       "  'One might logically ask about all the offal that typically define the modern yakitori spot. For now, items like gizzards and hearts only appear as specials, which is too bad because those off-cuts and viscera provide something that Yaki could do better with: texture. ',\n",
       "  'The variegated mouthfeels one experiences at venues like Tori Shin — thanks to snappy knee bones and rubber band-like arteries — help break up the fact that you’re essentially eating a whole lot of hot, fatty meat. Baxtrom’s old-school saucery, which harkens back to the era of Careme and Escoffier, serves a similar purpose, which is to achieve a sense of balance. But still, it would be nice if more of the skewers exhibited more than the soft or faintly chewy textures that dominate a meal here. ',\n",
       "  'There are worse verdicts, of course, than chomping down on a pillowy duck meatball. The kitchen doesn’t lace it with tiny bits of bone, as is the norm; the fluffiness puts it closer to an Italian meatball than a Japanese one. You dip the succulent poultry into a ramekin of soy and what looks like yolk. Turns out the egg is really an avant-garde sphere of fruit puree that pops with the poke of a chopstick. “Duck a l’orange,” the menu says. Very cool. Equally cool is Yaki’s rare textural masterpiece, two chicken wings on a skewer. The skin shatters like the top of a creme brulee, while the silky flesh underneath yields with more ease. ',\n",
       "  'This is the appropriate way to end a meal here. Baxtrom didn’t initially employ a pastry chef at Olmsted, an omission he managed to pull off thanks to a masterpiece of frozen yogurt. And while there’s now a chef dedicated to sweets, the team hasn’t yet found that killer finisher here at Yaki, so for now you can skip the mealy Japanese cheesecake or run-of-the-mill profiteroles.

       "  'To observe the flattop at Au Cheval, the New York spinoff of Brendan Sodikoff’s Chicago burger palace, is to witness black steel turn pink. The cooks here do not tend to verdant asparagus or springtime ramps; rather, they traffic in flesh, blood, and marrow. Beef patties and pork belly cover the griddle with such density that an intrepid cat could walk across without burning its paws. It is a carpet of meat. An Angus rug that sizzles. These burgers are why otherwise rational humans subject themselves to an inordinately long wait before dinner. ',\n",
       "  'The Tribeca hotspot offers two optional toppings: a fried egg and a layer of pepper bacon — the kind that’s cut so thick it could stand alone as an appetizer. Those add-ons are for those who want, to borrow the words of a waiter, “the Instagram burger.” ',\n",
       "  'I want no such thing. Twenty minutes later, my server sends over the standard model: two seared patties. They boast a handsome maillard char and a midlevel bovine punch. American cheese — or as I like to call it, yellow salt — folds itself into the brown nooks and crannies. This all goes into a golden brioche bun slicked with dijonnaise. It is a tasty burger. Then again, there is no shortage of tasty burgers in New York. That’s worth keeping in mind when a host says it’s going to be 90 minutes before you sit down.',\n",
       "  'Also worth keeping in mind: The signature item runs $27 with fries, placing it firmly within gourmet burger territory. Add the suggested toppings and you’re at $35, which places it alongside the DB burger as one of the city’s priciest. But while Boulud’s truffle- and foie gras-stuffed specimen is a veritable act of expert charcuterie, the Au Cheval burger, with all the fixins, is a gloppy, runny, everything-falls-out-when-you-bite-it expression of American junk food. It’s not quite in the same league as its peers.',\n",

Sodikoff, who made his New York debut with the ultra-exclusive 4 Charles Prime Rib (good luck getting a reservation before 11:45 p.m.), bills this as a diner. If that truly were the case, it would heed the cue of MeMe’s or Gertie’s, two venues that seek to rethink that dying form with a mix of nostalgia, generosity, and egg creams.',\n",
       "  'Sodikoff’s use of the term feels more ironic than honest. Is “diner” really the right description for a venue that books up between 5 p.m. and 10:30 p.m.? Where a host says “we’ll text you,” rather than invite you to hang out in the downstairs bar? Where the lighting is as dim as at a nightclub? Where food isn’t delivered as platters with sides, but rather ordered a la carte, as at a steakhouse? ',\n",

The single burger comes with two patties and the double comes with three. Fried bologna is piled as high as a mini kakigori. Vegetarians don’t have much to work with here, save a not quite palate-cleansing green salad, a grilled cheese sandwich, or an omelet stuffed with too much chevre. Herbivores can also pretend the fries aren’t crisped in beef fat. ',\n",

That said, here’s what to order and what to avoid. ',\n",
       "  'Chilaquiles: Traditionally, the dish consists of tortilla chips simmered in salsa. That much is true here, except Au Cheval stacks everything high and adds sour cream, guacamole, egg, and jalapenos.

This isn’t a study in contrasts, but rather an essay in amplification; the eggs enrich the sauce, while the sauce adds salty, umami oomph to the eggs. The only thing that’s out of place are the knobs of foie gras, which are overcooked and only serve to pump up your bill. The cost is $28.',\n",
       "  'Root beer float: This concoction is more of a parfait, with interspersed layers of ice cream and soda.

In any case, cooks slather the nuggets in mornay and duck gravy. This would be a reasonably nourishing dish at a roadside diner in, let’s say, Montana, after a long day of skiing and hunting elk.

Most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal Romanesco, also undercooked; and Brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. The notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash.

A few minutes later, as I was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “Wow, they nailed that.” He went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television.

It’s as if someone tried to chat with you during the key plot twist of Jordan Peele’s Us at the movies. You don’t get to hit rewind.

He doesn’t cross-hatch it like some, or jazz it up with citrus like others. He simply presents it as a slick study in the color white — wearing an invisible cloak of sweet soy. The cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an MSG-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess. The rice, while still distinctly tangy, is a touch less vinegared than at Noda. It is more “one” with the fish, rather than distinct.',\n",

And yet here was comedy’s T-shirt-and-jeans everyman talking about one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with O’Brien admitting he’d been there too. Sandler even mentioned the owner’s name, Thomas Keller, the American godfather of the $1,000 meal.',\n",

One of his top waiters penned a celebrated memoir about the nightly wizardry at Per Se.',\n",

Journalist Jodi Kantor argued venues like Per Se contributed to spendier $40 mains across the country. ',\n",

That dish is the $100 entree. A single dish for one.',\n",

It doesn’t even exhibit a particularly notable juiciness or beefiness. A spokesperson for the restaurant said the Snake River farms cut should rank from a 9 to 12 on the Japanese scale of marbling, which is about one would expect from ultra-expensive wagyu.

But is it any better than the more complex roast at Smith & Wollensky, whose dry-aging imparts a nice Roquefort zing? It is not. Is the service better here?

Nine brilliant courses will outweigh four misses. With a shorter three-course meal, though, the chef has just one shot at that main course. And the pain of that single large dud is multiplied when the price is double what it should be, a scenario that occurs too often at TAK. The $100 main that’s “just okay” functions less like a psychological barrier that diners need to overcome, and more like an income test: Those who can’t afford it don’t belong.',\n",

It belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. Harry Cipriani is the classic example, while TAK, alongside neighboring Estiatorio Milos, are the more modern ones.

Steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. Tableside Caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or Parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. It is cold lettuce with dressing. The $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. Black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. The texture is sludge.',\n",

       "  'The farmhouse pork pate recalls supermarket ham wrapped in old bread. The twice-baked comte souffle forgoes ethereal silkiness in favor of grittiness.

       "  'Electric Lemon is a very good restaurant designed to attract a clientele of fitfluencers, or at least those who dream to be. It claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy Brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, Pop Rocks. The venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own Instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. Another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. This is, to be fair, all what one might expect at Hudson Yards’s Equinox Hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.',\n",
       "  'A lobby host asks if you’re checking in. Maybe you are — if you’ve got $2,000 to spend on two nights. Most folks will instead take an elevator to the 24th floor. There, among the normals, scores of people who look like cutouts from Men’s Health are brunching. Arms bulge through artisanal sweatshirts. Lean torsos jut up like slender tree trunks through drawstring hoodies. A guy in a Patagonia-style vest wears AirPods throughout his entire meal, even while complaining about his eggs. ',\n",
       "  'The kitchen stuffs squishy breakfast sandwiches with heady chicken sausage and pairs them with side salads instead of home fries. Christ.

Among them: Dolph Lundgren and some tech VP.',\n",
       "  'Things seem dire until the apple cider doughnuts arrive. They’re rare yeast versions of the autumnal treat, normally made in the cake variety at farmers markets. They shimmer from a light glaze, smelling of cinnamon and wet earth. Their texture is bouncy and their flavor is only faintly sweet. Herein lies the surprise of Electric Lemon. Those who look past the GOOP-y branding and weekend DJs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. At least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise Mid-Atlantic fare. ',\n",

       "  'The dining room at Electric Lemon overlooks Hudson Yards.',\n",
       "  'It is difficult to consider Hudson Yards without understanding its larger missteps, particularly the fact that the entire compound functions as a taxpayer-subsidized bastion for the rich. But one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the Vessel. Electric Lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off Midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. ',\n",
       "  'Here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the Bank of America building, the New Yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the Hudson River, and the sun setting over the Jersey City Heights. Here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped Vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.',\n",
       "  'Even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. Try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. Chef Kyle Knall (Maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. As the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. This is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. Knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. A touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. For more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.',\n",
       "  'But for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. Knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. But he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.',\n",
       "  'Much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. Chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. Equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. The flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. It all makes for stellar DIY tacos.',\n",
       "  'If the the beet-yogurt “Beauty Bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the New American style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. For example: Knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. It’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. ',\n",
       "  'Labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by Equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. Still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. Clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-Western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. It’s curious how, at Electric Lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in Hudson Yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots. Also: When a restaurant posts a photo of someone holding a cocktail while their cephalic vein bursts out of their forearm, that effectively signals the type of bodies that belong here, and those that don’t.',\n",

Next to them, she places frozen spheres of lemon curd. She arranges this all in such a way that channels a faraway solar system, where the orbital bodies are made of sugar and colored in pastels. The sorbet is soft and fragrant; the curd is firm and bracingly sour; and the Pop Rocks, more audible than visible, vibrate across the tongue like a soft electric current. ',\n",
       "  '“Moon Rock” exhibits no fewer complexities. The chef showers a soft ball of chocolate in dense, black sesame feuilletine and honeycomb crisps, resulting in an amorphous mass that tastes like a cross between a Butterfinger and a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup. And since any nut butter calls for dairy, a quenelle of goat’s milk ice cream helps unstick the palate with a kick of barnyard funk. ',\n",

       "  'No dish, except possibly the dosa, is as popular as biryani in Jersey City’s India Square — a two-block stretch of Newark Avenue that descends from Kennedy Boulevard to a tangle of highways on the edge of the Meadowlands, and a three-block hop from the Journal Square PATH station.',\n",
       "  'Six restaurants in India Square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. It’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to India with the Muslim Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of Lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern India, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of Hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.',\n",
       "  'My favorite place to score biryani in India Square is currently Biryani Darbar. Over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear. The menu offers a breathtaking 15 biryanis, but don’t prepare yourself for a visual extravaganza: If set side by side, they wouldn’t look all that different. ',\n",
       "  'I’ve tried 10, and all arrived in a deep, bone-colored bowl heaped with brown, white, and orange rice, surmounted by a boiled egg, cilantro, and a few rings of sweet purple onion. Each vessel was voluminous, enough to satisfy two or three diners.',\n",
       "  'Don’t be fooled by the uniformity of appearance: The biryanis here taste distinct, though subtly so, presenting a swath of styles. The variations originate both in Hyderabad and in nearby Vijayawada, two cities where a tooth-and-nail competition over biryani has been raging.',\n",
       "  'Some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the Hyderabadi style. The flagship of this fleet is Hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. Break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern Indian biryanis.',\n",
       "  'Other versions of the Hyderabadi style deploy goat, mutton, ground mutton, shrimp, Indo-Chinese chile cauliflower, paneer given a smoky flavor by being pre-cooked in the tandoori oven, and boiled eggs. The egg version makes a particularly good brunch dish along with a cold beer on weekend afternoons, when Biryani Darbar’s dining room fills up with shoppers who have come from all over northern Jersey to buy South Asian groceries, sweets, and jewelry.',\n",
       "  'The final three biryanis on a menu created by owners Fahad Kolani and John Sehpur, plus chef Ravi Rajendran, are attributed to the Vijayawada style, and you can tell the minute you look at them because the rice is darker and richer tasting. The one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern India. “But it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” Kolani cautions. “It’s more of a green pickle gravy. It shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern India.”',\n",
       "  'Finally, when the version known as Vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. Though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, Vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the Hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices. (Kolani — a Jersey guy who grew up with Hyderabadi parents — explains that Vijayawada biryani involves mixing pickled ingredients and pungent gravies into the rice at the last minute to make the flavor more intense.)',\n",
       "  'That said, Biryani Darbar has a much more ambitious menu than just its eponymous dish. The bill of fare includes several Indo-Chinese recipes, a full selection of tandoori-baked meats, and northern Mughal vegetable standards like saag paneer and aloo gobi, in addition to a slew of specifically Hyderabadi specialties. Street-food staple chicken majestic ($10.95) is one of those, coarsely shredded and breaded poultry in a lively yogurt sauce colored bright yellow by turmeric. It could become your favorite fried chicken.',\n",
       "  'The menu is also loaded with vegetarian stuff, including gutti vankaya, baby eggplants with a stuffing of coconut, peanuts, tamarind, garlic, ginger, and assorted spices. The filling tends to escape and threatens to drown the eggplants. Is this a defect? Not really, because as with southern Mexican moles, the sauce is the thing — the more the better. Another intriguing vegetarian dish is methi malai muttar ($9.95), which finds peas dunked in a forest-green fenugreek sauce. If you’ve ever wondered what fenugreek tastes like, this is your best chance to find out.',\n",

       "  'One of New York’s most exciting new dishes originates from the street vendors of Dalat and Ho Chi Minh City. There, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. This bánh tráng nướng, or Vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in Orange County, California, home to one of the country’s biggest Vietnamese populations. But it’s been largely unavailable in New York.',\n",
       "  'That changed with Di An Di, a Greenpoint Vietnamese restaurant from Texas-native Dennis Ngo. When it opened, Ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. ',\n",
       "  'But the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of Vietnam and its American diaspora, debuted something a bit different in December.',\n",
       "  'Ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic Vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. And then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. The crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. The clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. ',\n",
       "  'The chef says the flavor combinations are true to Vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of Northeasterners: a New Haven-style bivalve pie. The menu lists it both as a Vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants Di An Di as a modern Vietnamese-American restaurant. And it’s an excellent one at that.',\n",
       "  'Long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over Chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist Tu Mo had a few smart words about Vietnamese soup. “Don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author Andrea Nguyen. Mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist French rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of Paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.',\n",
       "  'Nearly a century later, Vietnamese spots pepper the Parisian landscape. And even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in New York, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. Few would consider it humble — especially not at Di An Di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than Gallic consommes.',\n",
       "  'It would be just as absurd to call the restaurant humble. Patrons of all stripes line up two hours for bánh xèo — a dosa-like turmeric crepe filled with a warming blend of shrimp, pork, and mung beans; the starchy mixture is bland at first, but a quick application of fish sauce brings the component ingredients to life. ',\n",
       "  'Other diners might reserve weeks in advance to gnaw at wonderfully chewy fried pig tails, sticky with tart tamarind chile sauce. They cleanse their palates with icy vodka highballs, redolent of lemongrass and bergamot, while sitting near neon-green lights and hanging plants.',\n",
       "  'The plant-filled bar room and dining room at Di An Di',\n",

       "  'New York’s largest flow of Vietnamese immigrants came following the fall of Saigon in 1975; many of them eventually settled in Elmhurst and Flushing, which along with Chinatown still boasts one of the city’s most notable clusterings of phở and banh mi spots. But just as a new class of Korean and Chinese restaurants are popping up around the city, a younger group of Vietnamese venues are making a name for themselves as well, pushing past tradition and the burden of being cheap.',\n",

',\n",
       "  'Di An Di’s operators are second generation; Ngo and Kim Hoang were raised in Houston, home to the country’s third-largest diaspora community, while Tuan Bui hails from Northern Virginia.

       "  'That means diners can expect chicken over rice, a staple dish in Houston, where it’s normally steamed Hainanese style. Di An Di instead fries the birds, letting them crisp up without any batter. The soft meat and golden skin taste like a mathematically engineered bird: poultry to the power of 100. To amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.',\n",
       "  'Bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of Lone Star Vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare New York appearance here. Strands of rice paper, as wide as tagliatelle and as thin as tissue, act as springboard for a tart jolt of pickled papaya and a salty crumble of beef jerky. It is a perfect cold noodle salad.',\n",
       "  'Lucky guests might also encounter a steamed, grilled, and deep-fried short rib. Ngo says the “entire reasoning” for this special, which packs a powerfully earthy beefiness, was to show off an even more flavor-packed product: mắm nêm. He softens the blow of that famous elixir, forged from whole fermented anchovies, with pineapples, chile, and lime juice. Patrons wrap the beef in the lettuce, then dunk it in the mắm nêm, which has a stunning umami-rich pungency that more or less makes it the durian of steak sauces. ',\n",
       "  'And of course there’s the spring roll, a dish so ingrained in Stateside culture that one can find them, for better or for worse, on a Cheesecake Factory menu. At Di An Di, the flavors seem to sing more brightly than elsewhere. The tamale-sized rice wrapper folds around a fistful of mint and basil, while a pile of shrimp and squid mimic the flavor intensity of a langoustine. ',\n",
       "  'New York’s modern Vietnamese menus are often quite focused in their soup offerings. Hanoi House offers a riff on leaner Northern phở — little more than broth, stretchy rice noodles, fish sauce, and filet mignon — while Madame Vo reps the lusher and more common version from the South, fragrant with cilantro and accompanied by a plate of basil, jalapenos, and sprouts. ',\n",
       "  'Di An Di, by contrast, acts as an outlier in selling both. Cooks cover the Hanoi phở in scallions, adding a touch of perfume to the intensely beefy broth. And they serve the sweeter Southern version with a plate of basil and sprouts for tearing and infusing. Giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen also puts out an estimable phở ga (chicken), with a clean poultry tang and a resinous hit of rau ram, as well as a strikingly nuanced bún bò huế, a crimson-hued soup heady with beef, shrimp paste, sweet lemongrass, and bouncier, thicker, firmer noodles.',\n",
       "  'Best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. Patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. This ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes Di An Di a Vietnamese analogue of sorts to Ivan Ramen, one of the few Japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. Diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.',\n",
       "  'Ngo says he plans to tweak the Di An Di formula as it matures, perhaps introducing a late-night program — along the lines of Ssäm Bar in its 2006 days, where Tien Ho served some of the best Vietnamese-American fare the city has ever seen. And he’d also like to revisit dessert, which was nixed after an early effort to keep the tables moving. In other words, the chef is ensuring Di An Di can do what virtually any modern American restaurant serving any type of food needs to do to remain relevant: adapt and evolve. ',\n",

       "  'Coulibiac, the Russian fish pie, captured plenty of imaginations more than a century ago. In an 1871 short story, the great Russian author Anton Chekhov wrote that the dish should “make your mouth water, it must lie before you, naked, shameless, a temptation. You wink at it, you cut off a slice, and you let your fingers just play over it.” Legend has it that Auguste Escoffier learned how to prepare coulibiac in Nice while cooking for Russian naval officers early in the 20th century; he subsequently included the recipe in his famous Guide Culinaire, using salmon instead of sturgeon. By 1972, New York Times critic Craig Claiborne, in a meditation on “list-making,” declared it the world’s greatest dish. ',\n",
       "  'Yet despite 100 years’-plus worth of raves, coulibiac is almost completely unavailable in the city’s top restaurants. Veronika, Stephen Starr’s impossible-to-get-into and occasionally excellent Eastern European-leaning establishment, is here to change that. ',\n",
       "  'Located on the second floor of the Fotografiska museum on Park Avenue South, Veronika is a self-proclaimed grand cafe. Triple-tiered chandeliers hang from 20-foot ceilings. Intricate stained glass adorns a gilded lounge. And beautiful people wear jackets at their tables without putting their hands through their sleeves, a sartorial choice that makes it look as if they’re auditioning to eat cake in a chic Austrian perfume advert. It is the type of ornate, pre-crash environment one expects for a grand dish like coulibiac, which the waiter brings out on a white plate with elaborate gold etchings.',\n",
       "  'The coulibiac has three layers: a pink interior of salmon, a thinner ring of rice, and a crisp pastry casing. The kitchen plates the dish as a cross-section, so every component is visible. A pool of Champagne sauce and trout roe spills across the plate.',\n",
       "  'Its look is distinctive: One Instagrammer thought it recalled the Wu-Tang symbol. Another compared the appearance to “alien lungs,” while adding that they wanted to do something to the dish that I would euphemistically describe as “horny.” Yonic or not, it is an exceedingly tasty dish. The salmon is pudding-like in its texture, while the rice tones down the oceanic oils with starchiness and a jolt of lemon. The exterior is appropriately crispy, and the roe adds precise bursts of brine. The clean flavors and declension of textures suggest that in the pantheon of all the world’s great savory pies — from Bolivian saltenas to Moroccan pastillas to French pithiviers — the coulibiac, particularly at Veronika, is no less deserving of a seat at the table.',\n",
       "  'Veronika is a departure for Starr. Over the past six years, the prolific restaurateur has focused his New York offerings on modern American, British, or Western European fare (there was also El Vez, his Mexican endeavor from early 2014). His latest establishment, however, bills itself as a grand European cafe that’s “romantically reminiscent of Eastern Europe at the turn of the 20th century,” that gilded era before two World Wars and an Iron Curtain would devastate and divide the continent.',\n",
       "  'A culinary yearning for the past tends to play well in these Trumpian times; one thinks of the Grill or Anton’s. And Starr also happens to be filling a hole in the city’s modern dining scene. Veronika is Manhattan’s only high-end Eastern European-leaning restaurant. Kachka in Portland is a national sensation, but tony Manhattan restaurants — or even everyday brasseries — don’t really draw from the cuisines of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, or the Balkans for their upscale fare. That’s a shame given the deliciousness of those traditions, not to mention their historic use of fermentation, pickling, foraging, and other techniques and ingredients trending in the modern culinary world.',\n",
       "  'Chef Robert Aikens, who helped open Starr’s Pastis, brings some of these sensibilities to Veronika. The improbably named classic known as “herring under a fur coat” is often a hefty, nourishing terrine molded in a casserole dish. Here, it looks and tastes like a zingy dish one might encounter at a hip neo-bistro. The chef hides slivers of ultra-oily fish underneath thin slices of puckery beets, while a grating of eggs gives everything the smooth mouthfeel of edible mink. Or with pork-laced borscht, Aikens imparts the classic soup with just a touch more acid than elsewhere, reining in the sweetness of the beets with cider vinegar — while also adding the requisite sour cream, which bleeds into the red broth and gives it a faintly pink hue.',\n",
       "  'Aikens also draws his inspirations from Austria and France, and in one case brings in a rare Gallic delight from the United Kingdom: soufflé suissesse. The great Roux brothers created the dish in 1965 for London’s Le Gavroche. The suissesse is a paradox: an airy dome of eggs drenched in mornay — that emulsion of bechamel and gruyere that’s the heaviest known drinkable liquid in the universe. The wicked-hot soufflé vanishes on the palate, while the cheese sauce never seems to disappear, enrobing the tongue with its luscious fats and alpine funk.',\n",
       "  'Like other dishes at Veronika, the suissesse adopts a khaki palette. This is neutral-hued food that stands in contrast to the extravagant room. Even lobster Americaine, with its sweet, crimson meat, takes on the faded tones of an old VHS movie. It’s as it should be for such a throwback dish, whose chief pleasure is in mopping up the rusty shellfish reduction with rice. ',\n",
       "  'And then there is the study in white and off-white: three bone-colored pierogies filled with creamy potatoes and paired with sour cream. An inconsequential dollop of caviar vanishes into the background. Are the $17 dumplings any more refined than the $7 ones at Veselka, the everyday East Village hangout? Not really, but sometimes it’s nice to have rustically excellent fare in a fancy establishment. Not everything needs to be poured through a sieve 800 times to qualify as high-end.',\n",
       "  'Those pierogies, however, prompt a larger question for Veronika, which is whether it’s trying too hard to make a cafe, a purportedly democratic institution, into an exclusive one. For the most part, it’s not necessarily a question of price, but rather access. Dining here requires month-ahead planning. There are no tables set aside for walk-ins, nor is there bar dining. It’s a style of unapproachability that’s only slightly more understandable at Starr’s fancier temple of Gallic gastronomy, Le Coucou. ',\n",
       "  'Those who simply drop by for a drink at Veronika, like my colleague did recently, will find that the entire space is reserved for folks with a booking, meaning the joy of people-watching and taking in the gorgeous room is verboten (folks without bookings are sent to the downstairs chapel bar). It’s hard not to wonder: With ceilings high enough to accommodate a few Gulfstream private jet fuselages, could Starr not have found room for a bar with more than six seats, so a few more impromptu patrons could enjoy a drink here — or a bite?',\n",
       "  'This approach to dining feels tilted toward an older moneyed class who want to know precisely where they’ll be eating their roast duck a month from today, and who want to guarantee that even an a la carte meal will be a theatrical, 90-minute experience. If restaurants like Momofuku, Estela, or Wildair represent the prevailing style of dressed-down, downtown, small-plates places, Veronika recalls one of those uptown prix fixe white-tablecloth spots from 2003 where every meal was three to four courses, and where the reservationist was your chief barrier to entry.',\n",
       "  'Hence the boring black cod, preternaturally crispy but slathered in a monochromatic butter sauce, and the perfunctory snails in garlic butter. There’s also the requisite tuna tartare, filet mignon, and Dover sole. Given the ubiquity of those dishes around town, it’s hard not to wish Aikens instead highlighted more regional fare with less representation. Then again, given how rarely one encounters the opposite — you don’t see Balthazar slinging pelmeni — the more generous assessment is that Veronika is the outlier, expanding the concept of what a pan-European menu can look like. ',\n",
       "  'For those who can motivate themselves to care about eating these types of things 30 days out, Veronika is uniformly excellent. For those who can’t, there’s a more casual cafe downstairs that sells turkey on pretzel rolls. Perhaps the Starr team will at least start offering some of Veronika’s cakes in that space, particularly the medovik, a riff on the Russian delicacy that layers golden-brown cake with honey chantilly icing — instead of the traditional sour cream (verdict: It tastes about the same). Muscovites often pair it with tea in the late afternoon, and I have no doubt that when Veronika opens up for lunch, taking an impromptu trip here for a slice of the soft, heady tort will be easier.',\n",
       "  'Price: At least $100 per person for a three-course meal with wine, tax, and tip. Starters run $18 to $26; mains are $27 to $54; desserts are $14 to $16. Caviar service starts at $115.',\n",

My server suggested a few dishes on the Asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” It was a curious statement. I hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness. The waiter simply felt the need to warn me, preemptively, that a signature preparation was garbage.',\n",
       "  'So I did what any other normal diner would’ve done. I ordered them.',\n",
       "  'Three little empanadas, filled with marinated beef, arrived minutes later. I winced as I took a bite. Chefs infuse the meat with inhumane levels of sugar and salt; if the kitchen had any sense of balance, the meat might be accompanied by kimchi or lettuce wraps to keep the seasonings in check. Instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. It turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. ',\n",
       "  'In place of classic bulgogi, diners are treated to a veritable Frankenstein of a dish, an unholy triad recalling microwaveable Hot Pockets, airline Korean food, and hospital-quality Welsh rarebit. The bartender asked me how I liked them.',\n",

Cooks and waiters sauce dim sum themselves, as if they were omakase sushi chefs priming each morsel for perfection. The unfortunate result is that the dumplings turn to mush.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes hosts don’t greet you because they’re staring down at their phones.

At least I got to search my pseudonyms!',\n",
       "  'If there were anything to get truly excited about, it was that Wild Ink marked, for a brief time, the New York return of Tien Ho. When it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than Ho, whom Wild Ink’s London-based parent company, Rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. The chef helped bring David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing Korean, French, American, and Japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. He followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at Ma Peche and Montmartre. And then he suddenly left the world of day-to-day cooking, taking corporate gigs at Whole Foods and Morgans Hotel Group.',\n",
       "  'The scene at Wild Ink, plus lamb momo and mapo tofu dumplings',\n",
       "  'At Hudson Yards, his official title was culinary director for Rhubarb U.S., the local outfit of the British-based group famous for its insipid restaurants and catering venues. Just as his old boss, Chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, Ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. He had been working for “several months” with the Wild Ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, Rhubarb and Ho announced they were parting ways. It just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” Ho said. The fact that Wild Ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.',\n",
       "  'Take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef Peter Jin. The point of this Sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. Jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. The wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.',\n",
       "  'The mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. The same can be said about General Tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to Heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the Cantonese-American staple.',\n",
       "  'There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fusing diverse cuisines, experimenting with classics, or upscaling rustic preparations; Ho was once a master of this. These techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. ',\n",
       "  'But the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. It’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, Instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or Cheesecake Factory.',\n",
       "  'Like, did Jin really have to fry bulgogi and mapo into “this-won’t-stain-your-shirt” finger food? Does a shumai dumpling really need so much bacon that you can’t taste the overcooked shrimp? Does cold Chinese celery need to be turned into yet another bland “add-seared-tuna” salad? Is it not completely mental that this is the only restaurant serving Chinese food in a brand-new neighborhood?',\n",
       "  'Perhaps most frightening of all is that Wild Ink appears as crowded — if not more so — than Chang’s much better Kawi on any given night, with revelers knocking back bland matcha vodka mules and munching on celeriac root skewers as undercooked as raw potatoes.',\n",
       "  'If someone does drag you here, the beef tartare is simple and excellent, with cool chunks of beef lit ablaze with hot mustard. Crab rangoon boasts a clear shellfish aroma and a remarkably light fry. Yuzu risotto is a smart bet, too. It’s a simultaneous ode to Japan and Italy, with the citrus cranked up to levels so insane that one could sell this dish as a scented candle. And yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. It’s a loud, beautiful creation.',\n",
       "  'And roast duck is passable enough, if you can make do with the dry confit leg and sinewy breast with under-rendered fat. That’s not quite a compliment, but the preparation is more forgivable than the scallops with dal. One could imagine a genius pairing here, with the kitchen juxtaposing the creamy, earthy lentils against sweet, caramelized scallops. Alas, Wild Ink plates such gritty legumes that they inadvertently act as an ode to the sandiness of poorly cleaned shellfish. ',\n",
       "  'Rice pudding, too, does little for the palate.The grains, hidden under slices of mango, have been cooked into mush and chilled into a flavorless chokehold. Pineapple upside-down cake, in turn, is simply a fine, forgettable riff on the midcentury classic, with ginger ice cream tempering the fruit’s sugars.',\n",
       "  'Wild Ink poses more questions than it answers: Did Ho simply not monitor Jin closely enough? Had he lost touch with the city’s changing culinary scene following his absence? Did the Rhubarb folks issue a cruel clubstaurant food mandate, arguing they’ll sell better with the mall crowd? Will things be this mediocre when the next Rhubarb spot opens at the Hudson Yard observatory? Whatever the answers, let me end by paraphrasing the words of my honest bartender: I can’t recommend that you eat here.',\n",

       "  'Ambitious modern sushi is typically a very specific thing in New York. That is: a traditional and expensive omakase parlor hawking exquisitely butchered fish, much of it endangered bluefin, over vinegared rice. Sushi at Llama San in Greenwich Village, however, is a very different thing. The stunner of a Peruvian spot offers just a single type of nigiri, forged from duck, cilantro, and fried banana.',\n",
       "  'There is no chef standing solemnly behind a counter, doling out pristine morsels piece by piece. Chef Erik Ramirez simply sends his creations into the blonde-wood dining room, where Fiona Apple’s “Criminal” pipes through the sound system. A staffer walks to and fro waving burning palo santo sticks, blessing the space with pungent smoke. ',\n",
       "  'Four nasturtium leaves, so green they’re practically glowing, seem to hover above the plate. Under each one lies the sushi: a mound of coriander rice below a sheath of paper-thin duck breast. The perfume of coriander hits the palate first, then the savoriness of the rice, then the the earthy essence of aged waterfowl. And just when the gaminess starts to creep up, the banana, tucked between the grains and the bird like a pat of wasabi, issues a whisper of sweetness. ',\n",
       "  'This is sushi that’s as worthy of critical contemplation as any toro hand roll. And while Llama San offers an omakase that runs $500 for two after drinks, the duck nigiri is only available a la carte, for $24.',\n",

       "  'What Ramirez is doing at Llama San, however, constitutes a branch of Andean cuisine with less obvious (if growing) stateside representation. That style of cooking is called Nikkei, a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the South American country’s culinary ethos. Scores of Japanese people emigrated to Peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to U.S. internment camps during World War II.',\n",

       "  'Anyone who’s been to a Nobu has encountered some form of Nikkei. Its chef brought worldwide fame to tiradito (sashimi) with rocoto chile paste and filet mignon with zippy anticucho sauce. But while Nobu has turned into a blandly internationalist chain that bills its food as Japanese, Llama San proudly calls itself Nikkei, exhibiting a deeper level of virtuosity in the style.',\n",

He douses crimson cubes of tuna in ponzu; they seem to pulsate with the nuclear level of soy and yuzu. He pairs fried Iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. And he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an Andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. The mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.',\n",
       "  'His tofu acts as an essay in the colors yellow and white. A rectangular block of soy curd covers a mash of shrimp mousse, while a golden pool of garlicky seafood sauce imparts warmth. Rice crackers hide a pile of tender lobster, displaying a charcoal-grilled singe, and smoky chunks of corazon — no gamier than skirt steak. It’s a surf and turf like no other; the shellfish jus and beefy heart drippings, fortified with oregano and vinegar, enrich a serving of sushi rice underneath.',\n",
       "  'Hand rolls are not uncommon in Nikkei cuisine, but the way Ramirez prepares them is. He takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. Tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. The combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.',\n",
       "  'Ramirez has emerged as the city’s most studied and satisfying purveyor of modern Peruvian in all its diverse forms. He serves up beef corazon skewers at Williamsburg’s Llama Inn; shrimp noodles and rotisserie birds at Llamita in the West Village; and now, at Llama San, a compact menu of creative and visually striking small plates. ',\n",
       "  'Most people in the dining room will justifiably only order off of the a la carte menu. But Llama San also offers a $150 omakase, a rare South American tasting in New York.

       "  'The meal kicks off with a bite of kaluga caviar between two crisps. The kitchen could have easily let the roe stand alone; instead, it’s paired with a swatch of miso manjar blanco — a South American dulce du leche of sorts. Purists might recoil at this combination, but the mix of oceanic brine and aromatic sugars is simply a perfumed riff on a sea salt-laced caramel.',\n",
       "  'Ramirez also sneaks in an off-menu oyakadon, a Japanese chicken-over-rice bowl, which he crosses with estofado de pollo, a Peruvian poultry stew. For this, he uses gizzards. Japanese restaurants love to highlight the snappy texture of the digestive organ, but Llama San takes a more rustic tact, braising them until they’re barely firmer than a chicken nugget. The little knobs, which flaunt just an inkling of poultry funk, sit sandwiched between an egg omelet and a layer of rice. The flavor profile recalls sweet tamago sushi crossed with rich sausage.',\n",
       "  'Does one need a hefty plate of wagyu short rib after six previous courses? Probably not, and perhaps Ramirez should consider showing off his stronger dishes, like the surf and turf or Iberico, instead of ending yet another Manhattan tasting menu with this ubiquitous luxury. That said, Llama San sends out an impressively beefy cut, fortified with what might be the world’s greatest potato salad, which is laced with bites of squishy egg and tiny, sweet shrimp.',\n",
       "  'Ramirez operates with just as much skill at dessert, showering an undulating blob of custard with Fanta-colored satsuma ice and halved gooseberries. The combination speaks to its component flavors: the egginess of the cream, the cool citrus punch of the granita, and the rampant acidity of the pulpy fruit. I ask the waiter if it’s based on a Peruvian dessert. She responds that it’s based on a creamsicle. Right on.',\n",
       "  'Older, fancier tasting spots cap off dinner with a flurry of petits fours. Llama San instead offers a single bite and a shot of booze: a matcha truffle infused with muña (Andean mint) and a few sips of pisco. The candy’s dusty exterior boasts a tannic astringency, but that bitterness quickly yields to a soft, buttery, grassy interior. The accompanying liquor parries the sugary blow. ',\n",
       "  'A restaurant doesn’t need to send out a mignardise to qualify as “fancy” or “good,” but inasmuch as the wagyu crowd considers this sort of thing as a signifier of luxury, Ramirez and company are arguing that they can tango with the best of them. Indeed, they can.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Most dishes in the $20s and $30s. Expect to spend about $100 per person or more for about three to four courses for each diner. The tasting runs $150 and must be booked in advance.',\n",

       "  'Farida claims to be “the first and only Central Asian cuisine in the heart of Manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. As long as two decades ago, Kosher Uzbek restaurants such as the legendary Taam Tov flourished in the Diamond District, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. I’m not kidding! Though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. ',\n",
       "  'Much more recently, quick-service Central Asian places have popped up, such as Kebab Empire in Hell’s Kitchen, which calls itself Uyghur cuisine. But what Farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service Central Asian restaurants are in places like Sheepshead Bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping Casios like Palmyra, Kaifuem, and the original Nargis, which cater to Central Asian and Russian customers and specialize in banquets.',\n",

But the couple opted for the Midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” Gabbassova-Ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.',\n",

Murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. The servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.',\n",

Elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. Not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. Carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on Farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of Samarkand.',\n",
       "  'The fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. Make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: The same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.',\n",
       "  'That brings us to the kebabs. Here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for Central Asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout Russia in the 19th century. Like Argentines and Texans, Central Asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. Lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at Farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. Get fries or naan bread on the side.',\n",
       "  'The chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.',\n",

       "  'What’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many NYC Indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. The problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. Adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.',\n",
       "  'The same incredible paneer constitutes a focus of the menu. Have it in chile paneer tikka ($7). Here, a spicy red sauce has been painted on the grilled squares; they tumble onto the plate like paving stones. Less exciting is paneer khurchan, which tosses the fresh cheese with peppers in a tomato sauce that obscures the cheese’s delicate flavor. ',\n",
       "  'While a few Indian restaurants focused on regional cuisines have incorporated pork (prevalent in Goa and Karnataka) and beef (a Keralan favorite) into their menus, Adda sticks with the standards of chicken, lamb, and goat, which pertain in most restaurants here and in India. Lamb is showcased in one special, a hulking ground-meat seekh kebab ($13) that’s an especially good deal if volume of meat is your objective.',\n",
       "  'But the best dish among a dozen meat and poultry choices is a goat curry called junglee maas ($18), or “wild meat,” a reference to people cooking what they hunt. Goat curries, of course, are ubiquitous at Punjabi steam-table restaurants throughout the city, often in stunning renditions. Adda, though, one-ups even the best of them with the junglee maas. The bones are left in, as they should be, and the gravy is at once fiery and pungent. If you love goat, this curry will drive you crazy and leave your tongue burning. Other standards of top steam-table restaurants are produced here in even better renditions too, including a butter chicken so rich it boasts streaks of actual butter on the surface.',\n",

And though meat shines here, vegetarians will find plenty to love on Adda’s bill of fare, including globular lotus-root kofta akin to croquettes that rest in a tomato sauce laced with fenugreek, and a tandoori-cooked cauliflower topped with a layer of Amul, a processed cheese based on cheddar that’s in the same family as Velveeta. My mom would have loved it. ',\n",

       "  'Not too long into dinner at Red Paper Clip, an Asian-leaning tasting-menu spot in the West Village, a server brings over an ash-colored plate decorated with white swirls of yogurt and scattered herbs. “Carrot katsu,” he says. This is unusual, not just because this breadcrumb-enriched cutlet is typically made with pork or chicken, but rather because this style of Japanese cooking isn’t frequently seen at a bastion of expensive eating — unless it involves a fat slab of luxurious wagyu. ',\n",
       "  'The katsu packs a deeper, denser crunch than a more cloud-like piece of tempura. The exterior, however, quickly yields to a softer orange interior, at once vaguely sweet and savory. Those swirls of yogurt, in turn, add a soothing tang, while shiso oil conveys a minty, licorice-tinged perfume. ',\n",
       "  'On a good night, it easily ranks as one of the better katsu dishes in a town, and it shows that a more rustic Japanese dish like this one is just as deserving of a place on a tasting menu as a slice of blow-torched tuna neck. On a bad night, however, the carrots are undercooked and cloying. The aroma of the shiso is flat. And the conversation ends there, a disappointing conclusion to an exciting idea. ',\n",
       "  '“These are black truffles from Oregon,” a waiter announces a few minutes later, shaving them over something dubbed xiaolongbao agnolotti. It’s a cross between the Italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the Shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. You pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. It never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. ',\n",
       "  'And at $95 for the tasting, the price isn’t too shabby either.',\n",
       "  'The two-month-old Red Paper Clip, an uneven solo debut from Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. One is about a duo of Blue Hill at Stone Barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. As sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. ',\n",
       "  'Contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while Luthun in the West Village and Reverence in Harlem represent newer entrants to the field. And while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to Red Paper Clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. The people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.',\n",
       "  'The presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of China. Chen, a native New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, and Gyamtso, who was raised in Tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Himalayan ingredients with those from France, Italy, Japan, and elsewhere. That’s no small matter. While a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, Chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as Korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.',\n",
       "  'A waiter shaves black truffles over XLB agnolotti.',\n",
       "  'Tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.',\n",
       "  'But the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. A restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. And inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that Chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their Western (or Japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see Chen and Gyamtso prove folks wrong.',\n",
       "  'There are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. Corey Lee’s Benu in San Francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while Kato in Los Angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other Taiwanese delicacies. But in New York, an expression of Chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of XO sauce here, a dab of indiscernible Sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.',\n",
       "  'It’s for this reason that one might scoff at Red Paper Clip’s Sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. A sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. Then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. Slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. And finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. Visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an Estela or a Wildair, but its DNA feels Sichuan through and through.',\n",
       "  'Then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. It’s just another carpaccio.',\n",
       "  'Here’s simplicity at its best: Chen and Gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. This infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. Things are quite lovely. Until they’re not. During another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.',\n",
       "  'Therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of September. Underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that Chen and Gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. Red Paper Clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. ',\n",
       "  'Or consider the lobster three ways. There’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. The butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. And the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. Mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.',\n",
       "  'That criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. They have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. Occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. An act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. But it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. ',\n",
       "  'The late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. The kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. These “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. Whimsical moments like these suggest that Red Paper Clip will eventually find its groove. For now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.',\n",

       "  'The most exciting meal of Julia Child’s life, by her own account, was a 1948 lunch of Dover sole meuniere. Served at a small auberge in Normandy, the fish came in a “sputtering” butter sauce, while the delicate flesh exhibited a “light but distinct taste of the ocean,” she wrote. Nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of European and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era. Wait captains normally debone the fish tableside, pair it with a restrained sauce, and sometimes toss in a few capers.',\n",

       "  'One wonders what Child would’ve thought of the version at David Chang’s slyly thrilling Momofuku Noodle Bar in Midtown. Alongside the porky ramen, chickpea soft serve, and frozen banana daiquiris, there is a Dover sole that has evolved — or devolved — a touch more than others. It is neither delicate nor pretty. ',\n",
       "  'No tableside service here. Patrons watch as cooks, under the aegis of chef Tony Kim, unceremoniously griddle the sole, pressing a weight against it for a hard sear. Waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. The flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. It doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. It is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. ',\n",
       "  'The cost is just $43 here at the Time Warner Center, home to the city’s densest collection of offensively priced restaurants. It’s as if Chang is saying: “We can cook with the same obvious luxuries as our neighbors, do more with them, and charge less.” Not bad for a chain restaurant on the third floor of a shopping mall. ',\n",
       "  'Chang, who rose to celebrity status as an expletive-spewing chef bent on dressing down fine dining and subverting culinary traditions, is not an empire builder in the typical sense. He doesn’t Xerox fine dining temples like the late Joel Robuchon or overpriced steakhouses a la Wolfgang Puck. Almost all of his sit-down concepts are genuinely unique, from Seiobo, a Caribbean-Australian tasting counter in Sydney, to Nishi, an Asian-Italian pasta place in New York, to Majordomo, an haute-rustic hotspot in Los Angeles. ',\n",
       "  'But Noodle Bar — along with his Fuku fast-food outlets — appears slated for interplanetary replication. Chang runs three of them, in the East Village, Time Warner, and Toronto, or arguably four, as the Las Vegas Momofuku borrows heavily from the chain’s repertoire of ramen, pork buns, and fried chicken. ',\n",

Across from a Bose Store, a J.Crew, and a bland brasserie — a commercial cul-de-sac that’s barren after 8 p.m. — Noodle Bar teems with life. The long bar, cramped booths, and open kitchen evoke a packed 24-hour diner. Patrons dunk squishy Hot Pocket-shaped buns into pools of jus; it is a French dip for the future, with the muscular beef concentrate magnifying the oomph of the soft brisket stuffing.',\n",

Noodle Bar commands a more reasonable $28 for fried chicken buns, where the crispy meat gets a saline kick from a generous shower of smoked trout roe — a break from Noodle Bar’s $500 version of this dish that has heaps of black caviar. No, it’s not the same thing, but since many can only afford one of the above, the adaptation is an important one.',\n",

Kim shaves a flurry of the fragrant tubers over hozon soft serve, a soy-free analogue to miso. The flavor is pungent at first, then salty, then sweet. It is, like so many other dishes here, an axiomatic argument against the exclusionary pricing that pervades so much of this shopping center.',\n",

       "  'The majestic smoked pork ramen — identical to the East Village original — tastes like what would happen if a cook accidentally left a bowl of spicy swine broth next to a barbecue pit. It doesn’t have the same mouthfeel as a richer paitan, but the sensation is akin to slurping up al dente noodles slicked with liquid bacon.',\n",
       "  'Garlic chicken ramen, in turn, conveys salty warmth, with cubes of rotisserie thigh packing a lot more flavor than the neutral, egg-enriched broth.

Skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. But from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. The chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. This is unexpected. ',\n",
       "  'Indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. Its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to Dutch to Middle Eastern to Indian to Polynesian to Chinese. But broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. It’s a style of cooking New York restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the Standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at Nargis. ',\n",
       "  'And yet at Wayan in Nolita, due to fire code issues, the team executes this Southeast Asian staple via a European-style griddle. The skewers do not suffer from the adaptation. ',\n",

Pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. And sticks of Florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ',\n",

       "  'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, this is the type of restaurant one might have expected from Cédric’s father, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the Franco-American chef who shook up New York gastronomy in the late ’90s and early aughts. From his eponymous Central Park flagship to his clubby Spice Market in the Meatpacking District, he drew upon his days cooking in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong to fuse Asian sensibilities with Continental fare. He flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier Midtown venues. The flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.',\n",
       "  'That style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at Wayan. Cédric, a Bangkok-born chef who also runs Perry St, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. You roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.',\n",
       "  'Particularly breathtaking is sop buntut, Javanese oxtail soup. The broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. On the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. Fancy French chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. And that’s precisely what Cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm Maillard char.',\n",
       "  'Really, if there were any fears about whether Wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the New York restaurant world. The prevailing Jean-Georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to Asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland East-meets-West menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. ',\n",
       "  'Such fears are not entirely unwarranted. Vong Kitchen in Jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” Cédric and Jean-Georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the Wayan menu. There’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in Nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any Nobu or Robuchon in Moscow or Tokyo. There’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. ',\n",

With so many brilliant Southeast Asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why Wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the American country club variety. Make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. But still, it’s disappointing that Cédric, instead of trying to introduce New Yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. ',\n",

Pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of Twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk.

Over 130 staffers tend to fire-spitting grills, butcher whole fish, turn entire mackerel into tartare a la minute, and carve up turbot tableside in mere moments. To dine downstairs at Milos Wine Bar, however, is to witness a very different ballet, and arguably a more compelling one. ',\n",
       "  'Just two or so chefs prepare every item on the much shorter menu. They slice raw tuna and anoint it with yuzu kosho. They lay a sinuous octopus tentacle on a wicked-hot grill. They drizzle Madagascar prawns with olive oil. They shave succulent pork off a rotating spit for gyros. ',\n",
       "  'For this four-course feast, plus two glasses of wine, tax, and tip, you pay just $88. That much wouldn’t buy you half a lobster pasta upstairs at dinner.',\n",
       "  'I had strong words for Estiatorio Milos shortly after it opened, and again today. No matter how grand (or average) your Mediterranean-tinged meal there might be, you always feel cheated. ',\n",
       "  'Milos Wine Bar is the less opulent endeavor. There’s no view of the Vessel or the Hudson river; the space simply overlooks the mall’s empty interior. But the wine bar is also the more affordable and generous concept. Not a single item rises above $16. That octopus the chef was grilling evidences as much technical expertise as other business-class cephalopods around town. There’s that purplish exterior, like a crisp baguette with suction cups; the middle layer of gelatin, ever-so squishy; and the meaty interior, firm and juicy. All that’s missing is that gas grill “kiss” from upstairs. Here it’s $10. There it’s $32. ',\n",
       "  'Taramasalata, a Greek feat that takes briny cod roe and olive oil and transforms it into a product that’s silkier than hummus, is only available as part of a trio of spreads upstairs. The cost? Thirty-nine dollars. Here, it’s available alone, with warm pita, for $10. ',\n",
       "  'Everything about the wine bar is an axiomatic argument against the absurd pricing of the main dining room.',\n",
       "  'This includes the wines themselves. Milos upstairs offers 11 whites by the glass, more than half of them at $17 or more. Getting ahold of a waiter to order one (or a cocktail) sometimes means eating through half a $100 entree, sans beverage. But the wine bar downstairs offers at least 30 whites (and 37 reds) by the glass, with the bulk below $15; a few hover just below $10. Every selection is Greek, a bonus in a city where Hellenic wines don’t get the representation that they deserve.',\n",
       "  'It’s also a rare menu to offer meaningful tasting notes, detailing the rose-petal notes of a Greek moschofilero (whose high acidity will cut through a sausage like a knife through butter) or the tropical aromas of a malagousia (whose medium tartness doesn’t obliterate the subtleties of raw tuna). The bartender will also offer pre-purchase tastes by default, a courtesy I didn’t encounter upstairs. ',\n",
       "  'There’s a certain irony about the whole setup: The wine bar can offer the type of service and wine selections one might expect from a fancy chef’s counter tasting, while the massive 240-seat dining room, where dinner for two can easily run $500 or more, is more akin to an economy class experience. ',\n",
       "  'That’s the Milos money machine. If you’re a millionaire many times over, and you know precisely what to order, upstairs can be a party. Otherwise, the right move is to hang out down here. Here are a few notes on the menu:',\n",
       "  'Spanakopita: The classic Greek pie, a blend of spinach, feta, and phyllo. The component flavors are stellar; the greens and feta express a vibrant sourness. But the pastry is stale.',\n",
       "  'Madagascar prawns: The $16 single-shrimp version of the larger $39 starter upstairs. The prawn oozes dark, heady juices when the head is removed. Suck out what you can and use soft pita to mop up whatever’s on the plate. The crustacean is cooked masterfully; the salty flesh packs a welcome chew and a midlevel maritime tang.',\n",
       "  'Bigeye tuna: A fat slice of raw tuna on a cracker. The product is unnervingly cold, but the fault feels less egregious at $10, versus the nearly $40 option upstairs. The condiments are louder and brighter here too, with an uppercut of dill and yuzu kosho making a higher-volume, more palate-whetting amuse.',\n",
       "  'Scallop skewers: Just three mollusks on a stick. Here, they’re barely cooked through, exhibiting a precarious balance of scallop sweetness, griddle sting, and maritime brine. ',\n",
       "  'Keftedes: Veal meatballs, plain and simple. The wine bar serves them at room temp, letting the piquant, perfumey dill minced into the meat to express itself with aplomb. These aren’t ultra-juicy balls — they’re easygoing, chewy, fragrant snacks. Consume with beer.\\t',\n",
       "  'Loukaniko: Just a big griddled Greek sausage. It’s everything one might expect, a chubby link that’s crisp and snappy on the outside and juicy and herby within.',\n",
       "  'Gyro: At $8, it’s not too much spendier than the streetside version. It was a whisper dry on a recent visit, but that didn’t detract from its overall complexity, porky crispness contrasted against slippery tomato and rich yogurt. Add a hint of hot sauce and you have one of the city’s better gyros.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Small plates at $16 or under, with many dishes at $10 or less.',\n",

       "  'Amid New York’s ever-globalizing culinary scene, a culture of cross-pollination continues to thrive. The city’s finest barbecue shack sells not just Texas brisket but stellar jerk pork. An ambitious Indian spot in Gramercy sends out pitch-perfect tandoori chicken — and guacamole to boot. An Asian rotisserie in Midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox. And now at Haenyeo, a knockout of a Korean hangout in Park Slope, the kitchen whips up bouillabaisse as masterful as that of any Gallic temple. ',\n",
       "  'Chef-owner Jenny Kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic French soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and Pernod. The rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. A filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in Marseille — glutinous rice cakes. Mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. And then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen. The warmth of the stew doubles the urchin’s natural sugars and triples its musk. ',\n",
       "  'At this point you might search for the traditional bouillabaisse accompaniment of croutons with rouille to add a bit of garlicky cream and crunch to the stew. Except there’s none of that here. Kwak instead presents a baguette slathered with seaweed butter. Let it soak in the broth, then appreciate how the sweet nori enriches the mixture.',\n",
       "  'If that’s still too European, Kwak offers more traditional dishes too, from bulgogi to raw fish bibimbap bowls — alongside with Mexican-leaning fundidos and Louisiana-style shellfish. Haenyeo might take its name from the women who free-dive for seafood off of Korea’s Jeju Island, but its approach to cuisine is often decidedly and unabashedly internationalist.',\n",
       "  'Park Slope’s collection of Korean restaurants is still small, which is fitting. That country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of East Village representation there before Kwak and her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. The duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s Korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd Street. The mother-daughter team opened up Dok Suni’s on First Avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.',\n",
       "  'Writers praised their efforts, though they sometimes used language that should’ve come across as troublesome then, as it is now. New York Magazine’s Fran Schumer began her Suni’s review with this slight: “You’d rather have spaghetti than kimchi any day, but there are times when cold pickled cabbage tastes that good.” ',\n",
       "  'New York Times critic William Grimes lauded Kwak’s use of tasting menus to “demystify” Korean food at Do Hwa in the West Village. “For years the city’s Korean restaurants made no concessions to newcomers, who faced a struggle figuring out what the dishes were, how to order them and how to eat them,” he wrote in 2000. ',\n",
       "  'Food will always adapt, but pointing out a particular cuisine’s so-called lack of concessions or instructions is a dicier affair. That said, the Korean restaurant community has evolved over the decades — as have the journalists covering it. It’s been ages since a reviewer has used the word “forbidding” in association with any of these fine venues, or (unnecessarily) mentioned that the waiters “speak English well.”',\n",
       "  'Korean fried chicken is about as ubiquitous as any other style. A certain galbi-slinging barbecue spot in Flatiron is harder to get into than any local steakhouse. A multibillion-dollar real estate complex is selling ’grammable rice cakes shaped like pinwheels. And late last year marked the debut of Haenyeo, whose kitchen exhibits a stunning fluency in alternating between more traditional and more modern, fusion-y preparations. ',\n",
       "  'There’s something profoundly warming about walking past a bustling Al Di La, the Italian pride of Park Slope, and noticing that Haenyeo across the street is no less packed. Miles Davis pipes through the sound system as families eat fried scallops with corn tartare — an “is-it-summer-yet” melange of oceanic and terrestrial sugars — and scallion pancakes; the slices of spicy onion are held together with so little batter they’re effectively modernist tempura sculptures. ',\n",
       "  'The corner space, with handsome brown floor planks, French-style bar stools, and ample natural light, screams neighborhood cafe, and that’s partly the plan. Haenyeo will open for lunch and brunch this summer, serving up coffee and eggs with “jambalaya rice.” For now, it’s dinner only, with a no-reservations policy for most party sizes. The wait on Saturdays can surpass 90 minutes.',\n",
       "  'Anyone who tries the oysters will understand the pulsating crowds. Kwak grills them over hardwood briquettes, a hat tip to the New Orleans heritage of her husband, Terrence Segura, with whom she shares ownership. She’s not the first person to do this in New York, but she might be the most skilled. The Wellfleet bivalves display an aggressive plumpness; they pop with a gentle press of the tongue, gushing with hot seaweed butter.',\n",
       "  'Equally stunning is the rustic-internationalist take on fundido, typically a glorious gut bomb of melted cheese. Here, that ingredient constitutes just the epidermal layer of a deeper, bubbling casserole. Beneath the scorched cheese, an aggressively milky Oaxacan variety, lies a pool of chile sauce and mounds of tteokbokki, oblong Korean rice cakes. Pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface. The combination of flavors and textures — chewy rice cakes, hot peppers, tart sauce, spiced sausage, and stretchy, melty cheese — feels like less of a true fundido and more of a Korean-Mexican riff on baked ziti. ',\n",
       "  'Then, a moment later, Kwak switches gear to modern-refined fare. She serves ordinary grilled mackerel in a very distinct way, by pairing it with square sheets of nori. The mackerel is soft and neutral, boasting gently smoky overtones. It’s borderline boring until you wrap it in seaweed, which imparts the fish with a hint of brine and a crisp, snappy texture. You dunk the hand roll, a striking contrast of white and green, in crimson gochujang paste, lighting up the palate with salt and sweet chiles.',\n",
       "  'The menu has a few minor misses, from run-of-the-mill beef kimchi gyoza — ordinary fried dumplings — to a bland mound of chile-braised tofu. Better are the puffy fried chicken bites laced with jalapenos, as well as the Korean seafood stew, a smaller, more classic answer to the fancier bouillabaisse. The soup, chock full of silky soybean curd and firm shrimp, is milder in flavor than the spendier French version, sporting just a touch of shellfish concentrate. And then there is the classic soy-and-sesame-marinated ribeye bulgogi, cut paper-thin and piled high on a platter for wrapping in crisp lettuce and shiso leaves.',\n",
       "  'Louisiana-style beignets are the appropriate way to end a meal here. The dough itself is relatively unsweetened, giving the confections the taste of a classic street-fair zeppole. So much powdered sugar is applied that you will inhale some as you eat. ',\n",
       "  '“Not Korean” is the disclaimer that Kwak appends to her Instagrams of that dessert. “For me, staying true or preserving Korean flavors is the main goal,” the chef writes in an email. But she adds that “there are so many influences around me, mostly from traveling but even from living in NYC,” that she allows herself more room to experiment than she did earlier in career. May she continue to do so.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Starters at $9-$16; larger share plates at $16-$34. Seaweed baguette is a (worthwhile) $6 supplement to the $29 bouillabaisse.',\n",

       " ['The Riddler and Air’s earn two stars apiece for their accessible bubbly selections and stellar food',\n",
       "  'My general advice for caviar coincides with my maxim for top-shelf Champagne: Don’t order either at restaurants. The only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of Dom Perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. To truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. It needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. A sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like Air’s by Ariel Arce or the Riddler by Jen Pelka, two Village wine bars that make caviar and Champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.',\n",
       "  'There’s something particularly fancy about dropping by Air’s, located in a bustling MacDougal Street townhouse. Green palm fronds rise up from the marble bar. Red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. Teal lights shine behind cases of wine. And diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. Caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. But here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. Baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. The beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. ',\n",
       "  'And just as cookies call for milk, caviar necessitates sparkling wine to gently scrub the palate of all the oceanic salts. Air’s can help in this regard, offering six Champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. At the Riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. True, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.',\n",

       "  'As the new decade approaches, Manhattan feels more and more like a museum gift shop of basic-level fanciness: money, finance bros, Tetris-like skyscrapers on Billionaires’ Row, wagyu-laden steakhouses, and bluefin-hawking sushi dens. That’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. Mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.',\n",
       "  'Air’s and the Riddler rank among those venues — sort of. The interventionist methods used to produce Champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” But the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. ',\n",
       "  'Arce and Pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower Champagnes or other progressive wines. What makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like Krug and Billecart-Salmon to spendier bottle selections.',\n",
       "  'Despite their commonalities, these are two very different venues: The Riddler, which debuted in San Francisco, hawks airy Zalto stems on its website, while Air’s sells discount caviar on its site. Composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at Le Bernardin make up the bulk of the Riddler’s food menu, but Air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. One of them is très bougie. The other one is less bougie. Both are quite good.',\n",
       "  'Shortly after opening, Air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. That translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “Our goal is to expose as much Champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” Arce, a Hell’s Kitchen native, told Eater a few years back. Accordingly, a Jacques Lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “Queen Bae Beyonce Chardonnay,” per Air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.',\n",
       "  'Like Terroir in Tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. It explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. Air’s is correct here: The faint sweetness in the rose Champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. And whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a J.L. Vergnon Murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.',\n",
       "  'Shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. The pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. The eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from Southern U.S. waters. The delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. ',\n",

       "  '“We want to be a neighborhood spot that people can come to a couple times a week. That’s why we’re doing a burger,” Riddler’s founder and owner Jen Pelka told Eater NY this year, adding: “But we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” It’s possible, of course, that Pelka has a Silicon Valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. My first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of Champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.',\n",
       "  'Here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “Ask a sommelier for a 100 Club Scorecard to track all of the bottles of Champagne you try,” the document reads. “Those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a Riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” That proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from Starbucks to Sweetgreen, has a rewards program. ',\n",
       "  'But since there’s just a single bottle of Champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club. That all sounds about right for a dining room with a gold-leaf ceiling.',\n",
       "  'The Riddler, by any yardstick, is expensive. Then again, the haute-sparkling-wine stratosphere operates by its own ridiculous value equations. At any ambitious American or Gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of Champagne for less than $30, so the fact that Pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. Among those fizzy wines is a Gonet-Medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit LaCroix.',\n",
       "  'With beverages like this, chef Nikole Morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single Champagne. It’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. But Morsink, formerly at the Modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.',\n",
       "  'Take the king crab. So many restaurants fall back on serving the regal crustacean as is, in its own shell. Morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. The result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.',\n",
       "  'Shrimp cocktail gets a salt-and-pepper treatment, leading to a pile of barely-cooked-through shellfish with a sharp, saline punch. Roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, French. Morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. Think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of Noel Bazin brut rose ($25). ',\n",
       "  'White truffle risotto, at $42, will count for some as an unaffordable extravagance. But in this realm of luxury dining, it’s a heck of a deal when versions of the dish can command $135 or more. Each creamy grain snaps with an al dente bite, a whiff of brown butter, a punch of Parmesan, and the ephemeral pungency of pricey fungi. ',\n",
       "  'Caviar is reliable and not too spendy. The large-beaded kaluga variety ($78) sports a soft texture and mild seafaring flavor; discard the chips and creme fraiche, which overwhelm the delicate eggs. Better is the faux dessert roe. Pot de creme arrives in a round tin, affirming the venue’s nouveau-patrician leanings. Crunchy chocolate balls and bitter caramel sit over a layer of salted and sour vanilla creme fraiche. ',\n",
       "  'The Riddler is far from the first restaurant to serve pretend caviar, but it might rank among the most adept; the mix of crunch, saline punch, and astringent sugar makes the frequently leaden dessert feel light, complex, and whimsical. It costs just $11, which suggests bespoke desserts are undervalued with regard to widely available wines. No matter. It’s a modest price to pay to spend another 10 minutes or so on a chic corner of the West Village, with giant windows overlooking a leaf-strewn Bank Street.',\n",

And he makes a Mont Blanc to end all Mont Blancs. Spaghetti-like swirls of chestnut cream surround a base of creme fraiche chantilly — nothing out of the ordinary there. But at the base is a mound of candied chestnut, an unusual addition that adds a warming, chewy savoriness. And on top of the tiny “mountain” is another twist: a dollop of yuzu-yogurt sorbet, cutting through the sweetness. ',\n",

Alas, in the past few years, New York has seen Blue Box Cafe, which sells a $32 “Breakfast at Tiffany” inside the jeweler’s flagship, and La Mercerie at Roman and Williams Guild, where hosts advise guests to browse a store selling $16,000 couches.',\n",
       "  'The self-proclaimed purpose of Intersect, which also has locations in Tokyo and Dubai, is to act as a “unique, permanent space in select global cities where people can experience the ethos of the Lexus lifestyle without getting behind the steering wheel of one of our cars.” It’s not a mantra that screams “restaurant” or “hospitality.” ',\n",
       "  'Perhaps this is why everything feels a little different here. Bathrooms lie behind two sets of space-age sliding doors; toilets come equipped with heated seats. Cool. Anyone who uses those restrooms must pass by that SUV — not to mention a video installation showing sleepy b-roll of that car. It’s... less cool. And since Lexus supports “local and international artisans as they develop their trade,” a retail area sells $350 sunglasses and a reinterpretation of a soccer ball for $410. ',\n",

A restaurant should foster a sense of community. The community defined by Intersect feels like a sterile world dreamed up by a wealthy baby boomer from the suburbs. It feels built for aging Lexus owners, with the sound system piping out Billy Joel, Petula Clark, and Jackson Browne.',\n",

Marchand is one of the leading members of the French bistronomie movement, which generally favors small plates (or tasting menus) in casual, affordable-ish settings.

       "  'In the West Coast meat world, few names carry the import of Belcampo. Anya Fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. She achieves such nobility through vertical integration; Belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert Temple Grandin. According to a New Yorker feature titled “Can Steak Save the Planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. The grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” The company even holds O magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. ',\n",
       "  'Belcampo’s East Coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into New York’s meat scene. It is not. The restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of Hudson Yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. ',\n",
       "  'The concept is admittedly a welcome one here in Hudson Yards, a development where a single ribeye can run over $100.',\n",
       "  'Belcampo is where you go when you don’t have a reservation elsewhere or when the family is with you. The dining room piece de resistance is a giant glowing sign above the bar that says “BELCAMPO.” It is a very branded ambience.',\n",
       "  'This does not seem like the Belcampo Jonathan Gold once wrote about. The late, great, Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. Other West Coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. There are no such wonders at the Hudson Yards Belcampo. This is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. This is shopping food. ',\n",
       "  'The standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. Grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; I recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. Belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. Virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. ',\n",
       "  'The progressive farm-to-table ethos does not extend to the beverages. Anyone pairing their beef with a nice red will encounter a fairly generic cabernet, pinot, or syrah. It will be served warm. You will not see the bottle, never mind get a pre-purchase taste. There are no funky orange whites to pair with any of the sustainable fare.',\n",
       "  'Still, there are some gems. When it opened, Fernald said that she expected most of her customers to be people who live and work at Hudson Yards. If you’re one of those people — or if you’re someone who simply ends up at the mall without a reservation — here’s a rundown of what to order and what to avoid. ',\n",
       "  'Tartare or carpaccio: These are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. The carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. Flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. The meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. As for the tartare, it’s better than Thomas Keller’s more luxe version at nearby TAK Room. Neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. Most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. ',\n",
       "  'Duck poutine: Fries get slicked in beef gravy and topped with crispy bits of duck thigh here. The flavors seamlessly align with their component ingredients. The meat is gamey. The fries are crispy — until they turn gorgeously soggy near the bottom — and the gravy is umami-rich. The cheese curds are firm and clean, providing a respite from all the salty, nourishing goodness. ',\n",
       "  'Chicken Caldo: This is a nourishing and affordable soup. For $12, you get a giant bowl of poultry bone broth laced with lime and tinged with warming achiote. Heady forkfuls of shredded thigh meat float alongside big slices of avocado.',\n",
       "  'Tallow Fries: This $12 side comes fried in either duck fat or beef fat. Neither, however, exhibit the multilayered flavor profile of a proper tallow fry. They’re just run-of-the-mill, above-average frites, crispy on the outside and fluffy within.',\n",
       "  'Merguez sausage: Juicy and smoky, the sausage boasts a clean snap. A solid $8 side.',\n",
       "  'Lamb burger: This is the only good burger here ($16). The lean meat isn’t as rich or silky as the famed Breslin version, but that also means it’s easier on the digestive system. Each bite provides a medium punch of salt and funk, while alfalfa sprouts impart a touch of pleasant grassiness. Just one problem: The cooks apply so much drippy aioli that the bun instantly turns to mush. ',\n",
       "  'Satay chicken salad: This includes smoky grilled breast meat over a pile of lettuce varnished with sweet-sour dressing. Push aside the mushy cherry tomatoes. This isn’t quite an ode to the aromatic skewers of Indonesia, but for mall food,it gets the job done. ',\n",
       "  'Regular fries: Underseasoned and undercooked ($6). They’re a fine advertisement for the $12 tallow fries, which are really your only option here. ',\n",
       "  'Tallow tenderloin: Tenderloin prepared correctly can be a wonderful thing. But at Belcampo, the butchers’ effort to age the cut in tallow is in vain: The filet ($56) channels its reputation as the bland chicken breast of the bovine world. The overcooked interior is barely salvaged by a sticky veal reduction sauce. ',\n",
       "  'Charcoal-rubbed ribeye: Imagine the flavor of a regular ribeye, but deprived of silky fats or deep flavor ($80). My meals here were possibly the first time I’ve ever experienced a steak that’s simultaneously medium rare and dessicated. The level of salt is so high that the steak tastes cured. The exterior cap, often the most flavorful and succulent part of the steak, has been  overcooked to the point of Dracarys-style carbonization. ',\n",
       "  'Double Fast: This is the restaurant’s classic double burger ($12). The kitchen manages to incinerate the meat in such a way that it’s entirely gray and overcooked within. On one visit, the exterior was bereft of a salty char, while on another, there was excellent char, but still no salt or beefiness. The dominant flavor profile is mustard.',\n",
       "  'Dry-aged burgers: The 28-day patty is a thoroughly average entry into the crowded restaurant-burger field ($16). The underseasoned meat isn’t quite dry, but it isn’t juicy either. A mound of caramelized onions and white cheddar provide the bulk of the flavor, while the meat itself it little different from any generic diner burger. The 100-day burger ($28) boasts almost zero dry-aged flavor. It’s just a pile of tender meat on a bun, undercooked to the point of mimicking the texture of pate. If you’re going to spend this much on a burger, go to Minetta Tavern. ',\n",
       "  'Cost: Most starters, bowls, and soups at $18 or less. Burgers at $12 (double patty), $16 (dry-aged beef or lamb), $28 (extra-aged). Steaks start at $28 and go way up from there.',\n",

Small mountains of ice hold a seafaring selection not often seen in New York: emperor fish, with anime eyes and a millenial-pink sheen. Carabinero shrimp, as unnaturally red as a Coca-Cola can. Rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest Jurassic Park film. This is where you choose your dinner — a process that occurs, almost universally, after you’ve plowed through half a pomegranate daiquiri. It’s the maritime equivalent of shopping for engagement rings with a glass of bubbly. ',\n",
       "  'You almost don’t notice when a waiter recommends you kick off the meal with langoustines that runs $102 per pound. Besides, there’s no way he’ll give you anything close to a pound. Right?',\n",

       "  'One of the holy grails of modern fine dining has been finding a way to de-emphasize the transactional experience of a meal. The culinary arts have always been uniquely handicapped in this sense. Opera would have a different feel if a soprano kicked off the evening by telling spectators “this aria is going to cost you a ton,” and then sent out a check to everyone at the end of the night.',\n",

       "  'The saga starts back at that tour. The captains sing nuanced praises for the barbounia, fagi, and lavraki. They know which ones are oily, which ones are buttery, and that there’s “not much cheek meat in the turbot.” They know every detail — except for the prices, a subject they avoid so diligently that one wonders whether these veritable ichthyologists skipped a very specific day of school.',\n",
       "  'By-the-pound prices are posted above most fish. That price, though, means you’re looking not at the actual cost but the raw data for an incomplete math equation. Either way, you’re paying more attention to the waiter’s musings on the Milos yacht (which you can apparently rent in the Aegean Sea), or how a two-and-a-half-pound lobster would be nice for a solo diner. The lobsters bear no price tags, which is dangerous for a main that costs more than round-trip airfare to Chicago.',\n",
       "  'You return to your linen-clad table and ask for two langoustines and a turbot. The server says the whole fish is three pounds. You know the price is $56 per pound — you were smart enough to take notes — so you figure you’ll be out $160. And yet, when the bill comes, the price is $197. That can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil. Then you take a closer look at the check and notice the fish is half a pound heavier than the waiter told you it would be. Whoops!',\n",
       "  'Those langoustines, in turn, boast a sweet, gas-grilled aroma, though they lack the intense, oceanic aroma these crustaceans have elsewhere. You didn’t inquire about the price, because you got tired of asking “How much do these actually cost?” You figured a few prawns would cost less than caviar service. You figured wrong. They’re a cool $87 for an appetizer’s worth of meat. This is when you start to spew expletives. ',\n",
       "  'The well-heeled might find this system unobtrusive, and perhaps there’s something honest about assigning a very specific price to an individual fish based on its weight. There’s also a certain elegance in convincing guests to part with a few extra dollars and make them feel like it was worth it. ',\n",
       "  'But everyday gourmands might find something disingenuous about implementing that system in such a way that dinner ends up costing you $100 more than you budgeted for. Constant incongruities on a bill at Milos feel more like the work of an unscrupulous bookie than an honest act of hospitality. ',\n",
       "  'The food, too, does not always deliver on unexpectedly ballooned costs. The carabinero prawns — a receptionist told me I’d pay $30 apiece; the bill charged $40 — tasted like shellfish to the power of 10, but a lobster pasta in which diced tail meat gets tossed into a sherry cream sauce did little better than neighborhood restaurants that charge almost four times less. With two medium-sized claws, the middling dish arrived on the bill at $189. ',\n",
       "  'Instead, order the soft-shell crab. At $27 apiece, they’re a heck of a price, but the cooks do them right, pan-frying them in a way that seems to preserve their briny juices better than elsewhere. The best way to hit Milos, though, is to sit at the bar, order a pound of the rarely-seen-in-NYC fried red mullets, and tear away at the small fish with a buddy. The impossibly sweet flesh, when it’s not overcooked, recalls the fragrant, mineral aromas of the Mediterranean.',\n",

If nothing else, his New York stalwart deserves credit for occupying a very specific role in the fine dining community; the city’s most expensive restaurants have long focused on manipulating, refining, and saucing food, while Milos has always been the ultimate pure product emporium, minimally adorning fish and serving them grilled, pan-fried, or salt-baked.

       "  'At a proper fine dining establishment, the kitchen never sends out a fat slice of wagyu or butter-poached lobster as a first course, nor does a tasting of yakitori or Korean barbecue typically begin with the namesake items.

That’s followed by maccheroni con pomodoro, wherein a bit of Parmesan imparts a zippy tomato sauce with a round, MSG-like savoriness. The feast crescendos with a fistful of ethereal tagliolini al ragu — more on that in a bit — and then finishes with anolini, little ham-stuffed ravioli covered in Parmesan fondue. A server drizzles 25-year balsamic all over them, a dark, agrodolce counterpart to the stark white sauce. It’s not quite dessert, but it’s enough of a cheese course to serve as the meal’s logical coda.',\n",

That is to say: Each course is just a few bites, with subtle variations in richness, umami, and acidity expressing themselves within the confines of a form that might otherwise seem repetitive to a casual observer. Chef Stefano Secchi’s ability to make this feel like a complete meal, with all its fluctuations, suggests he’s only beginning to show off his true potential.',\n",
       "  'Rezdôra, which also offers a la carte selections under $30, marks a vital moment in the state of New York Italian dining. It represents a rare high-profile Big Apple restaurant led by a noted alum from Osteria Francescana. That three-Michelin-starred temple in Modena, led by the charismatic Massimo Bottura, is famous for its avant-garde approach to the foods of Emilia-Romagna. Think: a lemon tart that recalls a Jackson Pollock painting, or a dish called “Eel swimming up the Poe river,” which Bottura claims is “both recipe and fable.”',\n",
       "  'Alas, the only real resemblance Rezdôra bears to Francescana are the whimsical names of certain dishes. There’s “Cow grazing in Emilia” for a simple course of Creekstone beef. The cut sports a straightforward bovine punch and a neat little herb salad. “Grandma walking through forest,” in turn, is the long-winded moniker for green cappelletti. The noodles, which look like the cute conical hats that Robin Hood wore in the 1973 Disney cartoon, are topped with verdant spring peas, stuffed with sweet ricotta, and placed atop an earthy mash of black fungi. This is your salad course.',\n",
       "  'If Francescana is all about modernism, Rezdôra leans more smartly classical. This jibes with New York’s larger gastronomic pulse, which tends to favor technique, regionalism, culinary straightforwardness, and sleepy steakhouses over chemistry-like wizardry. But neither that reality nor the generic design of the dining room — plank floors, exposed brick, cramped two-tops, a white marble bar — detracts from the precise rustic cooking that occurs here every night.',\n",
       "  'When one thinks of Emilia-Romagna, a Northern Italian region that lies between the Po River and the Apennine Mountains, staples like Parmesan, prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, truffles, and ragu bolognese come to mind.

Golden orbs of pita-like puffed bread sit below piles of salumi, their nuttiness heightened by the warmth of the boulangerie. Emilia-Romagna is also known for its insanely plump Vignola cherries, which Stecchi pairs with a sufficiently milky (and tiny) pile of stracciatella.',\n",
       "  'One could go on about those dishes, or the softly braised rabbit, matched with glazed veal sweetbreads. Really, though, the primary purpose of a trip to Rezdôra is pasta. About four portions make a light meal for two. Order any of them, from the spaghetti vongole, slicked in a clam sauce as concentrated as a quart of boiled ocean water, to the infrequently seen doppio tortelli. The latter holds salty prosciutto and oozy Parmesan foam in two separate “tubes.” Eating one, slicked in truffle butter, is like chomping on an Italian riff on a soup dumpling; when bit, it squirts out warm sauce with abandon.',\n",
       "  'Now let’s talk about that ragu. ',\n",
       "  'Though often considered a straightforward dish, ragu famously became an exercise in the avant-garde with Bottura, who once asked “Could a plate of tagliatelle [al ragu] be at the vanguard in the same way as an abstraction of Parmigiano-Reggiano?” His restaurant elevated the staple by cooking the meats — which include beef cheek and veal tail — sous-vide for 24 hours, and it became one of his best-known dishes. Anyone who’s fallen in love with the cooking of Bottura will want to know how Rezdôra compares.',\n",
       "  'Secchi’s recipe is different. He simmers a blend of soffrito, pork shoulder, mortadella, ground pork, and salumi for eight hours with Parmesan sachets. When a patron orders the tagliolini, the kitchen emulsifies it in just a hint of tomato sauce and extra-virgin olive oil. ',\n",
       "  'The cooking is finished in the sauce itself. The same could be said of any pasta, but what makes that technique so powerful here is the thinness of the tagliolini. Al dente isn’t the point. These are softer and stretchier, closer to the texture of rice vermicelli. They’re designed to absorb that wonderful ragu. ',\n",
       "  'Some nights the sauce is thicker and pinker; other evenings, the slurry is looser. But on each visit, the ragu — smooth and devoid of coarse chunks — exhibits nuclear-level meatiness. One doesn’t necessarily taste the flavors of the component salumi; the experience rather conveys an otherworldly level of carnivorous umami. It will make your gums tingle. However rustic its sheen, the dish is as worthy of worship as any of the painterly creations coming out of the kitchen at Atomix.',\n",
       "  'The same, alas, cannot be said of the sweets. Gelati, from pistachio to stracciatella, sport a thin, almost icy texture and forgettable, saccharine flavors. In a city with so many good ice cream purveyors, Secchi should just ditch his product, which wouldn’t pass muster at a 7-Eleven. Generically soft olive oil cake, about on par with something from Entenmann’s, gets the job done with mediocrity, as does a passable tiramisu. ',\n",

       "  'My second piece of advice about the banya, a Slavic sweat-bathing tradition for over 1,000 years, is that you will eat well there. This is particularly true at Spa 88 in FiDi, a two decade-old sanitarium where people in bathing suits feast on some of the city’s finest former Soviet  Union fare. I’ve been schvitzing here for the better part of a decade, a love affair that began because another one ended. Briefly: She moved out of my place and into his. And the banya is where I went to recover. It was a place to numb my pain without alcohol, to take an impromptu nap without explanation (try that in a bar), and to have an emotional meltdown without interrupting dinner. ',\n",

The poor chap doesn’t realize his predicament until he wakes up 450 miles away from home, in the bed of a woman no less.

Chains like Empire Szechuan concentrated there, and one of our earliest Sichuan chefs, Wei Kai Chang, established himself at a restaurant simply called Szechuan. So it’s not too much of a stretch that this neighborhood flourishes again as a bastion of regional Chinese cooking. Part of the reason is the proximity of Columbia University, where Asia-born students and faculty crave restaurants that provide a better taste of back home.',\n",

And Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Chinese-American food also appears. But Li does not always stick to tradition here, often innovating on classics of the genre.',\n",

The mural is a continuation of his video animation series “New Classics of Mountains and Seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by. The art creates a calmness in the restaurant, which mounts a menu that flies to the four corners of China for its inspiration. ',\n",

It arrives in a wash of tart yellowish broth made of preserved green pepper, with, on the occasion I tried it, a chicken talon sticking out of the broth and pointing accusatorially. The chicken parts are accompanied by various vegetables. What a lovely sight! Other don’t-miss Hunan dishes include beef jerky, dry as driftwood yet spectacular in its addictive properties, and spicy dried tofu ($10.95), a pepper-flecked barrage of compressed tofu triangles that achieve the texture of Twizzlers, served room temp.',\n",

The small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus.

One of the most intriguing regional dishes comes from Dongbei in the far northeast, where sweet and sour was supposedly invented.

The crustacean thrives on wave-battered rocks and cliffs. Those who collect them, on the Iberian or Pacific Coasts, are equal parts fishers, foragers, and climbers. Their toolsets include wetsuits, harnesses, clamps, and when necessary, ropes for rappelling. To harvest a barnacle means to risk death. But to consume one, a possibility at the spectacular Saint Julivert Fisherie in Brooklyn, means to sample one of the world’s great delicacies. ',\n",

The stubby, ugly creatures serve as a stark visual contrast to the crab-stuffed avocados and other attractive small plates in which Saint Julivert specializes. The calcified head of a gooseneck evokes a malformed clam, while the brown thorax recalls a petrified lizard phallus. They are boiled in salt water and served as is. No sauce, no lemon. A waiter advises twisting off the leathery body, revealing a single longitudinal muscle. Sometimes that muscle is pink. Sometimes it’s tan or black. In neither case does it appear edible or delicious. ',\n",

Or it might, depending on the barnacle, convey its sugars in a more restrained fashion, like those of a Maine lobster. Still others recall the briny wallop of a crashing wave pulling you under. Each bite is unique. What is inevitable, however, is that three minutes into eating, your hands will turn sticky with shellfish juice. ',\n",

But if a dozen oysters can run $50 elsewhere, or if a tin of caviar can command $100 anywhere in the city, it’s hard not to think of this rare barnacle for what it truly is: a value.

Securing experienced restaurant staff is difficult everywhere in the Bay Area these days, but hiring in Berkeley is especially tricky, due to its seasonality as a university town, less big-city bustle, and, maybe most importantly, because the minimum wage is almost two bucks higher across the Bay Bridge.

After sawing without success, I requested something sharper.

Lukewarm, wallowing in a muddy puddle of black tahini hummus, it’s scattered with almonds and golden raisins and an earthy green chermoula. The dish made me wish they’d just charred the cauliflower — as restaurants are wont to do these days — and let it be. ',\n",

       "  '“Even Jennifer Lawrence had to wait for a table at Brooklyn hotspot Lilia,” a New York Post headline read this spring. One can relate. A new rite of passage for New York gourmands is approaching the host at the Williamsburg destination and getting quoted a wait time that seems mathematically impossible. Those who arrive just before 5 p.m. will encounter a line that stretches down the block. And those who check for online reservations will think they’ve happened upon the ticketing website for Elton John’s goodbye tour — nothing available. ',\n",
       "  'The reason for such insanity is the cooking of Missy Robbins, a singular commodity in a city where Italian food is nothing less than ubiquitous. No one else seems to lace their garlic bread with speckles of orange bottarga, or dust their mafaldini with coarse grinds of pink peppercorns. When Pete Wells came to review Lilia in 2016, he awarded three stars and issued a specific bit of praise: ”Pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness,” the NYT critic wrote. Demand quickly outstripped supply. ',\n",
       "  'A sequel was all but inevitable. And so in September Robbins opened a second spot, Misi, in the heart of the $3 billion Domino Sugar redevelopment. Here the focus would be more streamlined. While the menu at Lilia spans multiple categories, Misi’s only starters are vegetables. The only desserts are gelati. And the only mains — beefy specials notwithstanding — are pastas, all made in a 325-square-foot, temperature- and humidity-controlled room. ',\n",
       "  'Feel like swinging by? As I write this, the next available reservation is at 11:00 p.m. On a Monday. One month from today. For counter seating. Walk-ins who show up late might sit down immediately, while those who swing by at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday can wait 90 minutes or longer for bar seats. It’s all enough to make one assume that Robbins has again given New York one of its best new Italian restaurants. If only that were the case.',\n",
       "  'Misi, at the very least, is a scene. Here’s Bobby Flay on a date. There’s Action Bronson, sporting his signature beard. Golden helium balloons float about in the private room next door. Four hosts greet patrons behind a low-rise table; it recalls the check-in counter at a chic charity event. The open kitchen shines just brightly enough to flatter patrons at the chef’s counter. The bartenders pour frothy bellinis that diners suck down in seconds. The servers whisk over uneven pastas. The prime window seats overlook the Williamsburg Bridge in all its nocturnal... wait, there’s an issue with the pastas?',\n",
       "  'There is. The noodles range from serviceable — like a forgettable pappardelle with chickpeas — to nearly disastrous — an oppressively saline bowl of fish sauce-laced linguine. In fact, the pasta problems are distinct enough that they can stop a bona fide Robbins aficionado mid-sentence. ',\n",
       "  'A few weeks ago my companion was monologuing about the genius of the chef and her roasted romanesco. Robbins showers the toothsome florets with an electric blend of lemon juice, olive oil, and coriander, imparting the stubby brassica with a vibrancy that’s at once electric, luscious, and fragrant. Then I watched my friend turn silent as he tried the carpaccio-like corzetti. Handsome rounds of pasta sat underneath an insipid tomato sauce and a canopy of fresh basil; the herb obliterated whatever nuance there might’ve been in the first place.',\n",
       "  'Clockwise left: Spinach ricotta tortelli, chef Missy Robbins, the bar and dining room at Misi',\n",
       "  'This is not the Missy Robbins we know, the mind behind one of the pastas of the decade: Lilia’s agnolotti with sheep’s milk ricotta. She uses saffron-infused honey — a bit of sugar and perfume — to counteract the tartness and funk of the cheese. The interplay of flavors is almost scientific in its balance, and yet the pairing is as simple as a composed cheese plate. ',\n",
       "  'Or consider her rigatoni al diavola, also at Lilia. Spicy tomato sauce is a common enough preparation, but it somehow tastes cleaner and more alive under Robbins’s control. The San Marzanos are brighter and more acidic than elsewhere, while the Calabrian chiles exude a warming spiciness. ',\n",
       "  'It’s from these two dishes that one derives a certain Tao of Robbins. The chef tweaks classic preparations in such a way that they taste fresh and revelatory. And she concocts gently creative pastas that somehow feel intuitive and seamless within the multitudinous traditions of Italian cooking. She’s neither an avowed regionalist, like the devoutly Tuscan Rita Sodi, nor a more freeform experimentalist, like the chefs at Don Angie. At her best, Robbins is a pasta pragmatist, drawing on countless styles and influences to make absolutely inimitable noodles. ',\n",
       "  'At Misi, by contrast, the only consistently impressive thing about the pastas is their al dente firmness.',\n",
       "  'Robbins can do better. She concocts a briny (if thin) clam broth and pairs it with a pile of gently mealy malloreddus, a small Sardinian gnocchi. The golden liquid doesn’t permeate the bland pasta, nor does the dish bring any of its promised saffron aroma. Rigatoni, boasting a tomato sauce with 30 cloves of garlic, assaults the palate with salt and cheese. Strangozzi, long, thick noodles, get tossed with a one-note pork ragu; the dish begs for a rounder flavor (and maybe just a touch of acid). And linguine with anchovy and colatura — an Italian fish sauce — packs a level of salt that gives the brain a very distinct message: Stop eating. Which we did.',\n",
       "  'And then there were the white truffles. The seasonal fungi, at their best, exhibit a pungent fragrance that lingers in the air on the palate for minutes. Here, they’re shaved over an otherwise fine fettuccine with Parmesan and buffalo butter. But the aroma is short and flat, like that of a Designer Imposter cologne instead of the real thing. At $91, it could put a novice off this luxury forever.',\n",
       "  'The only pasta that shows any real sign of classic Robbins brilliance are the occhi, little ravioli that the cooks stuff with sheep’s milk ricotta and drench in butter, bottarga, and lemon zest. Not a single element falls out of balance; the warm dairy heats up the roe, releasing its perfume, while the aromatic citrus and puckery cheese keep the maritime tang in check. ',\n",
       "  'The smart strategy at Misi is to order the occhi and stock up on another forte of Robbins: vegetables. Cooks roast eggplants until they exhibit the texture of pudding and drizzle the insides with crimson Calabrian chile oil. You scoop out the smoky, spicy, fleshy insides with a spoon and eat this happy dish like a child devouring ice cream. The kitchen takes grilled bread the thickness of Texas Toast and pipes whipped ricotta on top. The cheese shimmers like marshmallow fluff. Diners finish plating the crostini themselves, placing blistered and vinegared peppers on top. The result is pure cream, char, and crunch. ',\n",
       "  'If a porterhouse for two is offered, order it ($110). The meat veers away from the prevailing New York style of steak, an ode to aging and blue cheese funk. Robbins instead opts for a more cheffed-up preparation, crusting the exterior in fennel pollen, charring it rare, and drizzling enough lemon juice over the cut to qualify it as a modern, high-acid dish. The flavors are simple and pure: concentrated beefiness followed by the mellow sweetness of singed anise.',\n",
       "  'Steak, of course, calls for ice cream. Mint gelato manages to exhibit the assertive grassiness of the herb without any of the menthol-like sting. Toasted almond, as tan as khakis, pushes the envelope on what a frozen dessert is; it mirrors the texture and richness of finely ground nut butter. And fior di latte does what that flavor does best: expresses the taste of fresh milk as cleanly as mozzarella.',\n",
       "  'In this shiny slice of Williamsburg, the gelati are a fine way to end what’s, unexpectedly, a perfect steakhouse meal of sides, martinis, wine, and, if it’s available, that porterhouse. But as a pasta spot that people wait a month to get into for an 11 p.m. reservation, it needs work. Robbins, who helped make regulars out of the Obamas during her days at Spiaggia in Chicago, is unquestionably one of the country’s great Italian chefs. But for now, Misi is just another exclusive restaurant in another exorbitant neighborhood.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Vegetable starters under $20; pastas under $30; steak for two at $110 (as a special). Gelati are $8 apiece. Expect to spend about $100 per person or more.',\n",
       "  'Sample dishes: Ricotta toast with marinated peppers; eggplant with Calabrian chile oil; roasted romanesco; fettuccine with Parmesan and buffalo butter; occhi with bottarga and lemon zest; rigatoni with 30-clove ragu; malloreddus with clams, sea beans, and saffron; porterhouse for two, assorted gelati.',\n",
       "  'Bonus tip: Sometimes walk-ins are accommodated immediately. Sometimes the wait can stretch past 90 minutes. And sometimes the hosts stop taking names by 8:30 p.m. No one picks up the phone to chat about wait times; an answering machine advises to email for immediate assistance.

But Pheasant has found another way. Tentacles are braised for up to two hours and pan-roasted in olive oil, then deposited in a slurry of spicy liquid salami and the concentrated yogurt called labneh, providing a funky and sour contrast to the blandness of the creature, which develops a texture like red licorice laces.

The restaurant is descended from a catering company called Little Pheasant, run by Cat Alexander along with her husband and chef Vincent Fraissange, who was formerly executive chef at Taavo Somer’s experimental Williamsburg restaurant Isa.',\n",
       "  'Pheasant’s 16-item menu is one of those that doesn’t really distinguish between apps and mains, and some of the former can function as light meals, especially if you’re not too hungry. The bill of fare incorporates diverse and sometimes wild Mediterranean elements into such bistro commonplaces as hanger steak, seasonal vegetables, roast chicken, a twisted burger, quirky salads, and “day boat” halibut.',\n",
       "  'Take a favorite seasonal vegetable — thick-stalked asparagus — perfect in its freshness and snap. You almost wouldn’t recognize it at Pheasant. The rods have been lightly battered like tempura, flash fried so no limpness results, then scattered on the plate with puffy buttons of potato mousse and cooling slices of ham. Ham? Yes, and not prosciutto, either, but good old American smoked ham like your mom or dad might have put in your sandwich if you grew up in the Midwest. The dish ($11) is summery dining perfection, and might be the best thing on the menu.',\n",
       "  'Is that menu overly creative? Not for me. I enjoyed the Fez salad; it douses greens and vegetables with a carrot-cumin vinaigrette. I also loved a red endive salad that added pecans and goat cheese to the crunchy lettuce, and swamped them in a sherry vinaigrette that was thicker and more opaque than its name suggests. It’s a dish that disappeared from the menu last week but will be back next year, when the seasons change again. ',\n",
       "  'That dish really just shows that you can’t go wrong picking vegetables as your meal at Pheasant. This is especially true with the single vegetarian entrée ($18) — itself an inviolable trope of neighborhood bistro menus. Here, it is based on boxcars of polenta that have been deep fried, resulting in audible crunch and a supremely corny flavor. You’ll be teasing them out from their forest of ‘shrooms as you sop up the ramp chimichurri with the focaccia ($6) you should have ordered at the commencement of the meal.',\n",
       "  'As if to balance out the vegetarian entrée, a juicy hamburger is also available, but not just any hamburger. It comes with slices of kielbasa on top, maybe to remind you what lurks on the other side of the BQE.  (Answer: Polish Greenpoint). And the burger isn’t the messiest thing on the menu: One upping Buffalo, a plate of chicken wings comes so drenched in scarlet sauce that it will leave fingers, face, and shirtfront comically smeary. Moist wipes are provided.',\n",
       "  'As with many bistros of this sort, the larger dishes can seem a bit flat compared with the smaller ones. A nicely-browned half chicken comes on a bed of yellow rice with a dipping sauce and side salad. While perfectly satisfying and plenty of food at the price ($21), it doesn’t really light a fire under your tastebuds. Similarly, a large plate of hanger steak cuts plenty of medium rare meat into big cubes, but leaves you wishing the steak had been left intact without the distraction of roasted turnips.',\n",

Dubbed sisig, it started out as a tart papaya salad in the 18th century (“sisigan” means “to make it tart” in Tagalog), but by the 20th century, it was being fabricated with finely minced pig-head and liver. According to one story, this version was invented by local Filipinos using pig parts discarded by cooks at an American Air Force base in Angeles City.',\n",
       "  'True story or not, sisig exploded in popularity after World War II, when the larders of the country expanded, and cooks began using other main ingredients. When the dish came to be served in a hot cast-iron skillet as a favorite street food, an alliterative modifier was added and “sizzling sisig” was born. Its popularity here in America only increased when Anthony Bourdain lauded it as a drinking snack: “I think sisig is perfectly positioned to win the hearts and minds of the world as a whole…exactly what you need after a few beers.”',\n",

The squid sisig outdoes it in the crunch department, though chopped so fine it’s difficult to make out individual pieces of mollusk. The tofu sisig boasts a nicely browned dice of firm bean curd, lots of purple onions, and a white gravy that tastes like coconut milk and mayo, though there’s no actual coconut in it.

The prevailing resurgence of French food in Manhattan has taken a variety of forms, from hip small plates spots with natural wines to haute-poultry purveyors to exalted tasting palaces. What distinguishes La Mercerie — and what ranks it as one of the most compelling Gallic spots of the past decade — is its unusual dedication to riffing on humble French-cafe fare.',\n",
       "  'A waiter ferries over a white plate covered by a craggy grey dome. This is the grilled buckwheat crepe; it hides a soft pile of chicken cut with carrots (for sweetness), cream (for richness), and tarragon (for aroma).

It’s not so much a standard portable crepe as something that could hold its own at a Michelin-starred establishment. ',\n",

Rose asks $15 for this masterpiece. ',\n",

But best of all is when the kitchen sends out icy Kushi oysters with pats of seaweed butter.

In the afternoon, you come for a rare filet, doused in cognac sauce, and paired with tangy blue cheese pommes dauphine. And on a sweaty summer evening, you come for the salad nicoise, with a pile of slow-cooked tuna, green beans, and olives drenched in enough pungent anchovy vinaigrette to make the palate beg for Champagne.',\n",

There’s nothing uncommon about mixing restaurants and retail; Bloomingdales, ABC Home, and other department stores have a long history of hosting culinary establishments. The reason for these mashups are as simple as a buffet in a Vegas casino: to keep people inside and to keep them spending. ',\n",
       "  'But at La Mercerie, where the cost of goods is so completely out of reach to so many, the restaurant rather takes on the air of an aspirational advertisement, a postcard from a fictional millionaire’s lifestyle.

That bit of fiction is one of the first things that came to mind while dining at Manhatta, Danny Meyer’s new French spot in the Financial District; the 60th floor digs afford such intimate views of neighboring towers that the effect is like a comic. Everything is larger than life.',\n",

Manhatta’s dim lighting and neutral browns (think: wood-paneled floors, walnut-hued tables, and leather sofas) speak to a simple design ethos: Don’t distract from the view. Giant windows provide an IMAX-style panorama, framing the quartz-like asymmetries of Hudson Yards, the polychrome of the Empire State, and the Jenga-like stacking of 56 Leonard — just a hang-glider ride away in Tribeca.',\n",

The building’s lithe spire looms so large it’s like dining near a Depression-era fantasy of a spaceship. And if that’s still not vivid enough, kindly put down your Champagne and pick up that pair of binoculars on the windowsill. You can see families watching Monday night football in the chic Frank Gehry building across the way.',\n",

In the smattering of Manhattan bars and restaurants with serious views, admission comes with an elevation upcharge; one thinks of the $25 cocktails at the Aviary, or the upper floors at One World Trade, where the entrance fees can top out at $130 for two — before food. Meyer, by contrast, keeps things a bit more reasonable; he asks $78, service included, for three courses. Gourmands could easily spend more on a ground-level meal in Midtown. ',\n",

A crimson puck of tarragon-laced tuna tartare, next to a few pretty lettuce leaves, serves as an inoffensive protein delivery mechanism, dissolving on the tongue without much heat or acidity. It is simply food. Cavatelli, in turn, is virtually indistinguishable from other generic pasta dishes around the city; it’s a ho-hum melange of tomato, sauce, and pecorino. It is plain nourishment.

You work your way through a roasted halibut over beans — a touch overcooked, but not dreadfully so — or pan-seared sweetbreads in a creamy blanquette sauce, the organ meats as silky and soft as fresh mozzarella. And then you continue on with your ogling of the cityscape. ',\n",
       "  'In one regard, such a setup is thoughtful; no one wants anything requiring a tableside “here’s how to eat this” speech while soaking up a once-in-a-lifetime vista. But in another sense, there’s something decidedly stodgy about the implicit premise of Manhatta, which is that diners up high almost exclusively want another safe breed of continental-American fare, another serving of flaky turbot with brown butter and capers. It’s an assumption that has governed the “dinner with a view” class for venues for decades, from the old Windows on the World to the Rainbow Room to the current offerings at One World Trade. And barring a people’s revolution, it’s an assumption that will likely inform the upcoming rooftop offerings at 70 Pine and 15 Hudson Yards.',\n",

He delivers a very good duck a l’orange, expertly rendering out the fats in the gently gamy breast. And he has a near work of art with his foie gras, a geometrically precise terrine over a layer of barely chewy tete de veau. It is a sweet-salty candy bar like few others. ',\n",
       "  'The meal winds down with desserts, perhaps a competent vanilla souffle or a requisitely sticky date cake. If this were an a la carte menu, you’d probably skip these sweets, but it’s not worth complaining much here; the prix fixe means spending a bit more time overlooking nocturnal Manhattan in its luminescent glory. And while the city doesn’t suffer from any shortage of good Gallic food, Meyer’s ability to make this space unusually accessible is a true gift to New York.',\n",

I daydreamed about the gorgeous char before it arrived — and when it did, on a scorching cast-iron pan, the bulgogi turned out to be perfectly seared, crunchy, and packed with notes of sugar, sesame, and soy.

The best way to eat the staple dish, called yangnyeom gejang, is however the heck you can, but this critic advises slurping the grey, slippery meat out of the shell and enjoying the gentle brininess before the full heat assault takes over (tamer types can scoop out the meat with a spoon).

The bird lacks any of the garlic or chile sauces so frequently associated with Korean-style fries. It’s just plain fried chicken that’s sufficiently juicy, crispy, and brined, with a touch of sweetness, and a wallop of concentrated poultry flavor.

       "  'When Andrea Clurfeld of the Asbury Park Press reviewed a small Jersey Shore restaurant in 1997, she used the type of exuberant yet technical language one might associate with a French fine dining palace. Except this was a humble pie joint — Una Pizza Napoletana. The baker was Anthony Mangieri. The ingredients were imported from Italy. And the recipe for the naturally leavened dough was “handed down by the gods,” Clurfeld wrote.',\n",
       "  'Mangieri, alas, would shutter his first pizzeria. He relocated to the East Village in 2004, at a time when the city’s top pizzerias were Brooklyn stalwarts known less for showcasing top-tier products and more for following their own traditions. But the crowds came to Una, paying $17 for the margherita. In 2009 Times critic Frank Bruni called the cherry tomato pizza the city’s best — less than two weeks before Una 2.0 unexpectedly served its final pies. Mangieri was moving Una again, this time to San Francisco. His priest performed mass at the restaurant on opening night. He initially charged $20 for his creations, eventually upping the price to $25. When he closed it last year to move back to New York, local food writers penned eulogies whose tones suggested the premature death of a beloved humanitarian.',\n",
       "  'It’s hard to think of any extant pizzaiolo, other than Chris Bianco, who has been the subject of such critical praise over the past two decades. And it’s almost impossible to think of a single other American chef who, instead of building a small empire, has chosen to live the life of a solo craftsman, closing his successful restaurants whenever he moves. This is what brings us to the Lower East Side, where Mangieri has partnered with chefs and restaurateurs Fabian von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone to open Una 4.0. It’s with a nod toward statistical probability, rather than cynicism, that one supposes it might not last forever. ',\n",
       "  'And it’s with a nod toward reality that one realizes his pies aren’t as good as they should be, not at $25 apiece, and not in the crowded, experimental, ingredient-obsessed, regionally focused pizza biosphere that is contemporary New York.',\n",
       "  'Una’s new digs suggest a futuristic diner crossed with a place of worship. There are stark white walls, black floor tiles, bare brown tabletops, emerald green chairs that fall over easily if you lean back, gray screens arranged in Mondrian-like patterns, and a pizza oven spitting fire from behind a glass partition. How sepulchral. Mangieri stands behind that partition, making pies. Patrons watch as he molds the dough, applies the toppings, and pours olive oil from a copper cruet. He uses a metal peel to methodically rotate the pies in his oven, momentarily lifting them (to even out the cooking) before extricating them from the flames. ',\n",
       "  'His movements are efficient, elegant, hypnotic. And his bread is without equal among the city’s Neapolitan spots. The pie’s outer rim is as fluffy as a fresh doughnut, releasing steam when torn. The crust is only gently blistered, with a subtle sourdough tang. It’s the stuff Mangieri puts on top of that pie — subpar imported mozzarella, too much parsley, uneven salt — that often make the main event a letdown, however. Such an oversight would’ve been a problem of critical proportions under any other variant of Una, where only the only items up for grabs were Mangieri’s four or five pies, plus beer or wine.',\n",
       "  'But Una 4.0 spreads its risk, boasting a slightly longer menu that bookends the baking with starters and sweets. If one were to rank things, the chief reasons to visit are, in this order: the ice cream, the tiramisu, the small plates, the natural wines, the three tomato pizza, the marinara pie, the cherry tomato pie, the air conditioning, and then the margherita, which you can quite frankly skip. This Lower East Side spot, in other words, generally functions better as a modern Von Hauske and Stone restaurant than a classically minded Mangieri joint. ',\n",
       "  'Ice cream is among the chief summertime draws of any tristate pizza parlor, and so it’s worth noting that Von Hauske’s are among the city’s most electric. For the plain vanilla variety, he laces the dessert with a sucker punch of sodium, leaving an aftertaste that recalls the salty milk at the bottom of a bowl of corn flakes. For pistachio, he uses a Turkish paste that balances the product’s deep nuttiness with its heady perfume. And for all his ice creams, he builds his bases without egg, spinning equal parts cream and milk from Five Acre farms, resulting in a dairy drop kick so concentrated it almost tastes malted. ',\n",
       "  'One wouldn’t be faulted for dropping by Una for just for dessert — any dessert. Von Hauske brings life to the tired staple that is panna cotta by decorating it like a birthday cake, garnishing the outer rim with a fragrant ring of strawberries that have been sliced, whipped, and juiced. He also serves a rum- and Cynar-laced tiramisu, dense with ladyfingers and mascarpone, in a chalice, giving this kingly and complex confection the regal serving device it deserves. ',\n",
       "  'Starters, compliments of Stone, are equally destination-worthy, even if they’re more in loose conversation with the concept of a pizzeria than a kowtow to the form. The chef cuts raw filet mignon into thick strips and showers them in olives, pistachios, and a carbonara’s worth of parmesan. He uses ceci not in a chickpea salad, but rather to surround a circle of yuzukosho-spiked raw lobster, a wickedly delicious tartare. To channel pepperoni, he spreads spicy ’nduja sausage on a plate, topping it off with rounds of watery turnip and peppery nasturtium leaves; the effect evokes an edible version of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract circles. ',\n",
       "  'Some will find such appetizer experimentalism to be incongruous with traditional pizzas. I’d counter that it’s a valiant study in how refinement and rusticity, artistry and craft, deserve to coexist. Why? Because when I’m swigging back a honeyed Tokaji or frothy lambrusco, the fact that these small plates seem to belong to a separate restaurant take a back seat to a more important reality: They’re delicious. ',\n",
       "  'If only Mangieri’s pizzas — particularly the toppings — were as reliably delicious as those at Razza, Roberta’s, Sullivan Street, and so many other spots that charge $7-$12 less. Una’s filetti pie, to be fair, is still impressive, with the gorgeously pulpy cherry tomatoes acting as foil to a pile of (not terribly milky) buffalo mozzarella. The margherita, somewhat creamy on certain nights, can suffer from curds as flavorless as Polly-O string cheese on other evenings; Mangieri occasionally uses cheese so low in moisture its tastes like saline rubber. ',\n",
       "  'His marinara pie is more smartly composed, with a layer of fragrant garlic and olive oil yielding to the gentle fragrance of San Marzanos. The fruit doesn’t boast the compelling acidity or assertive aroma found in comparable pies around town; this is a more restrained study in the tomatoes’ complexity. Sometimes this is maddening; you often need to close your eyes and concentrate to divine the nature of these tomatoes. And sometimes, for just a bite or two, it all comes together; the pulp mixes with a salt crystal, resulting in a concoction as aromatic as rose.',\n",
       "  'Then on another night the marinara is underseasoned. So you ask for salt. A waiter shakes his head. This decision, for a nanosecond, is understandable. One wouldn’t walk into an opera house and tell the soprano to sing louder — but there’s something to be said for using a hearing aid. For some, salt is that hearing aid for flavor. Even at the city’s most expensive sushi parlors, chefs often give diners a tiny ramekin of shoyu, just in case. It’s a nice act of humility, and a comparable gesture at Una would go a long way given that dinner for one (a starter, a pizza, a dessert, two drinks) can run nearly $100 after tax and tip. ',\n",
       "  'The right move is to swing by on Fridays for the new “Concetta” pizza. Mangieri blends house-made tomato paste, roasted tomatoes, crushed San Marzanos, and pecorino. It’s an epic ode to the classic New York-style tomato pie. The flavors and textures are alternatingly jammy, tart, sugary, pulpy, umami-rich, and floral — at least that’s the case if you pick off the forest canopy’s worth of parsley, an herb whose bitterness overwhelms the tomato’s subtleties.',\n",
       "  'Pizza-making is tough, manual labor. Diners who click on the “about” section of Una’s website will encounter an article about Mangieri discussing the mental stress of the job and the toll of inhaling flour and smoke. For these sacrifices we should all be paying more. But it would help Mangieri’s case for higher prices if he were making better pizza.',\n",

       "  'MeMe’s Diner in Prospect Heights was empty at 10 p.m. on a recent Thursday. I walked in, took a seat at the counter, and grinned as a waiter placed a saucer of cheeseballs in front of me. This was not an artisanal product but an industrial one — neon corn puffs enrobed in dehydrated cheddar. Their bright orange hue took on the air of bioluminescence against the Christmas-green bar stools. I ate the puffs in between sips of passion fruit-laced milk punch; when I finished them the waiter asked if I’d like more. This transaction occurred in less time than it typically takes to get $7 bread service at a more upscale establishment. The cheeseballs were free. ',\n",
       "  'There were three staffers in the restaurant that night: the waiter, co-owner Bill Clark, who worked the front of the house, and co-owner Libby Willis, who oversaw the kitchen alone. Willis sent out my coconut-crusted sweet potato atop a pool of salsa verde and mole poblano, the sugary starch acting as a counterpoint to the tart, nutty, fiery sauces. I paired the dish with the restaurant’s signature Manhattan, a cocktail that Clark’s grandmother reportedly drinks every day. It was a big Manhattan.',\n",
       "  'Amid the quiet room I wondered if I was inside a modern, boozy version of Edward Hopper’s Nighthawks, the 1942 painting that depicted a sparsely populated Greenwich Village diner as a beacon on a dark city street. Then other patrons started showing up, and I was no longer alone, though really, I never was. ',\n",
       "  'The fact that MeMe’s is a newly opened diner — not to mention a queer-owned business with a largely queer and diverse staff — makes it an outlier of sorts, even if the term “diner” is loosely applied. A diner, after all, is supposed to serve lunch and breakfast; MeMe’s does not. And a diner is supposed to be old, which doesn’t say much for the future of the form. A Crain’s article from 2015 suggests the number of these establishments have dropped by nearly 60 percent over the past 25 years. The reasons are similar to why other small-time operators have been closing: The cost of business is going up as rents and labor costs continue to rise.',\n",
       "  'This reality is even tougher for a diner. Patrons expect longer hours, lower check averages, a patty melt that never changes, and epically lengthy menus, all in a venue where they can sit and read the newspaper for an hour and get free refills. And therein lies the paradox. Everything that allows independent restaurants to adapt to the city’s brutal restaurant economy, from seasonal menu innovations, to performative sourcing (organic this, fair trade that) to never-ending price hikes, goes against the very nature of what a diner is supposed to be: a stable respite from our brutally mutating capitalist world. ',\n",
       "  'Channeling the ethos of a diner, in other words, comes with handcuffs that are both financial and nostalgic. Willis and Clark succeed by playing by some of the rules; there are the lowish prices, the giant dinner portions. And then they bend some of the others, as with their freewheeling approach to comfort fare, which ranges from deliciously dorm room-y (potato chip-crusted mac and cheese with hot sauce) to healthfully voguish (quinoa, millet, and amaranth porridge). ',\n",
       "  'The setting, incidentally, is a 31-seat room boasting a teal-and-brown bar, a letterboard cocktail menu, bucket stools, frosted cake under a glass cloche, and tan leather benches. MeMe’s isn’t so much a utilitarian cafeteria as it is a rosy-eyed reanimation of a midcentury lunch counter. I can’t think of another restaurant with a Shirley Temple on the beverage list.',\n",

The burger, smashed between two slices of griddled marble rye, packs a deep maillard char, and drips with American cheese and Russian dressing.

       "  'Affordability is key. One can enjoy a giant egg sandwich, stacked with cheese and greens, for just eight bucks. A more composed brunch or dinner, with a beer, tax, and tip, will run about $30.

       "  'Related: Brunch is excellent. On a Sunday afternoon the restaurant was filled with people wearing dresses, graphic T-shirts, babies, hijabs, designer trucker caps, and statement necklaces. There are no free cheeseballs at brunch. There are free bowls of dry cereal instead, a mix of Lucky Charms, Froot Loops, Trix, and Golden Grahams. The cereal contains no milk or kitschy refinement, though it’s hard not to overlook the fact that the bespoke selection appears to have been coordinated with the restaurant’s own faded color scheme. The wait staff is happy to bring seconds. ',\n",
       "  'Willis and Clark base their approach to American comfort fare on a mix of “international pantry staples” (chile oil, fish sauce), “farmer’s market greens,” and “bodega standards,” to use their words. The cereal clearly belongs in the bodega camp. So do the migas — soft-scrambled eggs with cilantro served in a bag of Fritos. As the chipotle cream and green salsa absorbs into the corn chips, they soften into a glorious, fork pierce-able mush. Pair this with a few slices of Maldon-flecked cinnamon toast.',\n",
       "  'Just as stunning — and photogenic — are the fried eggs, served sunny side up on a bed of wilted kale. Willis surrounds them with a tidy moat of chile oil, the shallow pool filled with pepitas, sunflower seed, and poppy seeds. The flavor is gentle at first, complexly nutty, crunchy, and smoldering. And then pepper-laced greens assault the palate with a stinging uppercut of heat. ',\n",
       "  'In the evenings, the right way to kick off a meal is with the fried giardiniera, a fritto misto improved by the acidic tang of pickled carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers. Griddled meatballs, in turn, are doused in an intoxicating char siu-style mix of cinnamon, garlic, and hoisin. You retrieve them out of a ceramic crock with wooden toothpicks.',\n",

The suburban mall-style Buffalo chicken salad is everything it claims to be, a bed of blue cheese-studded lettuce below a pile of crispy hot sauce-slicked fowl.

       "  'The East Village’s Sorbillo is the first overseas branch of a well-regarded Naples pizzeria, opened late last November on Bowery. It’s helmed by Gino Sorbillo, as famous for his campaign against organized crime as for his pizza. He has gladly donned the mantle of celebrity chef and sashayed into the East Village wearing it for a few days before departing and leaving his brother Toto in charge. After a brief tenure and a few photo opps, Toto left too.',\n",
       "  'Still, even after their departure, a reminder of Sorbillo’s Italian celebrity remains in the East Village space. The expansive, well-lit interior has graphic texts in Italian along the walls, including a stenciled slogan “La Pizza Fa Miracoli” (or “pizza makes miracles”). Near the rear of the room, portraits of a bespectacled Sorbillo stare down from the walls like Big Brother. As for the supposedly celebrity-level pizzas, sure, you can get a great pie at Sorbillo — but only if you stick to the cheaper ones. ',\n",
       "  'Flying from the wood-burning beehive oven at the end of the room, the pizzas are of the classic Naples variety. Large enough to satisfy one person, they sport an airy, bulbous crust speckled with spots of char, and a fine texture that results from the imported flour used. The lower-cost pies revel in this simplicity, using mainly canned San Marzano tomatoes, domestic and imported mozzarella, and a drizzle of flavorful olive oil. Consistent with the genre, these pies are limp and damp in the middle, so you may have to pick up a knife and fork to eat them. ',\n",
       "  'Pizzas like the antica margherita ($17) are spectacular in their nuanced blandness. (Better not to think about the price of a similar pie in Naples, which is often less than half.) The vecchia Roma ($18), also worth the money, boasts shavings of uncured guanciale (hog jowl) in addition to Rome’s signature cheese, pecorino, which gives the pie a salty savor. ',\n",
       "  'This is brilliant pizza formulation, on a menu that confers themes inspired by Italian regions on most of its 15 pies. My favorite of all, Nduja ($22) is associated with Calabria, the toe of Italy’s boot. Across its surface lie little splotches of liquid salami, with rings of purple onion strewn around like hula hoops. The calzone’s worth ordering too, a Neapolitan specialty that wraps the same dough around a filling of ricotta, mozzarella, and salami, propelled by black pepper, making a meal of incredible richness. ',\n",
       "  'But some of the more expensive pies are terrible. One evening, a friend and I tested pizzas topped with porcini mushrooms and black truffles (the Firenze and the Alba, respectively priced at $30 and $35). The mushrooms were sodden and slippery, and the truffles lumpy with no delicacy of flavor; both tasted canned. Heck, if you have a fresh truffle, it’s not a bad idea to put it on a cheese pizza, but you must shave it on at the last minute.',\n",
       "  'The three Sorbillo branches in Naples mainly offer pizzas with a handful of starters, but when the idea of a New York branch was being hatched, someone had the bright idea that the place should be a full-blown Italian restaurant, too. This was a big mistake, leading the pizzas to almost seem like an afterthought on a tediously long menu. Let’s visit the other sections one by one.',\n",
       "  'First, there are the pastas, which tend to taste like something thrown together from leftovers. Pasta e piselli ($19) features tubettini, like stunted rigatoni, tossed with peas and bacon, but deriving little smoky benefit from the bacon. And the peas taste exceedingly tired. Nobody told the recipe developer that Americans don’t much like small, stale peas in their pasta.',\n",

Why even put them on the menu; who expects pizzaioli to make good pasta, anyway?',\n",
       "  'Not surprisingly, the apps mainly fail as well, including an adamantine version of fried calamari bested by nearly every bar in town, and salads that are mainly a heap of dry arugula and a few tomatoes that arrive entirely undressed. Yes, good olive oil and a so-so bottle of balsamic appear on the side, but really this is just the beginning of an acceptable dressing.',\n",
       "  'Then there’s a starter that consists of an unadorned lump of mozzarella and a pile of flavorless mushrooms without as much as a shake of salt. Overpriced at $21, it was as if someone proclaimed, “Dig up some apps that won’t take us a bit of trouble to make and charge plenty for them.”',\n",
       "  'But among the meat and contorni sections are at least a couple of gems. In the latter category, the sautéed escarole accented with black olives and capers is the soul of southern Italian cooking, and the same vegetable served with grilled sausage is similarly delicious, though at $21 for a single split sausage, it doesn’t really reflect the generosity and abundance of the cuisine.',\n",

       "  'When rice was primarily a staple, “a stomach filler, a vehicle for other foods,” it was, and often still is, “simply cooked by steaming,” author Najmieh Batmanglij writes in her excellent A Taste of Persia. But as modern cultivation methods developed over the centuries “the grain itself became a luxury,” she states, stressing that this was the case in Iran, as in Asia. Her geographic comparison is an astute one. The most expensive rice is generally sushi rice; aficionados tend to comment on its vinegar and temperature levels as if they were praying to a first-growth Bordeaux. But during whatever little discussion there is about Iranian cuisine in New York, rice itself is rarely mentioned as the complex indulgence it can be. ',\n",
       "  'The process of making saffron rice can involve rinsing the grains up to five times, parboiling them, steaming them, and gently scorching the bottom layer to form a nutty, golden crust called tahdig.',\n",
       "  'It’s a recipe whose steps are as precise as those of a more heralded paella or risotto. And when made correctly, as it often is at Sofreh, a modern Persian spot in Prospect Heights, it is as worthy of anything that an omakase chef anoints with tuna belly as part of a $250 tasting. ',\n",
       "  'The rice is firm, almost al dente. Like a mound of good caviar, the grains roll around on the tongue separately, without clumping. The dish smells richly of butter. On the palate, the flavor starts as vaguely sweet, and is then followed by the unmistakable pungency of saffron. It is not difficult to find decent saffron rice at the city’s kebab-heavy Persian spots; it mostly comes free as a side dish. At the skewer-free Sofreh, by contrast, this masterful version justifiably carries a separate charge, steakhouse style. Even next to gently griddled patties of ground beef in a pomegranate sauce, the strikingly nuanced rice steals the show.',\n",
       "  'Sofreh is an ode to the multitudinous flavors of Iran, from fruit-studded meat plates to sour ash soups to its use of rose in everything. It is also very much a work in progress. Food shows up before drink orders are taken. Drink orders take ages to arrive. Crumbs and errant splotches of mint-oil-infused eggplant puree (pretty delicious stuff) can sit on the table for uncomfortably long periods of time before things are wiped clean. Tahdig, sold separately from the saffron rice (as is the norm), exhibits the texture of a plastic toy.',\n",

You’re willing to look past the inconveniences when you tear off a ragged, sesame-studded chunk of sourdough tabrizi and dunk it into what looks like a bland, monochromatic yogurt sauce. That puckery dairy hides a dose of refreshment in the form of diced cucumbers — a typical pairing at local Iranian restaurants — and a less common squish of sweetness from a fistful of plump golden raisins, an addition that’s common in the chef’s native Isfahan.',\n",

The family-like collaboration yielded an unmistakably sleek venue: Gray tables, walnut chairs, calligraphy carved into the walls, a bathroom plastered with pulpy Iranian movie posters from the 1970s, and swooping arches in the bar area that recall the great Safavid architecture of the 15th century. The stark white bar acts as a stunning background for a bright rose fizz, a pink-hued highball that transforms gin, lemon, cream, and egg white into pure, fragrant, effervescent froth.

In this regard, Sofreh’s more contemporary cooking — and bare tabletops — functions as a compelling change of pace. Alikhani’s cooking also serves as a vital counterpoint to the city’s larger Middle Eastern culinary scene, where the diverse foodways of the Muslim majority region are often filtered through the lenses of Israeli-born chefs like Einat Admony, Meir Adoni, and Eyal Shani.',\n",

Instead, she slowly cooks a melange of plum, saffron, and barberries by themselves, preparing the chicken separately, on the griddle a la minute. The result is a supremely crispy and flavorful bird, with a sauce underneath that bursts with muted sweetness. She does the same for halibut, letting the pan-seared fish speak for itself, New American-style, atop a puree of onions, herbs, and tamarind. The mixture vibrates with a type of sourness that is quintessentially Iranian and straight up Wildair.  ',\n",
       "  'If rice is where Sofreh (usually) excels, desserts are where it dominates; its saffron ice cream is simply smoother than elsewhere. Its yogurt parfait, topped with a neon orange-carrot jam, could easily take on spendier versions at fashionable breakfast spots around town. Its puckery faloodeh, icy vermicelli with rosewater and lemon sorbet, lacks the cloying sweetness that brings down this affair at other restaurants.

',\n",
       "  'One in five foreign-born New Yorkers hails from the non-Hispanic Caribbean, which explains why the city packs such an ample supply of Trinidadian roti, Haitian griot, and Belizean curried shrimp. Jerk in particular thrives along Nostrand and Flatbush avenues in Brooklyn — the heart of the city’s West Indian community. The culinary style traces its mouth-stinging lineage to Jamaica; it developed in the 1700s as a fusion between the pit-cooking techniques of escaped West African slaves and the native Taino spice rubs designed to prevent meat spoilage. ',\n",
       "  'The question of exactly what jerk is in the 21st century, however, has become “open for interpretation,” Island & Spice editor Rochelle Oliver wrote for the Times in July. “Is it a flavor? Is it the ingredients? Is it the way the meat is cooked? The truth lies somewhere in the middle,” she argued. In Jamaica, jerk typically involves seasoning whole hogs or chicken with a pungent mix of ingredients that grow in the island nation’s verdant interior: scallions, thyme, allspice, and chiles. The meats are then slowly smoked over resinous pimento branches, either underground or in a steel drum. In New York, this is the style loosely employed by LoLo’s in Harlem and Glady’s in Crown Heights and, as of this spring, in Prospect-Lefferts — more on that later enterprise in a bit.',\n",
       "  'Cooking with hardwood fuel, alas, requires expensive ventilation systems and emissions filters. That means jerking in the city often means forgoing the smoker in favor of a gas grill or oven. Miss Lily’s in Manhattan, which sells a bird that tastes like any backyard chicken, is an example of how to do this New York style of jerking poorly. Peppa’s is an example of how to do it expertly.',\n",

He opened the first Peppa’s just south of Prospect Park in 2004 and has since expanded the business with his brother Jason and his daughter Jessica, who share ownership.

The Hussey family is striking while the iron is hot; fast-casual chicken concepts are proliferating, from David Chang’s Fuku to Seamus Mullen’s Whirlybird to the poultry-centric Made Nice. Peppa’s is better. ',\n",

The meat is scored, washed in vinegar, marinated overnight in a rub whose ingredients no one would reveal to me, and grilled for approximately 45 minutes. Certain bites pack a clean poultry tang; others are earthy and woodsy from the flames. The skin comes off with ease, yielding to a gentle chew like a charred campfire marshmallow. The hot sauce causes your tongue to tingle or five minutes afterwards, maybe six. You dampen the heat with a forkful of coconut rice, or a sweet, craggy festival — essentially sweet, fried cornbread. The near-perfect jerk here is the type of preparation that calls into question spending $60 on a chicken for two at a passable brasserie, or $10 on the bland, overcooked birds at Whole Foods. ',\n",

For nearly half a decade, Michael Jacober, a Rhode Island native not of West Indian descent, has been the unlikely public face of the popular Caribbean restaurant. But with the opening of the Prospect-Lefferts outpost this spring, Jacober has stepped back, letting the chef, a native St. Lucian who’s been involved in virtually every recipe Glady’s has ever developed, oversee the space as a co-owner.

He prepares all the meats over a custom smoker that sits behind the counter, a rectangular steel edifice built by a guy called Alabama Joe. He cooks pork and chicken at 275 degrees for about 2.5 hours — hotter and faster than most American ’cue. The wood selection, in turn, departs a bit from Jamaican traditions. Felix uses a mix of domestic maple and ash, alongside traditional pimento chips, which impart a flavor that some liken to bay leaves.',\n",
       "  'The jerk, sweet and vaguely piney with expertly rendered fats, calibrated heat, and bracing pungency, is so good that Glady’s is as much in conversation with Peppa’s as it is with a place like Hometown or Mighty Quinn’s. The comparison is important. There’s long been a tendency to overcategorize affordable or unfamiliar foodstuffs, to relegate them to a series of polite “best of brackets” rather than to critique them within the larger context of the city’s dining traditions. And so in the case of Glady’s, its place within the jerk community is just one story; the bigger picture is that it’s one of the the city’s most accomplished barbecue restaurants.

Glady’s 1.0 cooks with a combi-oven, an expensive device that lets Felix bombard his meats with wet heat, dry heat, and the pleasant fumes of wood chips. The proper smoker at Glady’s 2.0, by contrast, makes a noticeable difference, imbuing the chicken ($9.50) with a deeper mahogany hue. That exterior is wonderfully leathery, a toothsome counterpart to the soft meat. The flavor is all sweet smoke at first — the poultry flavor isn’t as assertive as at Peppa’s — followed by the clove-like warmth of the allspice berry and then bucking heat of the Scotch bonnet. The tongue vibrates in such a way that recalls good Sichuan fare.',\n",

The painkiller ($10), that classic mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, and nutmeg, is somewhat sugary on its own, and rightly so.

And then it all slowly disappears as the server picks up a tiny kettle and pours an opaque seafood broth; the soup’s ferric hue suggests day turning to dusk. ',\n",
       "  'To be precise, that’s how it all looks in fancy online photos. It was served to me differently. A waiter walked over and dumped in the broth before I had a chance to see what was inside.

There’s Jungsik, with its $225 caviar and wagyu-laced tasting menus; Jeju, a sleek noodle shop slinging some of the city’s most elegant (and fiery) ramyun broths; Oiji, a breathtaking small-plates place that drizzles gochugaru butter over abalone; and Cote, the country’s only Michelin-starred Korean barbecue spot, a venue as famous for its prime galbi as its pink and boozy frosé.',\n",

And the steamed layer of tofu exhibited the softness of a marshmallow but packed an earthiness that conjured up visions of roasted corn. When kitchen and service staff get this dish right, and I’m betting they will, it will be one of the city’s great seafood preparations.',\n",

Every few minutes a loud hiss and sizzle echoes through the room, a cloud of steam rises up over someone’s table, and for a few brief seconds, the entire restaurant smells of caramel. This is the result of a waiter pouring soy over a hot metal plate, the final flourish for a dish of foie gras atop crispy rice. This tableside pomp, alas, is for naught; the kitchen sears the duck liver to a meaty medium rare, but the rice is simply a disc of hot mush, with little of the promised crunch.',\n",

Also visible through the doors, on one night, is a crowd of 10 folks, some of them standing around waiting to be acknowledged by a host.',\n",
       "  'Dining here can also be stressful. One staffer might forget your drink, while another might take away your jar of rice beer away before it’s finished. If you’re sitting at the counter, servers sometimes talk across you to the bartender, as if they were patrons at a Murray Hill watering hole waiting to get a vodka soda.

It’s a modern Korean spot that produces as much reading material as it does food.

Nothing is complicated or ambiguous about the masterful dish; the components are enjoyable without additional explanation.',\n",

And a month after the meal, I read that little essay, about how the sauce owes its complexity to an aged soy called jinjang — that’s been fermented for five years. So what was apparently just another delicious dish is actually, the diner understands, something more meaningful and contextual, a blending of the new and the old.',\n",

Neither option does much good when you’re trying to prime your palate for a one-bite course, or when you want something more detailed than an iPhone pic to jog your memory following a long dinner. Atomix’s cards solve that problem, letting guests focus on minor components they might overlook, like the dried sea cucumber innards used to season thinly sliced beef.',\n",

But Atomix’s use of them comes across less like a crutch, and more like a genuine innovation. The chef whittles halibut into a round disc. The first bite is soft, flaky, mild. A second bite reveals a layer of foie gras terrine underneath, imparting a buttery oomph to the neutral fish. A third bite causes the liver to spill out, clouding the surrounding pool of squash dashi with its pink hue. ',\n",

And it’s not in a hotel with a built-in clientele, or downtown with guaranteed foot traffic, or at San Francisco International Airport with a steady stream of travelers.

       "  'When Salazar debuted in 2016, it shook up the LA dining scene. Located near the Los Angeles River in a semi-industrial neighborhood known as Frogtown, the restaurant combined Mexican recipes and wood grilling in a way the City of Angels hadn’t seen before. The menu evoked the cuisine of the Sonoran Desert, and Salazar’s dining area was a dusty expanse of tree-shaded ground that rose up among the surrounding freeways. No better place to chill outdoors with a couple of charred carne asada tacos and a tumbler of cerveza.',\n",
       "  'It was an experience worth having again, and one that I’ve sought at various New York restaurants in spite of certain climatological limitations. Claro, though the owner never stepped foot in Salazar, came close, showing that the Gowanus Canal and the Los Angeles River maybe aren’t all that different. A wood-fired hearth flickered in a backyard filled with tables beneath vine-covered trellises, while cicadas buzzed merrily in the background. But though it was outstanding, it still didn’t quite recapture my LA experience.',\n",
       "  'Another promising contender was Gitano, an open air pop-up on Canal Street that actually originated in Tulum. There, though, the wood-fired bill of fare was half-hearted, and the atmosphere that of a battlefield combat hospital.',\n",
       "  'All that brings us to Oxomoco. Named after the Aztec goddess of the night, this restaurant recently planted itself deep in Brooklyn’s Greenpoint — not exactly Frogtown, but close enough when the setting sun shoots directly up Greenpoint Avenue from the East River on a sweltering summer evening.',\n",
       "  'There’s a spare front yard with umbrella-shaded tables that you wish had a tree or two, and a high ceilinged interior from which the vines called devil’s ivy hang down from the skylights. With its cream and beige color scheme, the room seems lavish despite its battered walls and general lack of decoration. The executive chef is Justin Bazdarich, who previously hatched the pizzeria Speedy Romeo. ',\n",
       "  'Besides all the ways it resembles LA’s Salazar, the restaurant is yet another example of the accelerating appreciation of Mexican food in New York — in part due to the taquerias and decades of immigrant participation in restaurant kitchens. Now, the city has an increasing awareness of regional Mexican cuisines and a willingness among diners to pay more for it, as with Italian and Japanese fare in the past.',\n",
       "  'Though some of the most notable restaurants serving ambitious, expensive versions of the cuisine are run by Mexican chefs (Cosme, Casa Enrique, Atla), it’s a scene that’s also conspicuously filled with people who have come to enjoy the cuisine as outsiders — like Bazdarich and his business partner Chris Walton, self-described “white kids from Missouri.” Claro and Gitano are also examples, as is the Empellon empire, where Oxomoco’s chef de cuisine Matt Conroy once worked. Here, Bazdarich pulled from his memories of traveling to the country; he and Conroy also brought on Oaxacan-born chef Kaelin Ulrich, son of famed Oaxacan chef and teacher Susana Trilling, to consult during the initial months of menu creation.',\n",
       "  'Despite the goofy unevenness of Speedy Romeo’s menu, Bazdarich has really hit the culinary jackpot at Oxomoco, where the tacos are every bit as good as the ones at Salazar. ',\n",
       "  'Best is barbacoa. At Oxomoco, lamb that has been grilled over wood, slow-cooked, and then loaded into a coarse-textured corn tortilla that will remind you of Los Angeles’s. A relish made of pipicha — a feathery herb that tastes like dirty mint — crowns the jiggly meat, as does a squash blossom that doesn’t add much but sure looks pretty riding shotgun. Sadly, the price of $16 for two tacos is exactly twice the cost at Salazar.',\n",
       "  'Other Oxomoco tacos worth tasting include pig cheek with green avocado salsa, flank steak with smoked eggplant relish and rubbery cotija cheese (now served with caramelized onions), and tempura-fried hake (now it’s shrimp), reminding us that the Baja Peninsula, the original home of the fish taco, is considered part of the Sonoran Desert. But a vegetarian taco of beets and potatoes intended to resemble chorizo is bland and boring.',\n",
       "  'Other antojitos, or corn-based staples, are worth ordering, on a menu twice as long as Salazar’s. Whatever you do, don’t miss the creamy charred-carrot tamales, which come pooled in a verdant sauce. The steak tartare tostada ($16), exceedingly fresh beef cut into a ragged dice, is preferable to a tuna tostada that makes too-lavish use of soy sauce, which clashes with the corn tortilla. In fact, I’d skip anything featuring raw fish at Oxomoco, including the hamachi aguachile. What New York City really needs is a full-blown Mexican cevicheria.',\n",
       "  'Instead, head for the salads, which are an unexpected delight. The heirloom tomato salad ($16) hoists little heaps of snowy queso fresco among its peaks; the dish is one of the most cooling things imaginable. A Caesar salad made with grilled Romaine is not the most original idea in the borough, but here, this commonplace dish has been turned into a top-notch treat, sodden with dressing and tasting almost as meaty as steak.',\n",
       "  'In fact, the chefs have proven they will smoke almost anything, including fruits that go into the cocktails. That extends, of course, to the full-blown entrees, of which there are only three. All are shareable, and two are spectacular enough you should forego some of the tacos to get them. The whole branzino ($42) has been splayed, grilled, and brushed with a piquant green sauce based the fresh Mexican herb hoja santa. It’s accompanied by Oaxacan mole amarillo, which doesn’t belong with the fish, but makes a nice dip for tortillas.',\n",

But from the first sip of my Coriander to the last scrape of olive oil cake through its puddle of roasted strawberry vinaigrette, I was a believer. The cocktail is casually elegant, garnished with a white blossom; it smells like a garden and tastes like gin — citrusy gin with coriander-infused curacao and housemade herbes de Provence bitters. And the fat slice of cake is as light and fluffy and life-changing as fresh snow on a Utah slope, adorned with a heavenly globe of malted yogurt gelato.',\n",

Hailing from Sonoma County, it’s aged for 17 days, marinated for two, then slow-roasted on the wood fire and topped by a shrub of wild watercress. Thick, meaty medallions fanned across the plate, fat blissfully intact. It’s a hefty, yet tender, undertaking for two.',\n",

It is fleshy and light, more silky than fishy, and blows away anything served from a jar.  ',\n",

Each dish is marked with a little bubble on the menu as fatta a macchina in casa (made with an in-house pasta machine) or fatta a mano (made by hand). The orecchiette with broccoli rabe and fennel sausage sounded so standard I almost skipped it, but that would’ve been a serious mistake. The chewy, thick thimbles, tossed in goat butter, trumped every other orecchiette I’ve tried. Another big hit was the bigoli nero, a bowl of delightfully dense squid-ink noodles tangled with octopus and Dungeness crab and littlenecks, scattered with the crunch of toasted breadcrumbs. Only the mafaldini — squiggle-edged lasagna-like lemony noodles in a bland fava-leaf pesto — was a miss.

It is creamy and dreamy and something you’d think chopped liver, by its very nature, could never be: pretty. A velvety mound ringed like a hippie chick in petals of purple daikon and pickled onion, it came flanked by a single, seed-studded slab of Roman matzo that, if boxed, would put Manischewitz out of business. (Even if Nayfeld does use a reduction of its sweet wine to make the liver.) There was more liver than matzo, which was a little irritating, until I remembered I still had my fork.

It’s the food and the drinks and the desserts. Not to mention the industry rock stars behind it: Nayfeld and his fellow Eleven Madison Park alum and Beard-winning pastry chef Angela Pinkerton — aided by co-owner Matthew Brewer and bar director Christopher Longoria, who are also ones to watch.

       "  'At Frenchette, Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson’s sleek Tribeca hotspot, something unusual happens while patrons engage in the dreaded ritual of waiting for seats at a packed bar: A server walks up, presents a menu, and takes your drink order on the spot. No credit cards are requisitioned. No one behind the bar is summoned. And a few minutes later a waiter returns with, say, a Calvados and tonic — a bitter, boozy, apple-tinged highball — or a fizzy glass of sparkling gamay. ',\n",
       "  'The quiet courtesy lets guests focus on what’s important, which is contemplating the list of natural wines or the menu of creative Gallic fare — uni deviled eggs, anyone? — rather than forcing them to flag down a bartender or shout past fellow patrons. It’s the type of generosity that makes one think: Maybe Frenchette is worth the hour-long wait.',\n",
       "  '“Bad food is always more tolerable than bad service.” That’s one of the axioms of hospitality industry thinking, as well as a brilliant explainer as to why your grandparents’ burnt meatloaf always manages to please: because it’s served with love! And the good news is that service, in the mechanical sense of getting stuff to a table in a timely fashion, is generally practiced at a high level throughout the city. ',\n",
       "  'But a larger goal of hospitality — making guests feel warm and welcome in an unfamiliar environment where they’ll spend a lot of money — is a trickier affair. Nasr and Hanson are more skilled than the overseers at other fashionable hangouts at creating a sense of belonging, a heck of a thing given that the duo hail from Minetta Tavern, a Keith McNally restaurant whose earliest days were a classic example of how not to treat humans.',\n",
       "  'Frenchette’s cocktail service is part of the feel-good equation. Another part is that the hosts seem genuinely excited to see guests at the door. And then there’s the fact that walk-ins aren’t just encouraged, they get about a third of the restaurant’s 105 seats; there are few better ways to make a first-time patron feel excluded than by telling them a nominally approachable cafe or brunch spot books up weeks out.',\n",
       "  'Hospitality is vital anywhere, but particularly clutch here, as it creates a safety net for a style of gastronomy that’s sometimes a standard deviation removed from the brasserie norm. Instead of shrimp cocktail, the kitchen sends out warm spot prawns tossed in thyme and butter; guests are instructed to eat the entire crustacean, chomping through a shell that shatters like the crisp exterior of a kouign amann. And scrambled eggs, as rich as creme anglaise, come topped not with truffles but a tiny pile of sautéed snails, amping up the buttery fats and adding an umami-studded chew. ',\n",
       "  'These are the types of dishes that make it tough to be dismissive of Frenchette, that make it hard to ask whether “we need another self-consciously luxurious brasserie, in a city so full of them,” as another critic wrote. The truth is that Nasr and Hanson have given New York something decidedly different. They’ve built a modern French spot in conversation with the ambitiously lean neo-bistros of Paris, a venue whose culinary exploits can feel closer to a creative small plates place than a more staid institution like Balthazar.',\n",
       "  'Yes, the dining room is a study in architectural riches, with red leather banquettes, white curtains, glossy sapele wood paneling, and sinuous liquor shelves that recall the space age curves of the 1960s.

       "  'How many other French restaurants are grilling blowfish tails, dousing them in chile butter and letting the patrons gnaw the succulent flesh off the bone? They are the chicken wings of the sea. And they go perfectly with a glass of pet-nat, a class of wines whose bubbles are produced without the addition of yeast or sugar, as is the case with the methode traditionelle. The result is a low-ish alcohol content and a level of fizz gentler than most Champagnes.',\n",
       "  'Jorge Riera, late of Wildair, is the man behind the natural wine list, and a large reason why Frenchette is compelling as it is. The bearded beverage director roams the dining room, deciphering obscure grapes to willing imbibers, and pouring restrained reds, skin contact orange wines, and cloudy whites that sometimes boast the oxidized flavor of sherry. But what makes the wines truly special is something larger: The ever-changing selections end up forcing a more honest conversation between the guest and the waiter or sommelier.',\n",
       "  'If Minetta rose to fame as one of the city’s more expensive purveyors of dry-aged steaks and hamburgers, Frenchette seems destined to be a touch more accessible, with two of the signature red meat preparations offered at $34. The first and best is the duck frites; the kitchen takes the canard breasts and steams them, roasts them in a cage, and then crisps them up a second time on pickup. The silky fats and iron-y flesh are a welcome alternative to the working class indulgence that is steak frites, though Frenchette does a fine number on that staple as well. The chefs rotate among a series of cuts, from bavette, to onglet, to the petit tender. The last of the bunch, also known as teres major, sports the soft mouthfeel of a filet but exhibits a more robust beefiness. ',\n",
       "  'The sun-drenched flavors of the Cote D’Azur is a running theme here, which explains the fish soup — a tomato-laced misfire packing as little flavor as Campbell’s Manhattan clam chowder. Lemon- and bottarga-slicked spaghetti is a more skillful evocation of the Mediterranean, with the fragrant citrus taming the mineral overtones of the cured roe. Lamb, in turn, is broken down into the standard Provencal daube-style stew; cubes of fork tender shoulder meat sit in a summery broth of red wine and lamb jus. ',\n",

Its chef, Reem Assil, hopes to foster community and conversation through food — the Middle Eastern food of her upbringing, which she says has been invisibilized in America: warm, chewy mana’eesh; smoky, charred mutabbal; silky, thick labneh; braised shakriyah the size of my leg.',\n",
       "  'She got off to a controversial start with her first business, Reem’s. It’s an “Arab street corner bakery” which opened in Fruitvale Village last year with support from local food business incubator La Cocina. Presiding over the counter there is a larger-than-life mural of Rasmea Odeh, a Palestinian leader convicted, some say questionably, by an Israeli court for a 1969 deadly bombing at a Jerusalem supermarket. Within Reem’s first weeks, there were public protests, death threats by pro-Israel fringe groups. But there were also rave reviews for her za’atar-dusted flatbreads and, ultimately, a James Beard nomination. It was a swift rise for someone who cut her teeth as a community organizer, not in fancy kitchens.',\n",
       "  'But when Assil opened Dyafa, there was no provocative mural. Instead, she opened it in partnership with nationally recognized chef Daniel Patterson on a spring day in Jack London Square, free of political drama. ',\n",
       "  'At that time, Assil herself had a different kind of drama: a brand-new baby. As a mother of a one-month-old, I could barely find time to shower. Assil opened a 105-seat upscale restaurant. “She’s a superhuman,” our server explained, setting down a woven basket of puffy, piping-hot, pita. Tearing into it, I agree. ',\n",
       "  'Moreover: she’s a talented chef. Born and raised in suburban Boston by a Syrian father and Palestinian mother, she has made it her mission to make her family’s cuisine seen, enhancing many Americans’ idea of casual Middle Eastern fare beyond the reductive falafel-shawarma realm. (Although Reem’s does make a mean falafel sandwich. It’s wrapped in blistered flatbread with fresh tomatoes, cucumbers and mint — all dripping with a messy green swirl of spicy zhoug and super-garlicky tahini that, quite literally, stayed with me for days.)',\n",
       "  ' You won’t find falafel on the lunch or dinner menu at Dyafa. There isn’t much overlap with the bakery at all, actually, other than a couple of mezzes, the mana’eesh, and that dreamy-creamy labneh. You’ll pay a bit more here, where diners watch sailboats bobbing in the bay instead of BART trains rolling by. At Dyafa, for example, the milky-white mound of labneh is served in gorgeous, ceramic bowls, handmade by potters in Jerusalem. Looking like a savory Dairy Queen blizzard, it’s hollowed and heaped with wisps of radish, flowering coriander, and the crunch of sugar snap peas. Meanwhile, at $16, the hummus is actually twice the price of Reem’s, but for good reason: It comes flecked with cured sumac and sunken with meaty, crisped hunks of spiced lamb. ',\n",
       "  'If Reem’s fare is considered everyday “Arabic street food”, the food at Dyafa, which means “hospitality,” is a family-style feast: The kind where you just keep eating. I devoured certain share plates all by myself. Like the loubieh, a wild tangle of yellow and green summer beans dressed in a chunky sauce of serrano-spiked roasted tomatoes and crumbs of toasted pita. And the kibbeh nayyeh, a fleshy, Lebanese-style mash of raw lamb bound by bulgur, and emboldened by lemon zest, baharat, and the heat of burnt cinnamon. It’s a tartare with flavor as flamboyant as the hot-pink triangles of pickled turnips scattered on top. ',\n",

Cocktails with ingredients like medjool dates and Greek yogurt and za’atar. Cocktails, like the Wattani Habibi, a Gatorade-yellow, Negroni-like number served up with white vermouth. And the Mexi-Pali, a tall, fluorescent fuchsia, tequila-, beet-, and tamarind-infused marvel. Cocktails that, on all three visits, took so long to arrive that I thought they might never come.',\n",
       "  'By the time our server presents our suhoons, or larger plates, we’re already near-stuffed with mezzes, including the batata harra: humble potatoes, twice fried, bronzed and crisped, with cilantro, garlic, aleppo pepper, and a kick of harissa-spiked yogurt sauce. It’s like Lebanon’s answer to patatas bravas, and I loved it. We’d also scarf both a halloumi-and-squash-topped flatbread and an entire basket of pita. Still, we request a second basket, because how can we not? ',\n",
       "  'All of which makes the grand entrance of the shakriyah almost comical. It’s a humongous, halal lamb shank, braised for three or fours in a baharat spice blend; all but its protruding-bone smothered by gremolata, almond slivers, and a garlicky yogurt sauce, sitting pretty in a mushy, casserole-like tub of Arabic rice. The meat tears easily off the bone, but I find it too cinnamon-y sweet to eat. Which is probably for the best, really, given how full I am. ',\n",
       "  'The lamb leaves me longing for the sharper, more distinctive flavors of the mezze. So do the mostly muted flavors in three of the other four main dishes. The samaka harra, a whole roasted rock cod, is the highlight, arched and aglitter with ground chiles, it’s surprisingly mild flavor offset by a bright, lemony cucumber-bulgur salad. The mjusakhan, chunks of tangy, sumac-tinged chicken confit topped with pickled onion and shreds of purple cabbage, is nourishing and visually arresting, but overall tastes less impressive than it looks: It comes plopped in the center of a yet another circle of unleavened bread, a giant floppy disk called markook — so plan ahead and dial back your cries for “More, pita please!” accordingly.

       "  'And if you’re a Reem’s regular, perhaps, adjust your expectations too. Whereas the bakery feels deeply personal, Dyafa feels more Daniel Patterson. The airy space housed his failing Haven before he and Assil joined forces to open this restaurant, and despite Arabic tunes and pretty terracotta floor tiling, it still looks much the same. ',\n",
       "  'Without a provocative mural or posters promoting prison strikes, the decor at Dyafa is tamer, more typical. There’s the go-to walnut wood, leafy plants, and rattan light fixtures.

       "  'Momofuku Ko, the two-Michelin-starred jewel of David Chang’s empire, has always peppered its tastings with high-wire whimsy, from teetering trout roe mille-feuilles to basil-seed lily ponds to shavings of frozen foie gras that melt like snowflakes. And yet in 2018, the restaurant’s most Matrix-like mind-bender of a dish is somehow the humble chicken drumstick. ',\n",
       "  'The chicken is fried four times, at rigorous two-minute intervals, in a slurry of cornstarch, flour, vodka, and beer. It is re-battered in between each fry, and finished with a brushing of mirin, yuzu, and green Tabasco. What the chef places in front of you, on a gray ceramic plate, isn’t so much a normal drumstick as it is a puffy, golden, Yogi-Bear-picnic-basket fantasy of what a chicken wing should look like. ',\n",
       "  'The drumstick is cold. This is by design. Generations of humans have enjoyed chilled fried chicken in more familiar environs — one thinks of a Sunday picnic in a grassy park — but it’s hard to think of a refrigerator bird with this much crunch. The firm skin shatters like a Butterfinger bar, while the sweet-spicy-citrusy glaze, an American take on yuzu kosho, counteracts all the salty fats of the meat. ',\n",
       "  'Normally, the price of a meal at Ko is $255, reservations only. The quadruple-fried wing, however, is only available in Ko’s new a la carte bar room, where it sells for just $7, walk-ins only.',\n",
       "  'Ten years ago, as the U.S. economy slipped into its longest downward spiral since World War II, Chang opened the original Ko on First Avenue. With an $85 menu, it felt like a permanent recession special of a restaurant — at least by fancypants standards. The chef, barely 30, was already a legend for redefining ambitious American cuisine as affordable, Asian-accented small plates at his nearby Ssäm Bar. ',\n",
       "  'But Ko’s nose-thumbing at the haute establishment was even bolder. Everything about the place was (classically) wrong: the cramped counter seating, the expletive-spewing chefs, the alt-rock soundtrack, the fried McDonald’s-style apple pies, the online-only reservations. It felt as if the Ko revolution would democratize fine dining forever. ',\n",
       "  'It would not. In fact, there’s never been a worse time in the past decade to seek out accessible luxury than now. ',\n",
       "  'New York is still one of the U.S.’s culinary capitals, but the Changian notion of democratized fine dining has proved illusory. Once-approachable tasting joints (Aska, Brooklyn Fare, Atera) have skyrocketed into the upper stratosphere of prices. Major Food Group pivoted from $50 set menus at Torrisi Italian Specialties (RIP) to power spots so expensive they don’t even publish the prices online. And what’s replacing those more reasonable-ish venues? Nothing, really; dinner at any one of the city’s dozen or so new omakase joints will easily run $350-plus per person.',\n",
       "  'Momofuku Ko, in turn, relocated to a larger space off the Bowery, adopted more refined dishes (RIP fried apple pies), and eventually started charging roughly $1,000 for a wine-paired dinner for two. I awarded it four stars in 2015; it’s without question one of the city’s great restaurants. But in this rich person’s playland that is contemporary New York, Ko’s evolution meant that cash-strapped gourmands had lost a sanctuary.',\n",
       "  'Ko’s bar room, which opened in February, marks the return of that sanctuary.',\n",
       "  'There are 15 table seats, a small island for stand-up cocktailing, hefty soundproofing, and the centerpiece, a blonde eight-seat bar. You’ll want to sit at that bar, as it overlooks the new test kitchen, where chef Sean Gray and others glaze duck pies with painter’s brushes and grill crepes over the binchotan. ',\n",
       "  'The crepe ($8) is made from from the same sourdough starter that fuels the bread service in the main room. Here, it imparts the savory pastry with such a remarkable tang it recalls the acidity of injera. The grilling gives it a distinct sweetness and a chew not dissimilar to a fruit roll-up, while a brushing of aged butter adds a marked cheesy funk. There is no other bread course in the city like it. ',\n",
       "  'It’s also hard to think of a New York dish comparable to the tandoori firefly squid. Cooks sear the torpedo-shaped creatures — they look like miniaturized beasts from a Guillermo del Toro flick — in a blend of coriander, paprika, garlic, onions, and soy. They exhibit a handsome bronze hue and pack the flavors of smoke and brine — with a bit of squishiness thanks to their oceanic guts. Equally stunning is the chaud-froid of shrimp. Gray rips the shells off of raw spot prawns, dredges the slithery bodies through a sambal-spiked gelee, then tops them off with the fried head, a warm, crunchy counterpoint to all the cool crustacean creaminess.',\n",
       "  'Pinning down precisely what strain of global eclecticism a Momofuku restaurant specializes in is a particular type of modern trivia question. At the moment, chef Gray’s food is modern American-French-Japanese with nods to South and Southeast Asia, all served in a style that’s more refined and a touch more expensive than Ssäm Bar. Most dishes on the 16-item menu, written in hand in a cute little notebook, are under $35. That’s not a bad price for what’s nearly a four-star meal.',\n",
       "  'The team at Ko built the bar room to “create a space for tasting-menu research and development,” per its website. That’s a heck of a mission statement; fine dining empires typically begin their innovations in more upscale environs, only later letting them trickle down to the masses. Grant Achatz’s famous black-truffle explosion, now available for $18 in the Time Warner Center, started as a bite at the $500-per-person Alinea. And Wolfgang Puck’s smoked-salmon pizza, not an uncommon sight at his airport kiosks, started its lifespan at his once uber-exclusive Spago.',\n",
       "  'So in a world where culinary experimentation can command caviar-like markups, it’s refreshing to know that the cheaper half of Ko is inspiring the more expensive half. That’s all the more appropriate for a restaurant group like Momofuku, which started slinging ramen before it launched a tasting-menu venue, rather than the other way around.',\n",
       "  'One night at Ko’s bar, halibut arrived in a dashi with soybeans. Garnishing the fillet was a confit of the fish’s own skin and cheeks, cooked down with pepperoncini and sumac. The chewy bits were mahogany in color and packed the smoky, umami richness of reconstituted bonito flakes. A few nights later the same fish came as a round cake, laced with verdant chiles and slathered in a cauliflower porridge that somehow tasted like daikon. ',\n",
       "  'Gray says he might adapt both dishes for the tasting — perhaps serving the cake next to the dashi alone, with the confit as a condiment. This is what makes the bar at Ko so damn fascinating: It gives diners a peek into the restaurant’s works in progress, near-blockbusters, and potential failures, without pledging one’s rent check to the full menu. ',\n",
       "  'And then there are the more straightforward dishes: an endive and frisee salad as boring as any other, a competent blend of foie gras and duck in puff pastry ($45), and a charcoal-grilled strip loin ($34) packing as much dry-aged tang as steakhouse versions costing twice as much.',\n",
       "  'Guests of the main dining room, for now, will miss out on some distinctly thrilling bar fare, like the mandarin tart tatin, with shavings of sharp cheddar that counteract the bitter oranges, as well as the Naked Pruner cheesecake, an egg white-heightened loaf that melts on the tongue like the venue’s famous foie gras. ',\n",
       "  'The bar might not be the four-star side of Ko — service can be a touch uneven here — but the fact that the walk-in half of the restaurant is the more exciting half suggests that Chang and Gray remain committed to Momofuku’s iconoclastic, accessible roots. Rock on.',\n",

Texas barbecues like Hill Country dole out slices of white supermarket bread, while in Uzbek kebab joints like Cheburechnaya, the parabolic cracker-thin flatbread noni toki will probably make an appearance. So you shouldn’t be shocked when your Nepalese barbecue rolls in on a bed of puffed rice.',\n",
       "  'Located right on Queens Boulevard, the main drag of Sunnyside, Bajeko Sekuwa (“Grandfather’s Barbecue”) is the first international branch of a restaurant originating in the mountainous republic of Nepal, sandwiched between India and Tibet. The chain traces its roots to a grilled meat shack that opened 38 years ago near the Kathmandu airport. It attracted enthusiastic customers — according to the website — but also flocks of crows that proved such a nuisance to aviation that the shack had to be moved.',\n",

The dining room sports a peaked ceiling, rustic wood rafters, and a lighting motif that suggests glowing village windows. A bar at the end dispenses cocktails, wine, and beer, while a native kitchen is mocked up by the front door.

       "  'Single item servings of barbecue known as sekuwas ($9.95 to $14.95) form the crux of the menu. As mentioned previously, these charcoal-grilled meats are served on puffed rice, which absorbs the grease and juices. They’re sided with a small undressed salad and a few pieces of root-vegetable achar (pickle). Due to agricultural conditions and a nomadic past, vegetables remain limited in Nepalese cuisine.',\n",
       "  'Your barbecue choices are confined to chicken, goat, hyakula (mutton), and bandel (wild boar). Pick any of the last three. One of the most appealing features of Bajeko Sekuwa is that it presents meats that are underexposed here. Yes, the mutton is as funky as you might wish, while the boar favors fatty belly meat, almost tasting like pig but not quite. (The menu also offers the same boar in steamed form with seasoned salt and a chile dip. Skip it.) Sadly, the actual Nepalese barbecue part of Bajeko Sekuwa’s menu is small compared to the rest of the menu.',\n",
       "  'The balance of the bill of fare falls into three categories, including distinctively Nepalese dishes, Indian-Chinese offerings, and food from northern India. The latter includes tandoori selections that, I suppose, might be considered part of the restaurant’s barbecue mission. Into this category fall pink and slightly charred tiger prawns, a delectable deal at $15.95 for seven. The usual tandoori chicken and its clay pit pals are also provided.',\n",
       "  'Bajeko Sekuwa distinguishes itself from the dozen or so Nepalese cafes in Jackson Heights and Elmhurst by being more meat oriented. Nevertheless, a handful of starchier dishes are available, which are the main focus of most Himalayan menus in Queens. These include the wonderful bhatmas sandheko ($5.95) — crunchy fried soybeans tossed with scallions, garlic, and lemon juice to make one of the world’s best bar snacks.

But the thukpa are a big disappointment. Instead of the usual ragged homemade noodles, which look like they were torn by a cook in a hurry, this restaurant’s version seems like overcooked spaghetti.',\n",

The bone soup ($5.95) is a delight, resembling the bone broth so newly popular in Greenwich Village, only loaded with goat pieces. “Tauko fry” is a catalog of goat face parts that will leave you trying to distinguish ear, cheek, and lip.

But the packed Le Sia asks just $15 for a pound of crawfish, $30 for whole lobsters, and $5 more for Dungeness. An entire dinner for two will doubtfully cost more than $100 after tax and tip.',\n",
       "  'Le Sia, a surprisingly accessible seafood spot, translates as “Happy Prawn.” The Mandarin sia, or xia, also hints at the word for crawfish, xiaolongxia, the restaurant’s speciality. The bottom-feeding crustaceans, sometimes known as mountain lobsters, crawdads, yabbies, or mudbugs, have been part of Gulf Coast Cajun cuisine for centuries, but are still relatively new to the China; they were brought from the States through Japan as food for bullfrogs in the 1920s. And while crawfish were once the bane of regional rice farmers, they have become, largely over the past few decades, part of a multibillion-dollar industry that employs over 5 million, primarily in the Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangsu provinces.

Gloves are licked, noses are blown, and chile-triggered sinuses are cleared. The Financial Times reported last year that this style of crawfish eating was highly social because it effectively prevented people from checking their phones; I’m embarrassed to say it didn’t stop me or anyone else in the room from doing precisely that.',\n",

We were told to crumble the accompanying “everything” lace cracker over the top and mix it all together.

       "  'Caviar is expensive. But it’s also easy. It doesn’t need to be deveined and pushed through a tamis like foie gras. It doesn’t benefit from a deft tableside shaving over wood-fired pizza like with truffles. The lightly-salted roe of a mature sturgeon simply needs to be opened like a can of sardines and consumed. ',\n",
       "  'The most meaningful thing a chef typically does to caviar is mark it up. That’s not to say there’s no place for it in restaurants, but almost every high-end spot that’s wowed me with a composed caviar course has also gutted me with an experiment gone awry, often involving a modicum of fish eggs acting as an expensive form of salt. ',\n",
       "  'Still, there are impressive exceptions. One of them is Uchu, a kaiseki spot on the Lower East Side with a penchant for, and perhaps overreliance on, classic luxuries like truffles and wagyu. About halfway through dinner, chef Samuel Clonts, late of Brooklyn Fare, steps behind the black walnut bar with enough osetra caviar to trade in for a Rolex. He takes a fat quenelle of roe, lies it atop a mound of vinegar-laced rice, wraps it in toasted nori, and hands it to you.',\n",

As you work down the roll, the roe becomes softer and oilier, the crisp nori and warm rice intensifying the briny notes. ',\n",
       "  'The key here is balance. So many caviars can assault the palate with salt or fade into buttery nothingness. Clonts brilliantly chooses a variety that works well mid-meal. This is all the more impressive since the preparation contains a whopping 25-30 grams of roe, a portion that could easily command $150 as an individual dish. Here it comes part of a $200, service-included, twelve-course tasting. ',\n",
       "  'If only the rest of the feast were as compelling.',\n",
       "  'Uchu, located just a block and a half south of Houston on a quiet stretch of Eldridge, houses two separate venues, serving two different menus. Operators generally employ these spilt-style restaurants to maximize accessibility. Danny Meyer perfected this style at The Modern and Gramercy Tavern, placing a more casual, a la carte room next to a fancier, set menu space. But at oligarch-inclined Uchu, the eight-seat kaiseki room actually is the more affordable spot. The front room features $300 tastings by Eiji Ichimura, a chef famous for stacking multiple slices of fatty toro on top of one another in a single piece of nigiri. ',\n",

Assessing the technical nuances of high-end sushi spots, which largely serve similar products, can at times feel like comparing two $500 bottles of Burgundy; maybe one’s objectively better or maybe it’s just a matter of preference, but either way it’s a task that serves a narrower audience.

       "  'Then the food starts appearing from the kitchen, which is odd because the point of sitting at a counter is to get a peek at the creative and technical process of cooking, watching as chefs contemplate micro-garnishes and turn hamachi fillets into translucent, abstract artwork through impossible knife work. At Uchu, caviar rolling and truffle shavings notwithstanding, diners spend most of the meal looking at a handsome brown wall of whisky bottles, and watching a guy behind the bar make cocktails. He likes to use infuse his drinks with smoke, creating a slightly sweet haze that recalls a nightclub or your buddy who vapes too much. ',\n",
       "  'Clonts kicks off the meal with uni. Sometimes he places it in a glazed ceramic bowl above a layer of tofu and pumpkin — a study in soft textures from the land and sea.

       "  'Or instead of the prawn, Clonts might send out a few forgettable slices of fried sweetbread. Inconsistency is an issue here. ',\n",
       "  'And then there is the question of Uchu’s more traditional gourmet fare. In his Letters to a Young Chef, Daniel Boulud wrote that “clientele and imagination determine what ingredients you should buy...It does not all have to be truffles, caviar, and foie gras.” His comment was prescient in that it preceded a decade-plus movement of young chefs redefining and expanding the notion of luxury as we know it, from the faux-shark’s fin soup of Benu, to the lemongrass-flavored ants of Noma, to the green apple taffy helium balloons of Alinea, to the house-made mozzarella of Torrisi.

It’s perfect, until you try it another night and the eggs are overcooked and lack their compelling richness.',\n",

Here, the bread completely overwhelms the fattiness and seasonings of the beef. It tastes like any steak sandwich. Rice laced with foie gras, the final savory course, has little of the duck liver’s signature richness; the ingredient is more oily than flavorful.

       "  'The original Szechuan Mountain House was one among a raft of modern and more expensive Sichuan restaurants to hit Flushing during the last three years. Eschewing the bursts of red and communal tables of their predecessors, these places flaunted stylish interiors with intimate seating. Some featured rustic elements meant to evoke Chinese villages; others were more East Village-y, with exposed concrete surfaces, deejays, and futuristic light fixtures.',\n",
       "  'Opening on an interior courtyard of a new shopping and hotel complex off Prince Street, Szechuan Mountain House was an instant hit among well-heeled dating couples out for an evening of innovative food in a romantic atmosphere. More recently, a branch daringly opened on St. Marks in the East Village. It grabbed the second-floor space formerly occupied by Grand Sichuan, itself an early advocate of the Sichuan peppercorns that have become ubiquitous in the neighborhood.',\n",
       "  'A stone-clad koi pond and burbling waterfall confronts you upon entering the space. Enclosed bamboo booths trail off into an interior decorated with pottery and other elements, intended to evoke the eponymous mountain retreat. But far from mounting a menu obsessed with the rural or even the urban food of Sichuan, the bill of fare is an eclectic document. In addition to Sichuan standards and Sichuan-themed inventions, it borrows dishes from other regions, leaping from Hunan to Dongbei to Beijing to Hong Kong.',\n",
       "  'Part of the appeal of both Mountain Houses is dramatic platings. Take the first item on a menu: sliced pork belly with chile garlic sauce ($10.95). Looking like thin slices of pale bacon, poached pork belly hangs over a dowel like laundry on a line, interspersed with slices of shaved cucumber. Underneath, a receptacle of chile oil with a wad of mashed garlic is destined for dipping. The contrast of the raw garlic’s pungency and the pork belly’s blandness proves unforgettable, and there’s no better dish for audience participation in town.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes this awesome creativity runs off the rails, though. Less successful is “grilled beef ribs with steamed bun” ($21.95). In actuality, the ribs should be singular and the bun plural, since the dish consists of a single humongous beef rib, somewhat resembling the sort found at the city’s Texas barbecues. Alongside are the kind of folded, steamed bao you now see in nearly every Asian fast food spot. The meat has been cut from the bone, and it’s tough and gristly from being roasted too fast and too hot, which is why the same rib is cooked “low and slow” in barbecues.',\n",
       "  'Also on the novel side are round shrimp fritters sided with sliced spuds, like pink ping pong balls with paddles; and planks of mung bean starch in chile oil and Sichuan peppercorns that wiggle and wobble in a glistening array. There are Sichuan standards, too, including twice-cooked pork, kung pao shrimp, and a ma po tofu ($10.95) that manages to taste better than any other with its silky tofu, earthy fermented bean paste, and daring oiliness. When it wants to, Mountain Szechuan can serve straight-up Sichuan, and it doesn’t stint on the peppercorns.',\n",
       "  'Some Sichuan dishes are charmingly amplified. Peanuts are introduced to the usual ox tongue and tripe in chile oil, adding crunch to the slipperiness. And the full complement of organs and other varieties meats is in full force. Indeed, Szechuan Mountain House should receive plaudits for offering pig intestines and kidneys, fish maws, curdled blood, and the notably-named “strapping cattle throat” ($10.95) — rubbery white strips of integument that’s popular in Chongqing, a major municipality in southwest China. ',\n",
       "  'Perhaps in adherence to the current proclivity for eating lots of vegetables, Szechuan Mountain House has some of the most interesting vegetarian dishes in the city, scattered throughout the menu and not just in the section called “Vegetable.” A brilliant bowl of yellow corn kernels come individually coated with duck egg yolk, giving them a unique texture and making them taste cornier than buttery theater popcorn. The signature fried rice is ramified with mustard greens, while a dish of fried lotus roots and celery provides a spectacular snap that you can hear as diners around the table attack it, with a subtle flavor that you’ll dream of that evening.',\n",
       "  'But the most exciting aspect of Szechuan Mountain House lies in the fact that the daring menu hasn’t been made blander for a perceived East Village audience, mirroring the sorts of experimentation and quest for novelty seen heretofore mainly in the new Sichuan restaurants in Flushing — and presumably, in China itself.',\n",

The heat transforms chicken hearts into springy, snappy saltiness, with little sinew or offally tang.

The color is tan. The texture is denser than gelato. And the flavor is a dead ringer for foie gras. I asked the waiter whether there’s liver in the dessert. She shook her head. I continued eating, slowly, and then furiously.',\n",
       "  'The duo of yeasts imparts the product with a subtle minerality. And the huckleberry, laced with a whisper of verjus, kicks in the requisite sugars and acidity to keep everything balanced. The recipe is simple, almost mundane, but the alchemy that occurs somewhere in between emulsification and defrosting results in a transformation one might more closely associate with a Hogwarts spell than an act of normal gastronomy.

It is not the combined effort of a culinary team with a deep background in avant-garde flavor combinations. The dish is a simple act of experimentation. Claire Welle, who creates the pastries, says she chose yeast as a flavoring agent because she wanted to “explore ingredients used for function and see if they could operate as flavor.”',\n",
       "  'Here it’s worth noting that Welle is essentially the head baker, as well as the executive chef, butcher, fromagere — she makes her own Hungarian liptauer — dishwasher, and occasional server.

She refers to herself as a “dirty line cook.” Her business partner, Samantha Safer, balances the books and bartends most nights. ',\n",

They also promote, by virtue of their crowds, the notion that residential areas are teeming with diners who crave culinary creativity.',\n",

Of course, one shouldn’t overlook the toasted miche that comes with the silky foie gras torchon; the chefs slick it with enough rendered duck fat to impart it with the unmistakable tang of dry-aged game. And since we’re being comprehensive, Welle, during brunch, also serves brioche with chocolate, dill biscuits, financiers, squash miso quick bread, coffee cakes, sticky maple buns, and an olive loaf.

It is an improvement on 99 percent of the lobster rolls hawked in this town, and it costs just $13. ',\n",

Like a dry Amontillado sherry, the caramel color belies a lean, sharp flavor. The little gobs exude an earthiness so profound they recall the meatiness of a vegetarian chili. ',\n",
       "  'Braised onions might not be the central reason this tiny spot commands a two hour wait on Fridays. But their grandeur certainly suggest what chef Rita Sodi can do with very little.',\n",
       "  'Sodi, a fashion industry vet who was raised on a farm north of Florence, opened her namesake restaurant in 2008. She had no formal training as a chef. I thought her best dish, in the earliest days, was the negroni.',\n",
       "  'The venue quickly cultivated a loyal neighborhood following, and I heard the food improved over the years, though Sodi didn’t receive a serious level of critical attention until 2014, when she opened the excellent Via Carota nearby, a larger, more boisterous, pan-regional, Italian spot with chef Jody Williams.',\n",
       "  'The two chefs have morphed into bona fide (but small time) empire builders; they’ll soon open Pisellino, a small cafe that will sell cute little tramezzini. But before the media coverage over that spot starts to build, it’s worth throwing the following into the mix: I Sodi, quieter and more compact than Via Carota, has transformed itself into one of the city’s finest Italian spots, a love letter to Tuscany whose pure product obsessions can make it feel as focused as some of the wildly expensive sushi spots popping up around town. ',\n",
       "  'The room, in January, smells heavily of the black truffles that are native to Sodi’s homeland. She lets them rain over pappardelle for $39 (compared with $65 at Babbo). And she shaves them over grilled sourdough slicked with honey and draped in lard, the sweet fat just warm enough to release the mossy overtones of the fungi. A cynic would dismiss this as found food, as an easily assembled luxury; I’d respectfully counter that Sodi’s brilliance is taking this trinity of powerful Tuscan flavors — charcuterie, bread, and truffles — and forging a precarious balance among them through the primitive power of fire.',\n",
       "  'Sodi, who’s sometimes overly humble about the power of her own cooking, would likely scoff at that description. “It’s just food. It’s just enjoyable food,” she told The New York Times in 2014. “That’s it. You put it on the table, you talk and you eat.” ',\n",
       "  'There is, at first glance, a certain incongruity about the cooking of Tuscany, an expression of bountiful produce and game meats. There’s something paradoxical about how the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, how the home of poets like Dante and polymaths like Da Vinci, how the land of the breathtakingly complex Brunello di Montalcino, a wine that can age for half a century or more, is also where the cooking somewhat fastidiously leans toward the simple and straightforward. But it doesn’t take long to realize that the cooking is far from simplistic. ',\n",

       "  'I mention this because in an era when phrases like “rustic” and “comfort” in New York restaurants can feel like a code for safe and boring, and in an era where Italian fare of any variety can feel more like a “sure thing” business decision than a culinary one, it would be easy to look at I Sodi’s menu and write it off as plain or pandering. Look, another appetizer of grilled vegetables. ',\n",
       "  'Well, try those vegetables, especially if they’re porcinis. Sodi gently burnishes the fungi, leaving the caps soft and squishy, while the stalks remain firmer. Some bites burst with a straightforward nuttiness. Others begin a touch watery, then echo faintly of wood and pine. I thought about these complexities over I Sodi’s giant plate of porcini, for which I paid $23. And then I thought about a one-note version I sampled at a Japanese spot where dinner ran $500 for two. ',\n",
       "  'Sodi fries her artichoke hearts without batter; she serves them with neither aioli for dipping nor lemon for squeezing. A waiter simply places a white bowl of salted hearts on the bartop, and you eat them as if they were unevenly cut potato chips, crispy and copper-colored at the edges, plump and soft near the fatter side.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant’s recipe for steak tartare doesn’t contain cheddar or sunchokes like the more experimental versions at Wildair or Estela. And yet the flavor is as revelatory as any of its modern analogues; the cool meat, hand chopped just larger than risotto grains, shimmers in its dressing of anchovy oil. Raw onions lend a whisper of sweetness at first, and then a delicate irony funk lingers — until a forkful of arugula washes the palate clean. If there’s a better traditional tartare in the city, I don’t know of it.',\n",
       "  'I Sodi is small. It’s a single room of a restaurant, accessible just behind a barn house-style sliding wood door; the only thing that doesn’t feel genuinely Italian is a Dyson space heater in the foyer. There are three tables up front, five along the wall, a sixteen seat marble bar opposite them, and and airplane-style aisle in between; a beverage cart passing through would surely elicit bumps and bruises. And yet somehow the entire space has always felt comfortable. Perhaps it’s the leather-softened bar stools. Perhaps it’s the sound-absorbing tablecloths. Perhaps it’s even that sliding doors, which is so silent that new patrons don’t seem to physically enter as conjure themselves.',\n",
       "  'The closest thing to an art installation is the rack of amari and digestivi that stretches half the length of the bar. You might need one or two during the meal — a shot of rose-scented Montenegro, a dose of rhubarb-laced Sibona — as pastas are portioned like mains while the actual mains can easily feed two. That’s not a bad deal considering that virtually every pasta, save truffles or the lasagna, tops out at $21. ',\n",
       "  'That caramelized onion masterpiece is the right move for a shared mid-course. So is cacio e pepe, a preparation whose ubiquity seems to be approaching hamburger levels in pasta-focused restaurants. I Sodi’s stands out from the crowd by using a snappy dried spaghetti over the softer tonnarelli used elsewhere — and by using a strong dose of pepper, letting the sting of the capscium act as a proper counterweight to the rich pecorino.

A better call is the giant, obscenely juicy cornish hen roast under a brick, or the slowly-braised wagyu brisket, a soft mound of concentrated beefiness over a smear of buckwheat polenta. Sodi cooks the grains in nothing but water — there’s no butter or cream — ensuring that the starch, normally a digestive evening ender, acts a light and nimble foil to the beef.',\n",

All the more reason for another shot of Montenegro. Or Ramazzotti. Or Branca Menta. It’s all enough to make you realize that Sodi, along with Williams, have essentially, and perhaps unexpectedly, risen to the top of New York’s downtown Italian scene.',\n",

Every luxe empire has a signature amenity, something patrons enjoy for a few seconds and then forget about. At L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, one of the world’s most expensive restaurant chains, that amenity is mashed potatoes. Guests at the new Manhattan outpost receive a small, rich pot of pommes puree during the final savory course. Fan-like indentations decorate the top layer, a deft act of latte art for potatoes.',\n",
       "  'The freebie seems generous in an age when a side of steakhouse potatoes can command a steep price, but keep in mind the cheapest steak here is a 6-ounce American cut that costs $95, service included.',\n",
       "  'Waiters announce two things upon presenting the pommes. First, they identify the product as “Joël Robuchon’s” potatoes, in case anyone suspects that the “chef of the century” outsourced the recipe for a mere side dish. Second, they claim that the potatoes themselves are “famous.” This is true. In 1980s Paris, the indulgent spuds helped Robuchon make a name for himself at his now-closed Jamin. The impossible ratio of butter to fingerlings, as well the fact that Robuchon was serving such a humble dish at an ambitious venue, epitomized the chef’s efforts to counter France’s lighter, brighter, yet somewhat affected nouvelle cuisine. ',\n",
       "  'The dish does not live up to its legendary status, at least not here in New York. Vigorous whisking imparts the potatoes with the texture of silk, but the dairy fats, which cool quickly, stiffen up to the density of a leaden paste. The potatoes do not taste of the earthy starch any more than they taste of good butter. They almost taste of nothing. And so through the power of manipulation, such an integral part of fine dining, Robuchon’s cooks have taken two of the world’s great ingredients and turned them into haute Crisco.',\n",
       "  'Once upon a time, before the Robuchon Incorporated assembly line manufactured foie gras-stuffed quail at a dozen spin-offs across the world, L’Atelier was a relevant New York restaurant.',\n",
       "  'The original Manhattan location opened in 2006, a few years after Robuchon shook some of the stodginess out of Parisian fine dining with Japanese-style counter service and Spanish-style small plates. The Big Apple L’Atelier was a key player in our city’s own culinary tie loosening; the chef’s tapas-focused menu ensured well-heeled walk-ins could dispense with large sums of cash on visually stunning small plates almost as quickly as on a pair of Manolos. It closed in 2012. ',\n",
       "  'Nearly half a decade later, L’Atelier is back, this time in a cool corner of West Chelsea. It is not a relevant New York restaurant. As countless small plates places put out ambitious fare that’s not just creative but rationally priced as well, L’Atelier has devolved into a mediocre bacchanalia for the rich.',\n",
       "  'It feels like 2006 all over again. The Champagne-by-the-glass list is Veuve Clicquot-only. The color scheme is classic L’Atelier: jet-black stools contrasted against crimson leather cushions and a shiny rosewood counter. The room is decorated with green apples in glass bowls, chile peppers in jars, and dried spaghetti in black vases, a design ethos that recalls the Getty Images stock food photography archive. The soundtrack is international hotel lobby bossa nova.',\n",
       "  'The menu highlights dishes that could’ve been copied or adapted from Robuchon outposts in Taipei, Singapore, London, or quite frankly anywhere. A handful of black truffle shavings are paired with a salad of cold artichokes and foie gras ($75); the muted, obvious flavors feel ripped from the first-class cabin menu of a 1985 transatlantic flight to London. Wagyu beef, in turn, is subjected to the clubstaurant slider treatment of the aughts, two tiny, underseasoned, overcooked burgers (topped with foie gras) for $44.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen slathers steak tartare with so much mustard and Worcestershire that it imparts the tartare with the mouthfeel of a chunky pudding, drowning out the fattiness and flavors of the meat itself. This appetizer is nearly double the price of better versions at Estela or Wildair.',\n",

It symbolizes a city overrun by an affluent corporate monoculture, from boutique spin classes that charge thousands for yearly memberships to fast-casual salad chains that don’t take cash to sushi chains where a $200 starting price almost seems like a break.

Patrons occasionally show up in red carpet-style blowouts, perfectly tailored suits, and backless dresses. “This goes great on granola and yogurt in the morning,” a Russian speaker next to me says of the 1983 Chateau D’Yquem she’s drinking, a heck of a breakfast condiment at $1,150 by the bottle. Her companion orders a shot of Macallan M whisky, which runs $750. I’m sure it was great.',\n",

A snack-sized portion of saffron risotto, with little saffron flavor or any type of compelling fat to soften the grit of the undercooked rice, runs $38. A green curry sauce is brilliantly aromatic; the three scallops that sit in it recall the flavor of styrofoam.',\n",

       " ['My early associations with the Alembic, when it opened a dozen years ago, was that it was a moody, dark place for cocktails, really good cocktails, craft cocktails, which had yet to sweep the city. The food was there to keep the cocktails company, but not something to seek out on its own. Which is why when I heard that in her first year as Alembic’s chef, Rachel Aronow was nominated for a James Beard Rising Star award, I was intrigued. Excited, even. The best thing I’d ever eaten on Haight Street was a Ben & Jerry’s waffle cone. ',\n",
       "  'And now, despite a menu with more downs than ups, the best thing I’ve eaten on Haight Street is Alembic’s fall squash veloute. It’s a fancy word for a thick, velvety sauce, in this case, butternut blended with spices and vegetable stock poured over foamy dollops of Stilton blue cheese and a scattering of squash seeds and cayenne-spiked sunflower seeds that gave each soothing spoonful a surprising crunch. It was a soup fit for birds — and I liked it.',\n",
       "  'I also liked the Brussels sprouts, whole young bulbs from Half Moon Bay in a maple-aji Amarillo glaze roasted to an addictive chewy-crisp. A simple ceramic slab of wide, slippery ribbons of pappardelle in a hearty lamb ragu was a welcome addition to the otherwise in-your-face fussy entrees. The scallops were lightly seared and profoundly buttery, but plated with foam and flowers and more embellishment than necessary — as were most dishes at the Alembic. ',\n",

       "  'Eating was actually a strong word. It was more like picking at. Pushing the tea-smoked roulade around the plate like apathetic teenagers, hoping if, perhaps, we found the right bite, it would taste better. Unfortunately, we didn’t. The rabbit meat was fleshy, almost translucent pink, to the point that we repeatedly wondered aloud if it was cooked. Oozing with an unrecognizable mixture of pork belly and foie gras, it was a barely edible bundle, and a most unattractive one — encased in a drab gray pistachio dukkah-rubbed crust that, even for this ardent carnivore, too closely resembled the color of rabbit fur. It didn’t help that the accompanying supposedly roasted sunchokes were as hard as a potato just dug from the field. ',\n",

A title that comes with certain expectations: that they be bite-size, yes, but also golden and hot and crisp. The rosy-orangey hue would’ve worked too, had this starter not been the antithesis of all things tot: that is, lukewarm and mushy, and pushed against a mound of pistachio aioli that didn’t add much. “Pigs in a Blanket” is another beloved app that arrived bastardized. A more apt name would have been Hog in a Log — it was a foot-long, panko-fried fatty, stuffed with slow-braised tail, topped with a frizzy toupee of sprouts that didn’t have enough flavor to warrant eating more than a bite or two. Even our party of five left half of the heft on the plate. The Spanish octopus was a tightly wound rubbery mound of tentacles; tucked with pretty romanesco and pink petals and surrounded by verde gel polka dots, it looked like an octopus dolled up for prom.

       "  'The distinctive food of Rome is enjoying its moment in the moonlight, as a fit successor to our earlier obsessions with Tuscany and Naples. Like Naples, Rome is a pizza town, but unlike Naples, pizzas occur in a bewildering variety of styles. There are round cracker pizzas that can break apart as you bite into them; and thicker circular pies like those of Naples, but slightly crisper. Some pizzas resemble Sullivan Street Bakery’s pizza bianca, oily and bumpy without sauce, sometimes used to make mortadella sandwiches; others are the bready focaccia squares found in bakeries, strewn with zucchini blossoms, onions, or other single ingredients.',\n",
       "  'But one of the most characteristic styles is the pinsa. Some would say it’s not really a pizza, but an oblong flop of dough rounded at either end like a huarache, perhaps originating in ancient Rome as pizza’s ancestor. The dough is different too, a mixture of grains that cooks up light and airy. To compensate for this lack of weight, the toppings are piled on with a freer hand, including unexpected meats and vegetables. Even in New York, where we’re proud of our wild and crazy pies, the pinsa seems unbound by convention.',\n",
       "  'The stated purpose of Prospect Lefferts Gardens newcomer Camillo — named after Count Camillo Negroni, the inventor of the negroni — is turning out pinsas from owner-chef Michele Baldacci, a Florence native who’s also behind Locanda Vini e Olii in Clinton Hill. As a result of the restaurant’s name, Camillo’s supporting liquor program is heavy on the negronis ($10). While the normal formula of this strong swizzle involves gin and Campari, one the nine available here is contrarily made with mezcal, while another features artichoke liqueur, perhaps causing the count to spin in his grave.',\n",
       "  'The bar dominates the front of the restaurant, and its white marble expanse is the best place to dine. The dining room seats around 50 and is defined by old fashioned hanging lamps, beveled mirrors, and a ceiling that looks like the well-worn deck of a clipper ship. It makes you a bit dizzy staring up at it.',\n",
       "  'The pinsas are spectacular. Five depend on tomato sauce, while three others luxuriate in their white cheesiness. But the difficult choice this represents can be avoided: Divided down the middle, a ninth pinsa, the Romana ($15), mixes both types. On one side is a tomatoey Amatriciana sauce from the town of Amatrice in the Apennine Mountains about two hours outside of Rome, featuring funky hog jowl. The other side is spread with cacio e pepe, the peppery Pecorino sauce, another specialty of the Eternal City.',\n",
       "  'Turning pastas into pinsas is a magical idea, also seen in New York City’s ziti and lasagna pies. Other pinsas at Camillo are equally startling. My favorite is the capricciosa ($19), a wild ride of heaped-up tomatoes, olives, artichokes, mushrooms, and prosciutto cotto (baked ham). It’s like a lush open-face sandwich you might take on a picnic. Another pinsa features the very southern Italian pairing of pork sausage and broccoli rabe, and there’s also a fine vegetarian pie topped with eggplant, two types of summer squash, and oodles of onions.',\n",
       "  'If pinsas alone were the province of the restaurant, it would be a fine thing. But Camillo seeks to be a full-blown Italian restaurant, too, dotting its menu with dishes associated with Rome, as well as other quirky regional cooking from around the country. From the Roman stockyards comes coda alla vaccinara ($15), a dense ragu of boneless oxtail that dukes it out in the bowl with thick, wide, fresh pappardelle. Equally splendid are two lamb-stuffed cannelloni smothered in béchamel like mutant enchiladas.',\n",
       "  'The appetizers have shifted around quite a bit since the restaurant’s opening last September. I was particularly fond of cotechino, a cooked pork sausage that arrived on a bed of lentils, the way it’s done in Bologna. It’s a dish usually served around New Year’s and has since disappeared from the menu, though the team says it will return next December. Meanwhile, the bowl of baby octopi awash in gritty red sauce that I didn’t much like — disappointing if you crave charred tentacles — still lingers. The best current app is anchovies on buttered toast ($8), in which dairy and carbs mellow the salty and stinky fish. Even if you don’t normally order anchovies, you’ll like these.',\n",
       "  'There are always at least three piatti, which should each be shared by at least two diners. The fritto misto ($17) is here interpreted in an all-veggie fashion, and comes hot and greasy on top of a sheet of brown paper. Exercise the chicken option ($3 more) to add an extra highlight to the perfectly fried zucchini, onions, artichokes, and cauliflower. Even better is a big hunk of roast goat in gravy, served on one occasion with cubed potatoes and on another with braised chicory.',\n",
       "  'After eating pinsas, apps, pastas, and the voluminous main courses, maybe you’re not ready for dessert.

       "  'Inside, the tables are small and matched, wooden and well-spaced. A bar provides padded stools; plain white globes hanging from the ceiling furnish illumination. In all its plainness, is this yet another French-Canadian bistro of the type we saw at M. Wells and Fedora a few years ago? Well, partly, and the first time I sat down in August, when the place was already four months old, flagons of maple syrup lined the kitchen. Indeed, Chez Ma Tante is named after a Montreal french fry and hot dog stand. But in other ways, the restaurant is very much a unique place.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant is the work of two Cafe Altro Paradiso alums, Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber, and the menu reflects some of the old Estela zaniness. In its emphasis on organ meat pates and terrines, it’s also reminiscent of Montreal’s Au Pied de Cochon. O’Neal once toiled at M. Wells Dinette in P.S. One, and that experience undoubtedly provided further inspiration. The chicken liver pate ($9) might be at home on any bistro menu in town, artfully smeared across the plate and accompanied by grilled toasts and pickled chiles.',\n",
       "  'Other dishes are on another level, offal-wise, particularly with the pig head terrine. This patchwork comes in helter skelter slices, composed of ragged chunks of sinew, fat, and deeply red swatches of meat. It’s about the richest thing you’ve ever tasted and might remind you of the work of U.K. chef Fergus Henderson. I loved it, even though it came with the same toasts and chiles as the chicken liver pate. (The head cheese is currently off the menu, but the waitress assured me it would return: “The chef just didn’t have access to a pig head this week,” she confided.) ',\n",
       "  'Apps from both the snacks and starters sections of the menu are more prosaic, but each offers its own playful twists on familiar recipes. Bright red with radicchio, Caesar salad ($13) comes in lemon dressing so light that it might have been painted on with a brush. Delicate potato chips surmount steak tartare — useless for scooping, but useful for crunch. But it’s the few drops of fish sauce that make this tartare memorable. ',\n",
       "  'The best appetizer, next to the head cheese, is stracciatella ($15), a molten dairy product in the burrata family that comes sluiced with chile oil, wadded with wilted greens, and further kicked in the pants with anchovies. This spectacular bread dip — intensely creamy and briny — could be your entire meal. While there’s no poutine on the menu, the city’s best steak fries are found here, a sublime shade of sun-kissed brown and served with aioli, very much in the Montreal mode. Less Canadian is an oyster service, each $3 bivalve littered with parsley and accentuated with a splash of sauvignon blanc. Think of it as a small collection of raw-oyster salads.',\n",

Fish also makes an appearance in kedgeree, an Anglo-Indian dish that was rendered in yawn-worthy fashion when I first tasted it, too bland by a kilometer. But when I re-experienced it recently, it was much more aggressively seasoned. Hallelujah!',\n",

George Chen is the brains behind Union Street’s 1990s trailblazing Betelnut, four restaurants in Shanghai, and in March, ChinaLive, the $20 million Eataly of dim sum downstairs. And now he was opening his “home” — or an opulent stage set of it — to the .5 percent, si fang cai-style. Or “private chateau cuisine,” as Chen puts it, a lavish, 10-course feast that takes entertaining tips from 17th-century China.',\n",

       "  'After several minutes of awkward silence, the fellow diner spoke: “I’ve never been to a restaurant like this,” he said. ',\n",
       "  'Me neither. Because of the price and pomp, some might consider it the French Laundry with chopsticks; a Qing Dynasty-style Quince; a less-austere Benu. But, really, Eight Tables is unlike any restaurant this side of the Pacific — and exactly what chef Chen intended it to be: dinner at his place. The elegant, tan-hued, multi-room maze was regal but warm, with white embossed wallpaper fashioned from antique wedding dress patterns, cushy leather banquettes, and circular, semi-private tables that were comically large for two. ',\n",
       "  'It also includes a full (and appropriately pedigreed) staff: Anthony Keels, a genius bartender who defected from Saison, along with GM Andrew Fuentes; Tony Kim, a sociable sommelier who came from the Clift; and a mannerly server named Huntly, who genuinely thanked us for asking his name. “People rarely do,” he lamented. Then snapped his fingers. “It’s just, ‘deliver my drinks, serve my food.’” ',\n",
       "  'Which he did, flawlessly. He was aided by a fleet of mostly men wearing light-beige three-piece Ralph Lauren suits with a rainbow of patterned Hermès ties, who collectively looked like groomsmen at a WASPy summer wedding — and Chen, who came around to each table like the proud father, to introduce each course. (Chen was also wearing jeans, by the way, and a stained chef’s coat, looking a little schlubbier than a fine dining chef parading through his dining room usually does. I found it refreshing.) ',\n",

       "  'The first course was a grid of mini multicolored porcelain bowls containing the “nine essential flavors” of Chinese cuisine. These bite-sized beauties tasted even better than they looked: sweet, a jujube date bursting with chrysanthemum honey; salty, sous-vide chicken coiled with cured duck-egg yolk; smoky, dark soy-marinated smelt wok-fried then smoked; numbing, paper-thin slices of beef tendon simmered in red and green Sichuan peppercorns that left my lips tingling until the next course.

A supplemental course referred to as “beef and broccoli,” for instance, was anything but the gloppy go-to take-out order. Rather, bright-green baby bulbs of tender Gailan hearts were plated sparingly with Miyasaki A5 wagyu, marbled hunks the color of cooked rhubarb and the texture of softened butter — and worth every one of its 6,000 pennies. (Although, on another night, it was a less transcendent experience.)',\n",
       "  'Barbecue “shao kao” became a trio that included sweet, smoky strips of Iberico char siu with a kumquat glaze; a crisp deconstructed Cantonese-style pork-belly sandwich about half the size of a Kit Kat, with more crunch; and a crackling Peking duck skin topped with Kaluga caviar teetering over a piece of feather-light shrimp toast — maybe my favorite bite of the night, save for the mushy fish eggs (which were farmed in the Hubei province of China, and not yet quite up to snuff. Still, Chen explained, he wanted to support their efforts).',\n",

In a place that aims for perfection, the slightest imperfection — and inconsistencies — stands out. The velvet chicken, too, suffered a similar fate. Tender breast poached in shallot oil and enmeshed in slippery, snow-white egg whites and matsutake mushrooms came blanketed in Burgundy truffles, and yet, it was a bit bland. A kind of comfort food dish I’d be happy to eat elsewhere; here it was the faintest of them all.',\n",

The Lily Pond: a palm-sized bowl of Martin Miller’s gin and floating nasturtium, mixed with “forest water” — cucumber juice, sorrel, and red shiso, spun in a centrifuge — prepared tableside, with tweezers and a flourish of liquid nitrogen, making the cocktail the new bananas Foster. Meanwhile, my friend, who rarely drinks, and declined the pairing, was loving, and feeling, his Thai Iced Tea Milk Punch, a white rum-based wonder that was smooth and subtle and creamy, like a real Thai iced tea, made with half-and-half yet magically clear.',\n",

The first was a bracing chrysanthemum granita with plum preserve, and the second was what pastry chef Luis Villavelazquez dubbed “Chinese sea grass”: passion-fruit mousse capped with pickled sea beans and crinkled seagrass rice crackers and frothing with translucent, mesquite-infused bubbles that reminded me of the time I accidentally put dish soap instead of detergent in the dishwasher. It was more spectacle than satisfying, but — and perhaps this was the point — an unforgettable finale. ',\n",
       "  'Did we really need any of it? Of course not. A dinner like this is all about indulgence.  ',\n",

       "  'What that means, I’m not quite sure. I never dined with 17th-century Qing dynasty nobles. Nor, for that matter, with 2017 Hong Kong elite. All I know is that after four hours hanging out with Anthony and Tony, Huntly and George, it felt a little like bidding farewell to new friends.

Then again, Public is a questionable name for Ian Schrager’s parent hotel; weekend rates generally start at $400 after taxes.

Prospective guests walk past a spacious yard, which is a nice place to relax under a real tree with fake leaves, past a series of Tron-themed escalators, past a gift shop hawking $600 sunglasses, and past a pastry counter that sells excellent (if slightly stale) strawberry eclairs. Those who continue to walk back will encounter the restaurant, guarded by a host who, on at least one occasion, knows to reflexively look down at his little host computer (not up to make eye contact) when a patron approaches.',\n",

Brown wood beams crisscrossed the ceiling, a handsome juxtaposition to the (plastic) ivy that hangs in the rear garden. I admired this elegant ballet before sitting down and realizing my right hand was gently sticking to the bottom of my chair, my fingers apparently coated in a veneer of someone else’s soy-ginger sauce.

Even Manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it’s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.',\n",

       "  'But first up was my favorite: the boquerones, five shimmering, silver-white slivers, their bellies plump, their tails intact, lined up like synchronized swimmers over a spicy pimenton-spiked pool of tomato-based Iberian sauce, so good I sopped up the rest with the bread from our “charcuteria” plate. (The sauce had far more flavor than the jamon serrano anyway.) Because it’s almost a custom to finger-point and rank small plates as you eat them, my second favorite, also in the anchovy department, was the chicories covered in slabs of Manchego and doused in a creamy, fishy bagna cauda dressing. I’d go back to Barvale for this six-buck salad and a glass of Txakolina alone. ',\n",
       "  'Overall, I liked the tapas frias better than the hot. The escabeche tasted 10 times better than it looked, as let’s be honest: hunks of eggplant peeled, brined, then marinated resemble banana slugs, especially when snuggled in a ramekin. Fiery, slippery, and flecked with chile flakes and crisp garlic, they were immediately devoured; over toasted bread, they were even better. The morcilla-stuffed piquillo peppers were sweet and hearty. Ironically, only the “to die for!” atun crudo disappointed: lifeless cubes of tuna with microgreens and kumquats in a mild romesco were not worth the additional $4. ',\n",
       "  'The hot tapas were a little more hot and cold, if you will. Vegetables, like the charred cauliflower and the sauteed winter greens with pine nuts and raisins, were satisfying, if standard, staples. On the fried front, the croquetas de jamon were crisp, piping hot, and velvety-smooth; but the salt cod bunuelos were so bland and airy they seemed to dissolve on my tongue, like Claritin RediTabs. ',\n",
       "  'And then there was the pulpo, in all its meaty, purple-hued, tentacled glory, scattered with green olives and slices of fingerling potato (one of which accidentally fell into my friend’s mostly drunk glass of wine, undetected in the dim light by everyone but our supreme server, who swooped it away and replaced it with a full potato-free glass, free of charge).',\n",
       "  'I tried the pulpo on all three visits: on one, it was perfectly tender, deserving of real-life likes, not just all 1,002 (and counting) on Bauer’s Instagram. On another, the poor octopus was literally boiled to death then nearly cremated in the pan, to the point of being more crispy than chewy. And one night it was so salty and so chewy, we stopped talking for what felt like a full minute as we watched each other work our molars harder than they may have ever been worked before. ',\n",
       "  'Ultimately, at most Spanish restaurants in America, it’s the paella that represents, that underscores its authenticity, embodying the overall experience. At Barvale, it did too, in a different sort of way. “At Barvale,” explained our server, “paella isn’t a big commitment. It’s just another dish, not the main star.” I appreciated that in theory. After waiting so long for a table, who really wants to wait another 45 minutes for a $40 pan that must be ordered by all? ',\n",
       "  'Our paella arrived with everything else, on a ceramic plate, not a sizzling platter, no bigger than a personal pizza, yet still easily shareable by three. (As, notably, most dishes were. These were hefty servings as far as tapas typically go. No battling for bites here!) The heaping pile of rice and mussels and whole shrimp and clams was crammed to one side, as if it had traveled in the trunk of a car up Lombard Street. Flanked by aioli and a wedge of grilled lemon, it was… well, what you’d expect from a $17 paella masterminded to fit the mood and menu prices of any Paganini restaurant. Like the others in his ever-expanding portfolio, Barvale, too, befits its bill. ',\n",
       "  'For a fun, affordable, night out, it’s worth the wait — for those who are willing. What I liked best about Barvale, though, as I discovered one Tuesday eve when I wasn’t: It’s made scoring a bar stool and a burger across Divisadero a little easier. ',\n",
       "  'What it costs: Easily less than $100 with a carafe of wine and plenty of tapas, before tax and tip.',\n",
       "  'What to drink: Those gin and tonics; a carafe of Txakolina. The rose-based sangria with ginger and blood orange isn’t bad as far as sangria goes, but still, it’s sweet—and beware the hangover.',\n",
       "  'What to eat: Anything that involves anchovies: the boquerones, the chicories with bagna cauda; esacbeche; squid mussels garbanzo salpicon; the pulpo—on a good pulpo night.',\n",

       "  'When chef Alex Raij opened El Quinto Pino in 2007, she served typical tapas — white anchovy fillets, salt cod fritters, and shrimp in garlic oil. She also offered atypical fare — a sea urchin panino.',\n",
       "  'The sandwich inspired an amusing game of critical one-upmanship. When Peter Meehan of the New York Times reviewed the Chelsea spot, he declared the oceanic panino the “sandwich of the year.” A few months later, blogger Andrea Strong wrote that the “unini,” as she called it, had taken on “legendary, if not mythical status.” Serious Eats then upgraded panino to “sandwich of the decade” in 2009, the same year the Frank Bruni cast a broader net, calling it an “era-defining treat.” ',\n",
       "  'They’re all impressive accolades for something that looked like an underbaked grilled cheese sandwich. The dish hailed from an era when restaurants didn’t calibrate visuals for social media; Instagram was still three years away and the iPhone had just debuted. ',\n",
       "  'Good news: The sandwich has not been beautified for the smartphone era. The only thing that’s changed is the urchin itself, which Raij says is higher quality. ',\n",
       "  'The pressed bread shatters when bitten. The squishy urchin bleeds neon juices. The sweet taste of uni fills your mouth — until mustard oil kicks in and stings the sinuses; that condiment doesn’t so much cleanse the palate as provide it a momentary reprieve from the funk of the sea. And while bigger restaurants — Toro and The Pool — would go on to serve uni sandwiches on toast with mustard, none have the approachable, iconic calling-card status that Raij’s does. ',\n",
       "  'The serving vessel was, and still is, wax paper. This is not uni as a luxury item, which it often is. This is uni as a sandwich, meant to be consumed while standing up, on the go. It is one of New York’s great dishes. ',\n",
       "  'As a certain strain of soul-draining monotony infects the New York dining landscape, with deep-pocketed empire builders and big-time chefs looking for The Next Big Thing, be it counter-service pasta, nouveau delivery, or quinoa-laced beet bowls, it’s refreshing that diners can still turn to a veteran, non-rock-star operator and find cuisine that’s simultaneously creative, thoughtful, and affordable. ',\n",
       "  'El Quinto Pino and sister spot Txikito around the block remain two of the most compelling expressions of Iberian fare in New York. The former has few equals in the sphere of tapas, while the latter might just be the city’s top Basque spot. Both fluently alternate between the traditional and the modern, between pan amb tomaca and double-patty burgers. And both do so without charging more than $30 for pretty much anything. ',\n",
       "  'Maybe we should all be paying less attention to new restaurants with full-time social-media coordinators or fast-casual ambitions, and more to venues that have been grinding it out for years without a place on the World’s 50 Best list. ',\n",
       "  'La Vara in Cobble Hill might be the Michelin-starred jewel of Raij’s tiny empire, which she runs with her co-chef and Bilbao-raised husband, Eder Montero, but that venue, an ode to the Sephardic and Moorish traditions of Spain, can command two-hour waits on a Saturday night. Neither El Quinto nor Txikito, by contrast, generate much of a queue for walk-ins. In fact both are so close to each other and the food comes out so expeditiously that one could literally hop between the two.',\n",
       "  'An ideal game plan: Kick off the festivities at El Quinto with cumin-spiced lamb skewers, follow up with chile- and anchovy-laced queso fundido, then scoot over to Txikito for ethereal salt cod fritters, with an interior blended to the texture of mousse and a heady flavor that evokes seafood chowder, and funky head-on shrimp.',\n",
       "  'Then return to Quinto for a frozen dark and stormy and rabbit paella where the yellow rice is a brilliant conveyance mechanism for the nuclear-powered aroma of saffron. ',\n",
       "  'One could continue eating. ',\n",
       "  'El Quinto began as a single tiny room. A larger dining area off to the side opened in 2013, but the heart of El Quinto is the bar room, with sconces the shape of antelope horns, wallside dining ledges as small as airline seat trays, burnished mirrors, chalkboard menus, and a curved marble counter — a classic design hack that lets solo patrons face other people instead of the bartender. ',\n",
       "  'The size of dishes are proportionate to the room. They are small, rarely more than a handful and a half of food. And they are often unexpectedly sweet, but never in an unwelcome fashion. ',\n",
       "  'Cantabrian anchovies lie on crackers adjacent to thin sticks of vanilla butter; just as the salt starts to overwhelm, the sugar-laced dairy wipes the palate clean like a milkshake. Bomba toledanas — spiced beef and potato fritters — come anointed with a thimble’s worth of habanero puree. The floral heat gently burns, until a mash of sweet peas, sitting below each croquette, cools the palate. And a pile of incendiary spreadable soppressata — essentially Spanish ’nduja — comes with a well of honey in the center, a classic Menorcan pairing that only seems foreign until you realize it’s the functional analogue to maple syrup-laced bacon.',\n",
       "  'Basque cuisine, at its heart, is a “cuisine of subtraction,” Raij writes in her cookbook, drawing contrast to the region’s more complex avant-gardists, from Arzak to Mugaritz. “Fancy embellishment is stripped away until you are left with the essence of an ingredient.”',\n",
       "  'And while El Quinto Pino is not a Basque restaurant — more about Txikito in a bit — her statement rings true. Or put differently: at El Quinto Pino, Raij and Montero use supporting flavors to deify a lead protein or vegetable. Their cooking evokes a superb three- or four-ingredient cocktail. Waiters don’t spend an hour describing the food upon presentation, because a spice or seasoning listed on the menu is apparent to the diner immediately upon consumption, without explanation or elaboration. ',\n",
       "  'For example: Shrimp fritters can verge into scallop-like sweetness in other hands. At Quinto, the kitchen uses brown krill to draw out the deeper, richer, mid-tide tang of XO sauce. And while Raij says she pairs plancha-singed calamari with garlic and Parmesan to evoke a pasta, the umami-rich ingredients end up producing a simpler and grander effect: They make squid taste more like squid. It is near-perfect food. ',\n",
       "  'Txikito is the slightly more creative restaurant, with certain refinements (no sandwiches, no burgers) and a somewhat heavier nod to seafood, in deference to the Basque love of all things maritime. ',\n",
       "  'Even the fries here, doused in paprika, arrive with a ramekin of cod-laced mayo. ',\n",
       "  'Like at Quinto, the cooks sear squid on the plancha, only they slice them into spaghetti-like ribbons and drape them over a puree of pine nuts with onions. They riff on txangurro, the traditional stuffed crab, by slicking the shellfish with cream cheese, warming it under the broiler, and lighting it ablaze with the very non-Basque sriracha; it packs as much crustacean flavor as a good crabcake yet it costs just $8.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen shreds skate wing with parsley coulis, fried garlic, dill, and cilantro, treating fish as if it is a salad ingredient meant to be tossed in a verdant and fragrant salad of herbs. It’s the type of dish one might expect at the two-Michelin-starred Aska.',\n",
       "  'Guests have more elbow room at Txikito. The bar is just a little bit longer. The wood-paneled walls don’t need windows to create the illusion of space. The garage-like front opens up during the spring, and sidewalk tables appear outside. It’s something to dream about until things get warmer. ',\n",
       "  'Until then, make do with the homemade Navarran sausage, a semi-firm “rope,” as the menu calls it, of pork jowl cut with paprika. The smoke of that spice is brilliantly restrained, recalling a charcoal grill’s dying embers.',\n",
       "  'Raij forges chewy little gnocchi out of shrimp and iberico; the pink surf-and-turf nuggets, tasting simultaneously of shellfish and aged ham, arrive in a delicate squid ink sauce. Ropa vieja, the Cuban dish of shredded steak with peppers, is de rigueur as well. Txikito substitutes brisket and stuffs it into green peppers, balancing the meatiness of the protein against the vegetal tang of the capsicum. Softening the richness further is a layer of yogurt and a whisper of non-traditional yuzu oil; Raij tells me that for most of the dishes, she provides the inspiration, while Montero, a native of Basque country, pushes back when necessary. ',\n",
       "  'Lemon cake, cut with orange-flower water, makes for a fine dessert. But it’s also hard not to resist dropping by El Quinto again for a sea urchin sandwich to go. During a year when so many new restaurants are soporific at best, spending all the more time at venues we’ve overlooked is a pleasant act of gastronomic protest.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Most tapas and sandwiches at $16 or under; many dishes under $10.',\n",

       "  'But the food scene… the food scene to the east is flourishing. It has been for a while, of course, as chefs ditch the city for cheaper rents, easier permits, a more laid-back crowd — and mostly for Oakland. Berkeley has fallen behind in the restaurant renaissance. So when a friend who knows her stuff texted me about a promising new spot that opened, in October, out in Albany of all places, I was intrigued. In part, I admit, because it was called Juanita & Maude (chef-owner Scott Eastman’s grandmother and mom, respectively). I’m a sucker for old-lady names.',\n",

And it dropped me right there, on the corner of San Pablo and Solano. A sleepy, suburbanesque strip where the only coffee shop was an old-school Royal Ground and the most fashionable restaurant nearby was Rivoli, which opened in, oh, 1994.',\n",

A place with locally sourced, lovingly made food, without wailing kids or anything remotely resembling pizza. They mean a place like Juanita & Maude — arguably the best thing to hit the North Berkeley area since… Whole Foods?',\n",
       "  'Fronted by large windows, the place was light if narrow, with walnut and warm lighting. It felt a little like an East Bay Frances (the Castro’s Michelin-starred spot, named after Melissa Perello’s grandmother). With elevated comfort food to match — and a neighborhood crowd that was more gray than gay. ',\n",
       "  'Coming from a Neverland like San Francisco, I appreciated it. I also valued the oh-so Berkeley vibe. Professorial men wrapped in plaid scarves, frumpy ladies draped in floral prints, a solo dude adorned in a bowtie, and multiple diners absorbed in musty library books. The food itself, though, was anything but: fresh, lively, current. ',\n",
       "  'The menu was more interesting than you’d expect from a quiet neighborhood place cooking “American cuisine.\" But as the website’s home page explains, this is chef Scott Eastman’s personal take on it — inspired by his varied culinary career cooking at Scandinavian, Japanese, and Italian restaurants. Now, at Juanita & Maude, he’s free to add a splash of Polish or German or French when he feels like it. As our server put it: “The chef felt stifled by the rules.” After almost a decade pulling pasta at Berkeley’s Corso, “he was ready to have some fun.”',\n",
       "  'Upon first glance, it seemed like maybe he was having a little too much fun, as the menu didn’t quite make sense. Did I really want massive rosemary-chile-marinated Castelvetrano olives with my hamachi crudo with my chanterelle and whipped chevre strudel? As it turned out, I did. Juanita & Maude was like a surprising 23 and Me result: a little bit of everything — and I was into it.',\n",
       "  'Even if I wasn’t into every dish. The New York steak tasted as firm and flavorless as a poorly cooked pork chop; its accompanying pommes frites were fine, albeit aching for salt. (At $34 dollars for three small slabs, it was also overpriced.) ',\n",
       "  'The quinoa, listed as simply Quinoa, was not much more than that: a seemingly bottomless bowl of bland. I like quinoa at home and, really, anywhere other than Eatsa, but it was a tad too soft, supposedly mixed with soy and pickled chile, as well as a few hunks of shiitake and sprigs of spigarello, but it needed more of all of it. On another night, though, they dubbed the quinoa dish donburi, and it was fiery and flavorful, with shiitake and sesame, citrus and soy vinaigrette. That was a quinoa I could get behind.',\n",
       "  'But the gnocchi I’d put on a pedestal. I say this as someone who has long ranked gnocchi toward the bottom of her pasta preferences (but above bowtie). Pillowy, potato-y, and perfect, it came touched in a creamy tomato sauce with a splash of sambuca one night, as cacio e pepe on another. Of everything I ate over three nights, it was this simple Parmesan, pepper, and pecorino dish I’m still thinking about. ',\n",
       "  'Actually, the fleshy Hamachi crudo flanked by a mound of superfresh avocado mash is still floating around my mind, too. As is that flaky, savory, phyllo strudel and a dreamy duck sausage with a butter bean ragout. Not to mention my dessert: a chocolate mousse, so 2009 I could barely stand to order it, but I’m glad I did. Buried with cocoa nibs and house-made graham cracker; topped with a sticky, honey-cinnamon meringue; and served up, like an Irish coffee from Buena Vista Cafe, it made chocolate mousse new again.

       "  'One of the most insightful messages in The French Laundry Cookbook, a classic tome that has inspired and frustrated scores with painstaking elevations of American cuisine, is that something as simple as pomme purees — humble mashed potatoes — can be strikingly complicated. In fact, it might be “the most difficult recipe here,” the authors wrote, “because there are so many small choices that make a big impact.”',\n",
       "  'It’s a lesson worth recalling at Reynard in Williamsburg’s Wythe Hotel, in case anyone’s inclined to dismiss the pumpkin puree — humble mashed squash — as yet another plate of marked-up Thanksgiving nostalgia. ',\n",
       "  'Christina Lecki, who joined as head chef this summer after leading April Bloomfield’s Michelin-starred kitchen at The Breslin for years, makes a bevy of infinitely small choices that add up to big flavor. This is true of all her fire-kissed American cuisine, the product of a wood-burning hearth in the kitchen, but it is especially true of her shockingly complex pumpkin.',\n",
       "  'Lecki uses the dying embers at the end of service to slowly roast her pumpkins overnight. The next day, she purees the collapsed gourds; cooks them down with chicken stock and onions; fortifies them with buttermilk; laces them with chile, cinnamon, and nutmeg; passes them through a chinois for silkiness; ladles them into a small brown wooden bowl; and finishes them with a pat of kefir butter.',\n",
       "  'The pumpkin accompanies a half chicken that’s been smoked and roasted, which is great in its own right, but believe me when I say that bird is just a supporting player. The puree takes on the color of rust and sports the texture of ice cream. The flavors range from vegetal to sweet to gently tangy (from the kefir), with lingering notes of Christmas spices. And unlike a fancy French pommes puree, or an overindulgent polenta, the butter here is used with restraint; it never detracts from the essence of the pumpkin. ',\n",
       "  'It is best consumed on a cold day, watching the neon of Wythe Avenue light up the falling snow. Add a touch of the chicken’s vinegar- and offal-laced gravy for extra oomph, and take pleasure in consuming one of New York’s next great dishes. ',\n",
       "  'Since it opened nearly six years ago, Reynard’s identity hasn’t so much centered around the food or the chef as it has around the urban ethos of its operator, Andrew Tarlow. The hospitality guru rose to fame at his restaurants Diner and Marlow & Sons, where menus scrawled on receipt tape, carpentry contracted from local artisans, and meats sourced from local farms helped shape the Kings County restaurant identity and solidify a global image of #Brooklyn as an exportable brand of crafty hipness. ',\n",
       "  'Reynard is a touch spiffier than Tarlow’s other venues. It felt, in the early days, like a gently commercialized hagiography of Williamsburg’s industrial past, a clean-cut blend of reclaimed wood ceilings, scratched mirrors, patterned tile floors, and distressed brick walls, all in a reasonably priced hotel that boasted killer views of Manhattan. The natural wine list was awesome, the natural light was killer for photo-friendly brunches, and the straightforward American fare was, well, straightforward. But it never wowed.',\n",
       "  'Five years later, Reynard has earned its patina. The dining room feels like a refuge from the neighborhood’s current state of Disneyfication, with more and more exorbitant apartment buildings of glass and steel choking up the skyline, and with proliferating street-mural adverts commissioned by the likes of Spotify, Microsoft, Delta, and Tinder.',\n",
       "  'And the food, with its service-included pricing, now deserves its own narrative. It finally wows. Lecki’s all-day American fare makes hearth cooking feel like the primal — yet studied — act of deliciousness it should be, rather than the performative and pedestrian act it’s become in too many restaurants installing Cadillac grills. Her creations, more gutsy than gut-busting, are lighter and brighter than much of what she put out at The Breslin, with no fatty steaks for two, with acid used strategically, and with the flavor of fire feeling more like a subtle background note than an overwhelming act of quasi-barbecue.',\n",
       "  'Consider the pig’s face — a bit of an acquired taste. Lecki makes it user-friendly by heating it up on the griddle, rendering all the gelatinous bits soft, and bringing out the dish’s porcine perfume. She lays a small pile of lettuce on the side for wrapping, along with a little bit of pickled jalapenos to cut through the fats with spice and zing. There’s your Italian-American bo ssam right there. ',\n",
       "  'Lecki gets more aggressive with the fire in her urchin course. She torches pita over the wood coals, dusts it with a speckle of house-made togarashi, and pairs the piping-hot flatbread with cold Massachusetts uni on the half shell. This bread and butter course — with its palate shocking chaud-froid — brilliantly uses the heat of the chile and the smoke of the grill to tame the squishy funk of the sea.',\n",
       "  'To achieve this level of precision, Lecki had Tarlow and a local steelworker remove the kitchen’s old Argentinian grill, whose raw-wood style of cooking could overpower ingredients with acridity, she tells me. In its place, Tarlow installed a plancha and hanging racks, allowing for more controlled cooking. ',\n",
       "  'Garlic slowly smokes while hanging over the hearth; cooks squeeze the sweet pulp into a soul-warming soup fortified with leftover meat stock, squishy pecorino breadcrumbs, and tangy whey. The yellow broth’s opacity belies its nimble flavors; it nearly vibrates on the tongue. The portion is not small, but because of its balance, it manages to work as an appetizer for one.',\n",
       "  'This being Reynard, of course, it’s likely some readers and regulars have a very specific question: How’s brunch? Well, it’s great, but it’s lightened up a bit. Translation: The famed Dutch pancake, often laden with ham and Gruyere, has been banished from the menu.',\n",
       "  'Instead, diners will encounter delicate egg crepes and crisp socca — southern French chickpea pancakes topped with a tangle of burnished cauliflower and a smattering of za’atar. ',\n",
       "  'Maple-glazed ham arrives as a single pink slice, the thickness of cardboard and curled at the edges from a proper smoking. The meat packs notes of salt and sugar, with a dusting of aji dulce for a fruity heat. Paired with soft, prosciutto-studded collards and two poached eggs, the Southern-leaning dish never veers into nap-inducing territory; the portion size will leave the non-boozing brunch patron feeling refreshed. Same goes for the roast beef, cooked rare, sliced thin, and slathered in horseradish sauce over chicories. It reads like a steakhouse lunch on the menu; it turns out to be a nimbly beefy salad in disguise.',\n",
       "  'Back at dinner, Lecki lights up the grill for house-ground merguez, a loosely packed sausage stuffed with lamb hearts, liver, kidneys, and fermented red chiles. She lets the warm, smoky, gamy flavors build, and then uses a verdant cilantro and parsley salad to cleanse the palate. ',\n",
       "  'She fries plump East Coast oysters and wraps them in tender lettuces. She sears ’nduja-stuffed squid to an ethereal creaminess. She pan-sears Peconic Bay scallops, leaving the interior cool and rare, while imparting the exterior with a complex campfire char. She grills pork coppa to a breathtaking medium rare; some bites are as tender as filet mignon, and others pack a welcome heft. All sit in a gorgeous bright broth of apple cider vinegar, pork fat, and mushrooms. ',\n",

Bartenders caramelized drinks with blazing-hot pokers and clarified ripe bananas into rum with centrifuges and froze basil leaves with liquid nitrogen. The complex techniques and wacky flavors made it the city’s only fully experimental bar. And somehow it was also an accessible experiment, with $14 drinks, $12 ham plates, and no reservations.',\n",
       "  'It closed in 2016, but less than a year later, New York again has a modernist cocktail parlor, albeit in a slightly different latitude and altitude: the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental on Columbus Circle. The Aviary, a spinoff of the Chicago original, is the long-awaited East Coast debut from the folks behind Alinea, a world-renowned gastronomic playpen where chefs send out fried chicken liver mousse made to look like volcanic ash, and where patrons suck the helium out of green apple taffy balloons.',\n",
       "  'So it’s no surprise when The Aviary’s bartenders — a loose term, as the bar is a glass-walled kitchen — send out the following bit of whimsy: coffee-laced Manhattans in clear bags filled everything-bagel perfume. A server cuts open the bag and the scent lingers for just a second. It is only transportive in the sense that it evokes something New Yorkers eat every day for a buck. Here, that aroma and the very average mix of rye and vermouth it perfumes cost $27. ',\n",

Those bites, which include a littleneck clam with spicy cucumber, as well as a little knob of tomato-horseradish gelee, are uncomplicatedly refreshing. Then comes the bloody itself. A server pours it into a hole in the middle of the garnish tray, funneling the liquid into a small glass bowl filled with fresno pepper ice balls.

       "  'Another tip: Skip the ramen, an appetizer-sized portion of mushroom dashi and insubstantial noodles for $27.

       "  'For many of us, the first Indian cuisine we fell in love with came from Punjab: lamb and chicken in thick gravies pungent with ginger, garlic, and masalas, flaunting powerful flavors that put European gravies to shame. And those meaty curries were matched with meatless ones that taught Americans new ways to look at vegetables like spinach, potatoes, and cauliflower. But as the present century dawned, other regional Indian cuisines from places like Kerala, Hyderabad, and Gujarat came to supplant — or at least rival — it in our affections. Now, the Punjabi menu has returned at Chawla’s 2 in enhanced form, and the time has come to give it another try.',\n",
       "  'The Punjab is a region that sprawls across India’s northern frontier into Pakistan. It lies along the Silk Road, which has historically provided ready access to spices that are often used by the handful. The Sikh religious group’s center and principal temple is there in Amritsar, a city that’s name-checked several times on the menu. Amritsari kulcha ($3.49) is one example — an herb-flecked, potato-stuffed flatbread brushed with oil. It could become your favorite Indian bread.',\n",

Attar Singh Chawla. The “2” in the moniker signifies a modern approach to cooking, featuring locally sourced ingredients and a menu emphasizing tandoori cooking and adding other fare like Indo-Chinese.

Then you can also explore the appetizers, which are hidden away in the sections called “Sides” and “From the Fryer.”',\n",

Most places it’s greasy and syrupy, but here the dish is relatively light. With similar flavors, lollipop chicken deploys wings with the flesh pushed to the end of the bone, making them look like Chupa Chups. For vegetarians, chilly paneer and chilly mushroom — using a common Indian spelling of “chili” — are good choices. A particularly filling starter is keema naan, a naan stuffed with ground meat that comes with a bucket of mild gravy.',\n",

Cream chicken ($8.99) is the menu’s flagship: boneless bird in a buff-colored sauce lacking the expected masalas. It tastes herbal and almost French. One of the herbs is certainly fenugreek, and the recipe, formulated by the chain’s founder, is further enriched with crushed cashews.',\n",

Also good is macarron de la abuela, a grandmotherly dish of penne, chicken, and forest mushrooms that one-ups chicken cacciatore.

The correct match for all the muted, silky flavors is the Breakfast of Champions, a restrained blend of rum, peanut milk, black sesame, and toasted coconut shavings. It is a cocktail, yes, but it also recalls the globally popular milk teas (sometimes studded with tapioca balls) for which Taiwan is famous.',\n",
       "  'Any cuisine in a globalizing world can be difficult to define; what makes the food of Taiwan so fascinatingly complex is that the island nation has seen its diverse gastronomy fueled by a long history of immigration.

Brown coats dark-meat nuggets in a cayenne-laced sweet-potato starch, fries them to a dense crunch, and drenches the morsels in a butter-spiked persimmon hot sauce.

In the shadow of vine-covered trellises, with a light breeze blowing off the Gowanus and cicadas humming in the trees, tables and a blue-tiled bar beckoned in the sunken backyard of what was formerly The Pines. Hunkered next to the restaurant was a wood-fired oven, where meats were grilled and flatbreads cooked on a griddle, everything emerging infused with the heady odor of smoke. To sit and enjoy a cocktail as your dinner was prepared in plain view was to experience the highest form of culinary expectation. ',\n",
       "  'And so a table of friends and I relaxed in the early evening just as the sun was setting and enjoyed a soupy shrimp ceviche known as an aguachile, a vinegary rabbit salpicon, and a mole amarillo of chicken with green romano beans in a lovely orange sauce. One of the virtues of Claro, run by chef TJ Steele, is its concentration on the food of Oaxaca, a brilliant cuisine from southern Mexico rarely seen in New York City.',\n",
       "  'The highlight of my first meal at Claro, and one enjoyed in memory days later, was the pork rib memela ($16), a hand-patted flatbread topped with shredded meat and white cheese, with just enough chile de arbol to give it zing and acidity. The outdoor kitchen — and the way it imbues smoke into dishes — certainly is an asset.',\n",
       "  'But on my following visits, some wood-fire cooked items weren’t available, though the owners say the outdoor kitchen is functional year-round. The menu had shifted around considerably. Could Claro make up for its wood oven deficit? The short answer is yes. Replacements included a heart-warming chicken consommé with masa dumplings and shredded kale that did a convincing imitation of matzo ball soup, and a chile relleno stuffed with chorizo and potato sprawled in an earthy tomato sauce. The memela menu had been expanded, and so had the range of raw fish dishes and the selection of moles, too.',\n",
       "  'Let’s look at the moles first. These represent the cooking of indigenous nations that resided in Oaxaca before Cortes arrived in the early 16th century, painstaking sauces often containing chiles, nuts, herbs, spices, and even chocolate. In fact, the most famous of these, attributed to the state of Puebla just north of Oaxaca, is often called simply “mole.” Legendarily, Oaxaca has seven moles, identified by color and each having its own special uses. These are so difficult to make that many restaurants don’t bother.',\n",
       "  'Not so at Claro. Its menu includes mole negro ($32), a thick, midnight-black sauce with just a trace of sweetness that one-ups Pueblan mole by toasting the spices first. Claro puts a duck leg in it, sprinkles sesame seeds on top, and sides it with a rotating roster of vegetables, which on my visit included delicata squash and brussels sprouts. The sprouts didn’t really belong, but who demands absolute authenticity? The other mole currently on the menu is a mole rojo (red mole) with pork cheeks. Please, Claro, more moles! ',\n",
       "  'In its post-summer menus, the restaurant has gone wild with tostadas. These crisp toasted tortilla platforms are often used in Mexico as staging areas for ceviches. Claro’s yellowfin tuna tostada ($22) is perfect in every way, pink nuggets of fish mixed with blood orange and crunchy chicharron, and so is an octopus tostada with pickled chiles and tocino, a crispy pork belly. The biggest dud on a menu that contains few is a tostada smeared with a ground Wagyu beef tartare, seasoned with the kind of gusano (worm) salt more often used on the rim of a margarita. I say bring on the insect larvae — but not in this usage.',\n",

The green papaya slaw lacked so much, including kick, I thought perhaps the kitchen had accidentally shredded the fruit and then forgot about it. The smoked burrata came with a big show (a glass dish lifted in a magic puff of smoke) and a befuddling cold mush of shaved Brussels, spiced squash, apples, and pecans.

The cuts are marked by tags that flutter like a swarm of moths, each one denoting how long it has been dry-aging. ',\n",
       "  'The room glows red. Owner Simon Kim says the red lighting makes the “meat look sexier,” which is only partially accurate; the steaks aged for half a year look like petrified driftwood.',\n",
       "  'I think of this museum exhibit of meat when I watch my server torching a rib-eye over a gold-rimmed grill set in the middle of a grey soapstone table in the dining room. I slather the meat in sweet-spicy ssamjang sauce and wrap it in a lettuce leaf, which I promptly eat, and which fills my mouth with the perfume of beef and barnyard. I pair this with a small glass of frozen rosé, also known as frosé, which I suck up through a pink flamingo straw. ',\n",
       "  'In the domain of the American steakhouse, an institution dedicated to blood, beef, men, money, and martinis, few things disappoint the way dry-aged beef often does. That’s not to disrespect this celebrated form of charcuterie, wherein beef hangs in a climate-controlled room to concentrate flavor and develop a funk like a good blue cheese. But more often than not, servings would be better articulated as a single small course in a tasting than an entree the size of a catcher’s mitt. To continue the metaphor: Would you really want to eat an entire wheel of Stilton in one sitting? ',\n",
       "  'Some restaurants get around this dilemma by putting less age on their steaks. Cote, by contrast, allows for a more elegant and flavorful solution: You order your dry-aged beef not as an oversized entree but rather as part of a $45 prix fixe that includes all the food a person needs on a given night — and then some. That heady rib-eye is all of four or five bites. Then you move onto wagyu flat iron that’s not aged, followed by marinated short rib.',\n",
       "  'The people behind this chic restaurant still know how to overindulge; excess, after all, is the point of a steakhouse. But they also know not to annihilate your palate with the beef they cultivate in their crimson basement quarantine zone.',\n",
       "  'Cote —  a slickly designed restaurant split into bench-tables up front and cushier booths in the back and a standing table that bisects the space — is one of the city’s most exhilarating places to eat beef. That’s an unexpected superlative for a steakhouse that peddles frosé or a restaurant that some might not even consider a steakhouse. ',\n",
       "  'The standard classification for a venue like Cote is a Korean barbecue spot, but taxonomically, an institution that pairs red meat with vegetable sides, starches, and copious amounts of alcohol is just as much a member of the larger steakhouse community as Keens or a Sparks. ',\n",
       "  'What distinguishes Cote from the pack is the fact that Kim and chef David Shim embrace the affinities between Korean barbecue spots and stereotypically American bastions of beef. Some of their riffs are obvious. Shim presents a cool wedge salad with tofu sesame dressing instead of blue cheese, shrimp over ice with a spicy gochujang-laced dip instead of cocktail sauce, as well as a thin fan of house-smoked pork belly with jalapenos instead of steak-like slab bacon. ',\n",
       "  'Others differences are more subtle. Clubby blinds are banished in favor of open windows: Passers-by can see straight through to the bar’s pink neon sign to the modern artwork hanging in back. Expensive combo platters, typical of Korean grill spots, are nixed in favor of that affordable prix-fixe, called a “Butcher’s Feast,” which means even a solo diner can sample a tasting menu of four different cuts — and too many banchan to count — for a fair price.',\n",
       "  'Almost every meal at Cote includes dry-aged rib-eye –– rarely found at Korean grill spots — sliced from cuts that’ve hung for at least 45 days, versus the more traditional 28 days. Here, that age difference translates into every bite with a nutty aroma that doesn’t detract from the flavor. ',\n",
       "  'Customers with more cash can sample meats aged even longer: A 150-day aged strip, seldom seen in any city restaurant, runs $99. That oversized steak recalls a good Iberico and, with a muskiness that’s almost past prime, is not for everyone. But for lovers of dry-aged beef, what Cote offers here is sublime.',\n",
       "  \"Keep in mind that Cote’s Shinpo smokeless grills, like at most Korean grill spots, don't produce the same level of char as a French pan roast, or a Peter Luger-style broiler. This style of cookery results in a less intense Maillard reaction that’s about browning for flavor. And that’s okay, because the softer cooking coaxes the flavors of the meat regardless.\",\n",
       "  'The meal unfurls at a slower pace than at a high turnover Korean spot like New Wonjo or Jongro BBQ. Your waiter, who does most of the cooking, kicks off the Butcher’s Feast with hanger steak, which she sears for no more than two minutes, then disappears to tend to a grill at another table. The cut tastes of blood and salt, with a tang of offal. The waiter then reappears and prepares the Kobe flat iron, then scoots away again, before coming back for chuck flap (a $38 supplement), which collapses in the mouth with the ease of lobster knuckle and bursts with a clean meatiness. You get used to this efficient back-and-forth which feels less obtrusive than the constant clearing of silverware and re-plating at a tasting menu venue.',\n",
       "  'The last cut of beef is galbi, short rib marinated in sweet soy mirin. It’s grilled nice and long, resulting in a crusty, sugary chew. If all this flesh and fat, whether dry-aged or not, sounds like a bit much, keep in mind you have a table full of banchan to quell the funk, from jalapeno-topped, pickled chayote, to sweet cured squid, to a giant preserved perilla leaf, to a fluffy egg soufflé that could easily command $20 at a Soho brunch spot. ',\n",
       "  'Unlike potatoes and creamed spinach, banchan delivers balance to the meal, making this Korean-American steakhouse a better spot for enjoying 45-day, dry-aged beef than just about any other restaurant.',\n",
       "  'The meal winds down with a bowl of spicy kimchi stew to aid digestion, and then a tiny, tart cup of soft serve — a more logical coda than a giant slice of chocolate cake, or a $35 sundae. ',\n",
       "  'That’s the brilliance of Kim and Shim: They put together a menu based on international eclecticism rather than American steakhouse dogma, a lesson that the city’s stodgy purveyors of beef could heed. At Cote, the future of the New York steakhouse is looking outward, not inward. ',\n",
       "  'Cost: Butcher’s block tasting — enough food for most people — runs $45 per person. A la carte appetizers range from $12 to $18, while individual cuts of meat run $34 (hanger steak) to $44 (dry-aged rib-eye). Extra-dry aged cuts for two can command $99 or more.',\n",
       "  'Sample dishes: Wedge salad with bacon and tofu sesame dressing, steak tartare, Korean pork belly, spicy kimchi stew, dry-aged rib-eye, angel hair pasta with apples and iceberg lettuce, soft-serve.',\n",

This is starting to change as more Taiwanese restaurants open in Flushing, Elmhurst and Sunset Park, with dishes that display regional flavors from Shanghai, Sichuan,Guangdong, and Beijing. These influences reflect Taiwan's history, reaching back to the Chinese Revolution — when it was flooded with refugees — and earlier. The island's culinary mix has also included Japanese, European, and American influences: a reminder of its occupation during the last World War and its location as a maritime crossroads. \",\n",
       "  \"Witness Taiwan's mouthwatering menu at Happy Stony Noodle in Elmhurst. The location is a block up Broadway from Taiwan Gourmet, an old-guard place that treats the historic bill of fare more ponderously, tendering whole fish, stir fries, and tempura, a Japanese import. By contrast, Happy Stony is a rollicking and lighthearted noodle shop offering contemporary fare like popcorn chicken and sweet-potato French fries, as well as noodles in soups and stir fries.\",\n",

The room is big and boxy and painted buff, with black-and-white photos of agrarian scenes that might make you think Taiwan is filled with farms, like some oceangoing Iowa.',\n",
       "  'Taiwan has its own dim sum tradition distinct from Cantonese dishes, which includes dishes like the wonderful oyster pancake ($7.95). Inside a flattened egg flapjack flecked with scallions lurk a plethora of freshly shucked oysters. This omelet may have inspired one of the first Chinese-American dishes created during the California Gold Rush and called Hangtown fry. But the contemporary Taiwanese rendition has globs of translucent sweet-potato starch, which play tag with the bivalves, creating a confusion as to what kind of goo you’re eating at the moment.',\n",

Of the many bowls I tried, my favorite, number 52, was beef stew and tendon with flat rice noodles ($7.50). In it, magnificent wobbly chunks of tendon vie with richly textured stew beef for the attention of your chopsticks. The broth is red and slightly spicy.

       "  'In the 1990s, Tuscan cuisine blazed across the culinary firmament like a comet. Helped along by Frances Mayes’ book-turned-movie, Under the Tuscan Sun, Americans were besotted with the region’s simple and elegant cooking. We savored pungent pecorino and rustic salami as a first course, just-made pastas lightly sauced as a second, and third courses of meat, fish, or fowl unencumbered by sides or starches. And the cuisine’s emphasis on fresh and locally sourced ingredients was to profoundly influence New York dining in the decades that followed.',\n",
       "  'But, once translated into the American dining idiom, there was little in this sea of red-sauced abnegation that could be described as truly Tuscan. We simply lacked the original ingredients and the will to faithfully replicate the cuisine. Chefs came to use the term as code for any approach that emphasized pasta and a greater proportion of produce, ushering in an era when even TV dinners and cans of cat food were labeled “Tuscan.”',\n",
       "  'Real Tuscan restaurants in the city have remained rare. Some of the best have been founded by expat Tuscan chefs like Rita Sodi (I Sodi and Via Carota) and Cesare Casella (the now-closed Beppe and Maremma). Now we have another: Fiaschetteria Pistoia — named for the straw-basketed Chianti bottle — opened a few months ago at 11th and C. This improbably located spot was founded by Emanuele Bugiani, whose family owns Fiaschetteria La Pace in Pistoia, a trattoria 30 kilometers northwest of Florence.',\n",
       "  'Several of the antipasti have Florentine origins. There’s pappa col pomodoro ($10), a brightly colored porridge of bread crumbs and tomatoes that tastes like a bowlful of summer sunshine. Few New York restaurants have had the testicoli to serve it (Tribeca’s Pepolino is the only other I know of), since the dish looks like something intended for babies and invalids. Another Florentine dish, sformatino di zucchine is also found among antipasti, a flan flecked with summer squash in a delicate Parmigiano sauce.',\n",
       "  'A dish you’d find everywhere in the sunflower-strewn Tuscan countryside is crostini Toscani ($13). This plate of toasts deploying the region’s notoriously saltless bread — said to be a medieval response to a papal salt tax — comes with a creamy puree of chicken livers redolent of sage and other herbs. Skip the more elaborate version with mushrooms and baked ham: The livers are heavenly enough.',\n",
       "  'Yes, you can get prosciutto San Daniele from northern Italy. Here, it’s sliced on the red, hand-cranked slicer that’s the focus of the dining room and turns heads every time the waiter steps up to it. Better still is the prosciutto Toscano. Every hilltop town in Tuscany has its own version of this cured-but-not-cooked ham, which slices up salty and funky and a bit lighter than its more expensive San Daniele counterpart.',\n",
       "  'The décor at this restaurant might be termed East Village rustic, including the usual rickety tables, tin ceilings, and crumbling walls, forming the local equivalent, I suppose, of a rural osteria in the Tuscan countryside. Posters of canned food products dating from the 60s adorn the walls, perhaps the work of some Italian Andy Warhol. In the back corner is a pasta-making machine, and one of the cooks frequently steps out of the kitchen to tend it, making pastas that, if not all Tuscan, are uniformly delicious.',\n",
       "  'Why the pasta menu departs from its purely Tuscan agenda is unclear, but we have a very nice cacio e pepe ($16), using fettuccine laved in a Roman sauce of pecorino and black peppercorns, the latter ground a little too fine. Pappardelle in a Bolognese ragu is also available along with gnocchi with pesto such as might be found in Genoa. The most purely Tuscan pasta is a broad noodle here called by its generic name of maccheroni in a chunky wild-boar sauce. All are quite fantastic, but make sure you examine the brief specials menu before ordering a second course. It often includes gnudi, which are wrapper-free ravioli made popular in New York by April Bloomfield at the Spotted Pig. Looking like ping pong balls flattened by a forearm smash, this version features spinach and cheese.',\n",
       "  'As in a Tuscan roadhouse, the secondi menu presents only three or four choices per evening that once again range over Central Italy, and might include baccala alla Livornese, meatballs in sauce, veal scallopine, or, on one occasion, an olive-oiled New York strip ($30): a decent imitation of beefsteak Florentine. That the specials menu had called it a veal roast didn’t bother me. In an old-fashioned Tuscan way the proprietor was simply providing the best of what he had to offer.',\n",

A little quick math will tell you that the smaller pies cost about 18 cents per square inch, with the bigger ones around 9 cents. Yes, the big pies are twice as good a deal. However, the small pies allow you to try more of them. They also provide a larger proportion of the smoky crust that is the real payoff of these pizzas, which provide a meager quantity of toppings. That’s the aesthetic and it certainly improves profitability.',\n",
       "  'Stippled with char, those crusts are superb, with an ethereal lightness and no yeasty aftertaste. The ones I liked best were the Napoli, pungent with Kalamata olives and anchovies, reminding us how Neapolitans love sharp flavors; and the self-named Santa Panza, which features pungent scamorza cheese in addition to the creamy and mellow buffalo mozzarella that stealthily appears on most pies unannounced on the menu. It also boasts crumbled Italian sausage and sage — making the pie seem more Tuscan than Neapolitan.',\n",
       "  'Come to think of it, the ortolana, featuring roasted vegetables, and the salame picante, are also good choices. The second accomplishes the move of putting soppressata — a dried pork sausage adored by Brooklyn Italian-Americans, many of whom came originally from Apulia — right on a pizza. This is also the restaurant’s meatiest pie.',\n",
       "  'There are a few salads and starters, as well as cheese and charcuterie platters, all perfectly adequate. One menu novelty is the burrata appetizer ($12), which features a large lump of cheese, bread, and slices of ham or salami depending on the cook’s whim, making a nice combination while fulfilling your cheese and charcuterie needs simultaneously. Tasting mildly of smoke, the vegetable apps also make good starters, including one of zucchini in a caper-bearing tomato sauce ($11), and a spinach casserole dabbed with béchamel that does a convincing imitation of a steakhouse side.',\n",
       "  'But you’re actually better off going directly to the specials menu — with a half-dozen choices per evening — for your antipasti. One evening there was a starter of cotecchino, a large-bore pork and pork rind cooked sausage and a powerful garlic bomb, served with miniature lentils on a puck of polenta. Superb! Another time there was a salad that featured oven-roasted fruit, tart and crisp-skinned, though not quite enough of it.',\n",
       "  'Any of the risotto specials are great, too, including one that featured a scoop of chicken-liver mousse on top. But the most appealing special of all, and the best dish I ate at Santa Panza, was a special pizza. It presented thin slices of porchetta — another meat almost never seen on pizza — curling on top, along with pickled artichokes, fontina and mozzarella, and fresh oregano ($16). The special represented the kind of clever and aggressive pie making that characterized Roberta’s in its early days and made me resolve to return to Santa Panza again.',\n",

       "  '\\n  For historical reasons, much of the Vietnamese food served in New York City originated in the southern part of the country, specifically in the Mekong Delta southwest of Saigon. First brought here by refugees after the Vietnam War, the fare of that region shows Cambodian and Chinese influences, and showcases meals served over broken rice, as well as beef pho served with a phalanx of sauces and a forest of herbs and sprouts — as if the soup needed a little help. But gradually, over the last few years, restaurants with a northern Vietnamese bent have appeared. Most, like Nightingale 9 and Bunker, have been founded by restaurateurs who have visited Vietnam and become enchanted with its street food.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'The latest is Hanoi House. Located just off Tompkins Square on a block with an incredibly diverse array of restaurants, it was opened a few months ago by Sara Leveen and Ben Lowell, who worked previously at Buddakan and Upland. The chef is John Nguyen, who grew up in Orange County, California — one of the country’s hotbeds of Vietnamese cuisine — but has also worked mainly in Stephen Starr restaurants. Hanoi House is small and cramped, decorated with tropical storm shutters, wooden lattice work, and potted foliage that give it a colonial vibe. The layout is mainly barroom, with the best seats in a small raised room at the rear. Sitting there makes you feel like a spy in Graham Greene’s The Quiet American.',\n",
       "  'The beef pho (pho bac, $13) — unlike other phos in town — does away with plates of basil, sprouts, and mint, as well as the jars of vinegar, fish sauce, Sriracha, pickled peppers, and chile oil. But oh! The fragrance that rises up with the steam. There’s a hint of cinnamon, perhaps, and the double allium wallop of scallions and charred onions, but the main thing that tears into your nostrils is beef, beef, and more beef. Instead of multiple beef cuts, beef balls, and offal, there are only two things bobbing in its depths: filet mignon and brisket.',\n",
       "  \"On the side you'll find pickled garlic and chiles, which you should dump in the bowl, and a spicy and garlicky house-made sauce, which ought to be reserved as a dip for the filet and brisket. Two other add-in options are available at additional cost: oxtail and marrow bone. Skip the marrow, which only takes up space, but by all means have some oxtail. The stringy and fatty meat serves as a contrast to other cuts.\",\n",
       "  'Occasionally, pho ga is offered, with chicken instead of beef. This, too, is a formidable dish, and one just as popular as pho bac in the outdoor food stalls of the Vietnamese capital. Either soup is the best reason to visit Hanoi House, but there are plenty of others, too, like the bun cha ($21). When it arrives to a table, bun cha seems like a totally random assortment of ingredients, including a small bowl of rice noodles (called \"bun,\" pronounced \"boon\"); a reservoir of sweet, thick broth swimming with pork meatballs wrapped in betel leaves, carved veggies, and irregular hunks of pork; a pile of lettuce and herbs; and rows of spring rolls.',\n",
       "  'The spring rolls are fabulous, bumpy and crisp and tasting of crab and pork. (They’re available as an app for $9.) Really, you can eat the bun cha any way you want. One method involves picking up little piles of ingredients with your chopsticks, dipping them in the broth, and then downing them. Another is to treat the bowl of noodles as a staging area, dumping everything, including lettuce and herbs, into it a little at a time.',\n",

The meat practically glows; its crimson hues could qualify as bioluminescent in this inky, jazz-filled room. Heady carafes of jus accompany each cut, lending the presentation a carnivorous perfume.

The curd is sour at first, then gives way to a whisper of tropical fruit so gentle it’s more of a memory than a proper aroma.

Atla soaks it overnight, pours it into a shallow brown bowl, then tosses chia with flax seeds, pumpkin seeds, candied ginger, and cashews. Oatmeal, traditionally, is a nourishing, rib-sticking dish. This chia pudding with delicate notes of cinnamon and vanilla is about as filling as the foam off a cappuccino.',\n",

Atla isn’t so much of a Cosme-like dinner destination as it is of-the-moment, an unevenly delicious all-day breakfast spot that weaves its Mexican accents into the California dreaming prevalent at spots like Dimes or El Rey. ',\n",
       "  'I don’t typically single out morning meals in my starred reviews because serious chefs don’t typically take breakfast very seriously, if they serve it at all. The conventional line of thinking is that a.m. diners are looking more for standard nourishment than culinary inspiration, which is why restaurants that do serve breakfast rely more heavily on tried-and-true classics than the ambitious repertoire of a Michelin-starred chef. ',\n",
       "  'Breakfast has been changing as ambitious restaurants look for more ways to squeeze profit out of the spaces they pay increasingly high rents for, and — as restaurants like abcV in New York and Sqirl in Los Angeles show — there’s a market for being more creative about morning offerings.',\n",
       "  'Atla is at the front of that change. Eschewing bacon, pancakes, or egg sandwiches, Olvera’s breakfast takes cues not from diner culture with its fill ‘em up mantra but rather modern restaurant culture, letting diners build small tastings of sweet and savory fare. ',\n",

At Atla, it’s not a problem as long as you’re willing to put up with overcooked eggs in a bland tomato sauce. The better call are those masa cakes I was telling you about, tlacoyos anointed with spring peas crushed in the style of refried beans. The vegetable laced with mint simultaneously jolts the palate with chlorophyllic sugars and incendiary serranos.',\n",

',\n",
       "  'Kudos to Olvera along with his James Beard award-winning lieutenant Daniela Soto-Innes, for blurring the lines between what Americans eat in the morning versus the evening. This means anyone can arrive in the early morning and order enchiladas in warming chipotle-laced red salsa, fragrant green tomatillo salsa, and queso blanco.

Even in the steak tartare relleno — bits of raw strip loin tucked into a giant poblano with carrots, potatoes, and scallions — the dominant flavors are the vegetal tang of the pepper and the pureed habenero, tomatillo, and pumpkin seeds. The raw cubes of beef round out an ode to chile peppers. Chicken caldo, in turn, serves as a delivery mechanism for a salad’s worth of basil, oregano, and cilantro. And the largest quantity of pork on the menu comes in the humble chicharon guisado, soft blankets of pig skin that serves as sponges for the hot crock of salsa verde they’re stewed in, a dish that was maybe a bit too steamy for a recent 90 degree day.',\n",
       "  'And yet, in light of this stunning showcase of vegetables, herbs, and chiles, Atla’s best dish is somehow the avocado toast, that typically overpriced brunch dish that pales in comparison to the cheaper, tastier, more bespoke versions you can make at home. Soto-Innes turns a thick slice of ciabatta into a veritable vegetarian buffet, smearing it with goat cheese, guacamole, onions, and tomatoes ranging in color from red to green to purple to yellow. It’s a shockingly balanced blend of fat, funk, salt, and acid, with leaves of cilantro and slices of jalapeño that impart verdant fragrance with aggressive heat.',\n",

       "  'Herb guacamole: Large chunks of well-salted avocados with whole mint and basil leaves. You scoop this up with a single, massive chile-dusted purple tostada, which fully covers the guacamole bowl in the modern, Ignacio Mattos-style of lettuce covering an entire steak. The plating speaks to the primacy of corn in the Olvera pantheon of ingredients. But more practically, this is just a delicious, perfectly executed dip.',\n",
       "  'Mushroom quesadillas: Melted cheese with mushrooms in a tortilla. This trio of humble ingredients is ubiquitous throughout New York, but at Atla, the heady fungi, stretchy cheese, and robust corn reach otherworldly heights. This is a near-perfect dish. ',\n",

If the corn husk pudding at Cosme is brilliantly restrained in its sweetness and expression of how corn can boast a vegetal tang, the tamal pushes corn’s savory side to an unwelcome extreme. Skip it.',\n",

The Grill Room, together with the adjoining Pool Room, was the crown jewel in the empire of the legendary Joe Baum, a trendsetting restaurateur who, here in the Seagram building, would seek to convince stateside gastronomes that seasonal American cuisine, buffeted by tableside, a la minute preparations, could command as much respect as fancy French fare.  ',\n",
       "  'By the time I made a series of three visits in 2008, Claiborne’s statement only held true in the sense that there were few other establishments better geared toward shaking down diners in a way that evoked the excess of a capitalist system that was on the verge of its biggest crash since the Great Depression. Niccolini and Alex Von Bidder lost their lease in 2016, the same year the former plead guilty to misdemeanor assault stemming from charges of sexual abuse. That July, The Four Seasons took its final bow. ',\n",
       "  'Nearly a year and $30 million worth of renovations later, The Grill Room has transformed into an energetic and exhilarating chophouse, The Grill, while the adjoining Pool Room, a sedate seafood spot that I’ll review this fall, has become The Pool.

It shows off a style of meaty midcentury indulgences and warm, avuncular, let me-tell-you-another-story-about-JFK hospitality that, given the means, I’d partake of twice a week or more. A theme restaurant for the wealthy, but one that puts everyone under a spell that they belong here, on this stage, where it’s always 1950s Manhattan, rain or shine.',\n",

In a vast kitchen, cooks braise endives with black truffles while in the dining room, waiters in Tom Ford tuxedos use a $10,000 tableside torture device to crush poultry parts into the base of a sauce whose notes of blood, salt, and cherrywood recalls the juices that collect at the bottom of a cutting board after a good night of hunting. This is ladled over a tangle of yellow egg noodles in a gold rimmed bowl. It is pure luxury. ',\n",

Here, vegetables and grains come with butter, cream, and crab. Asparagus, the so-called king of vegetables, isn’t cold-pressed or served raw, but creamed into a soup and served underneath a pastry dome. This gently bitter, gently sweet indulgence is known as Jack’s pie and is named after a certain U.S. president who might’ve sampled it here during a birthday celebration. ',\n",
       "  'The genius of Carbone and Torrisi is that they’re not elevating or refining the overpriced, underwhelming Four Seasons that members of the Momofuku generation largely ignored. They’re reimagining an era of restaurants that came and went before many of us were born, an era many of us associate with fictional, hard-drinking advertising executives, an era when well-heeled patrons, during the apogee of what Henry Luce deemed The American Century, traveled to The Four Seasons to experience a uniquely stateside style of fine dining, one whose internationalist tendencies were more of a hat tip than a kowtow to European traditions.',\n",
       "  'Those patrons, old menus show, would come to sample black cherry soup, calf brains en brioche, ham mousse stuffed into a whole peach, and perhaps most famously, wild mushrooms, which contemporary waiters, in their obligatory tableside speeches, remind you were not in great supply until the Four Seasons debuted. If that sounds like an overly staged setup for the the mushroom omelet, consider the following: The egg isn’t so much the main event as it is a loose binder for a pack of earthy maitakes, spongy morels, nutty chanterelles, as well as a few slivers of that preserved black truffle. I sampled this dish twice and both times it was like trying wild mushrooms again for the first time. It is spectacular. ',\n",
       "  'Equally spectacular is the caviar vichyssoise. I don’t typically recommend fish roe at restaurants because it’s a pure product play: Chefs open a can of roe and mark it up. At The Grill, a waiter is quick to tell me the Latin name of the roe (baerri). Like any good baerri, it rolls around the palate like a marble until a flick of the tongue crushes it into an intense and lingering maritime oil. It is the flavor of Osetra times ten, until a clean shot of potato and leek soup cleanses the palate for more. ',\n",

At one level, the dish is magical because of its elevation of an old suburban supper. But even if you’ve never tried hamsteak, a dish found on about zero New York restaurant menus, it still works because of the execution; the silky fattiness, gentle smoke, distinct sweetness, and electric acidity simultaneously qualifies it as the city’s best pork chop and a remarkable act of Mid-Atlantic cooking translated into haute barbecue by way of an extraordinarily fancy restaurant in New York. ',\n",
       "  'That hamsteak, as it turns out, is from an old Four Seasons menu, one from 1964 that I came across online. There’s something energizing in knowing that a preparation, or at least a version on it, is what somebody’s wealthy grandparents might’ve sampled, once upon a time.',\n",

The cuisine makes much of fresh and pickled chiles, black peppercorns (few Sichuan peppercorns), freshwater fish, dried and smoked meats, as well as the province’s vegetable bounty. While it's true you can now find Sichuan restaurants in every corner of the city, real Hunan is still relatively rare.\",\n",

Though it requires expert and attentive work with chopsticks to extract the morsels of flesh, there’s more than you'd think, especially if you probe deep in the cheeks, forehead, and hanging jowls of the great fish.

       "  'No one cares if La Boulangeries and The Groves proliferate. People expect them to. But back when duplication veered into Delfina Pizzeria territory, debate ensued. The California Street location was one thing. Once that broccoli rabe pie started cropping up in Palo Alto and Burlingame, with big plans for further expansion, though, I admit I was bummed. Not for Craig Stoll. Hardworking chefs wholly deserve to make money. I was upset by the notion that a beloved local spot could become — god forbid — a chain.',\n",
       "  'This is all a long-winded way of talking about the new Alta, also known as the second Alta, or Alta MSP — as in: Minnesota Street Project, the adjacent airy, white warehouse that opened in 2016 as an economically sustainable space for art galleries and independent artists. Soon, there will be four Altas, including one in Los Angeles. If Daniel Patterson’s newly formed “Alta Group” has its way, there will someday be Altas around the country.',\n",
       "  'I think that’d be a good thing.',\n",
       "  'Not because of the food, per se. It alone is not worth a mad dash down to an otherwise often-desolate stretch of Dogpatch. Rather, I’d welcome an army of Altas because of Patterson, the man leading the charge: a brainy chef morphing into an ambitious businessman who is meticulous and socially conscious and (with the help of ROC United) committed to hiring a diverse group of good people, serving good food made with good ingredients in a sophisticated yet easy-going atmosphere. Patterson hopes it attracts diners who understand that the aged beef strip loin costs $33 (the priciest item on the dinner menu) because he wants to pay the person washing your dishes as well as he pays the one uncorking your wine.',\n",
       "  'Locals loved the first Alta, the mid-Market pioneer that opened a block from Twitter in 2013. (And the sole survivor after a recent rash of nearby closings.) Which is probably why Patterson picked it to multiply. I only ate dinner there twice, a while ago, and both times I left still feeling hungry and like I’d spent too much money for still feeling hungry.',\n",
       "  'The other day, though, after brunch at Alta MSP, I left so stuffed and satisfied that I almost skipped dinner. My fault for over-ordering (job hazard), but I also blame the fried-chicken sandwich, a comically sized slab of succulent thigh meat encased in a crisp, inch-thick cayenne-tinged crust and set on a soft Della Fattoria bun swathed with a fermented chili-based aioli, with housemade pickles and a daikon-jalapeno slaw. It was spicy. It was messy. It was monstrous. And it turned a fine meal into a memorable one.',\n",
       "  'As did a stroll afterward through the galleries next door. Too bad the current Nobuyuki Takahashi show at the Rena Bransten gallery was better than Alta’s desserts. House-made soft-serve was creamy, but served in mounds so massive it got monotonous. One bowl came topped with a skimpy amount of toffee, salted caramel, and dark chocolate; another was served with strawberries on a lemon-poppyseed cake that was dry and dense.',\n",
       "  'Most of chef Matt Brimer’s midday menu, though, offers more elevated takes on standard San Francisco fare. Here, the requisite little gem salad, in a light and zingy green goddess dressing, was scattered with shaved kohlrabi, coils of boquerones, and dried puffs of farro that gave every other forkful a nice subtle crunch.',\n",
       "  'Instead of $8 avocado toast, it’s $11 grilled levain dressed in dandelion-strewn fromage blanc, hunks of peach, and halved almonds — which seemed superfluous and fell off on the way to my mouth anyway. Another slice came topped in an unwieldy tangle of endive that obscured the flavor of the cubes of smoked black cod and horseradish yogurt below. (Come in for weekday breakfast and toast toppings range from butter [$4] to jam [$5] to Gruyere [$8] to Andante fresh cheese with honey [$9].)',\n",
       "  'I went on a weekend, which meant I was able to try the “Bottomless Mimosa Lab,” an inventive, fresh-squeezed spin on the typical headache-inducing gimmick favored by post-college drinkers looking to get lit by noon. Alta has transformed the bottomless mimosa into a more refined, interactive event that kept us entertained at the table like kids with crayons.',\n",
       "  'Presented with two flutes and a bunch of beakers of various shapes and sizes — including 500 milliliters of refillable Wycliff sparkling wine — we were told to mix our own, mad scientist-style. Fresh lime juice with rhubarb simple syrup was a winner, as was the pucker-worthy OJ with peach vermouth and bitters. We never did request more bubbles. Was it worth $40 dollars for two? No. But it was fun.',\n",
       "  'At dinner, drinks — “coolers” and low-ABV cocktails— were the undeniable stars. The sparkling wine-centric concoctions were so appealing and original and invigorating, I didn’t miss the hard stuff (and felt pretty good the next day to boot). After trying a sip of my friend’s bracing house-made ginger beer, I considered skipping booze altogether, but too late: My Cindy Sherman, an on-tap option named after the contemporary photographer shown next door, was already on its way. The slim glass of berry-red rosé mixed with contratto aperitif, tarragon, and garnished with a strawberry and a sprig of mint had a refreshing tartness to it and wasn’t as sweet as it sounds. Still, it didn’t go down quite as well once the deviled eggs — delicious and doused in kimchi and furikake — arrived. (So much furikake it was like the lid fell off the shaker.) ',\n",
       "  'There were a few highlights from the evening meal, like the Brentwood corn, a wildly flavorful stew of summer kernels, sweet Sun Gold tomatoes, and spicy mini padrons mixed with pops of smoked trout roe and salty green wisps of agretti.',\n",
       "  'The unruly pile of brown-rice puffs (also served during the day) is a well-deserved signature item: cooked, then blended rice, dehydrated and fried into imperfectly shaped cracker-thin vehicles for the accompanying avocado, Espelette-flecked puree. It was silky and smooth, but came in a ramekin too small to match the number of puffs. And they were too brittle to be true dippers, snapping in the dish and forcing us to use our fingers too. Which, even among friends, is a worse offense than double dipping.',\n",
       "  'Alta’s connection to the Minnesota Street Project is both a blessing and a curse. The weekend I went it was packed with young art lovers, with lunching old ladies, with kid-toting couples.',\n",
       "  'But both times I went for dinner, the place — a spare, sleek (if unoriginal) 45-seat space with an inviting, 25-foot-long walnut bar and two matching communal tables — was all but deserted. The restaurant, with its handful of other diners, felt so hushed our rowdy party of four felt something we never do: self-conscious. Plus, peering through the glass wall into the fluorescent-lit gallery, a lone security guard sat at the front desk while outside, a worker power-washed the sidewalk, giving us the feeling that our night was over before it even began.',\n",

       "  'Cost: Dinner for two, including two cocktails, three small plates, two entree-sized plates, and one dessert, including tip — because at Alta tip is included — is around $160. For a hearty, boozy brunch, call it $100. But you can definitely do it cheaper.',\n",

       " ['It’s a quiet Tuesday night in Hayes Valley, the kind of blustery, cold, blah Tuesday night when you’d expect people to stay in and order pho from Caviar or cook up their latest Sun Basket creation. There’s nothing going on at the nearby Nourse Theater, no symphony performing at Davies, no pricey shoe boutiques still open. There’s no reason, really, for anyone to be out and about. And strolling by old-timer Cafe Delle Stelle (plugging free bottles of wine with bills over $60) and newcomer Nightbird, it looks as if, indeed, they’re not. Apparently no one is in the mood for a heady $125 five-course tasting menu.',\n",
       "  'But round the corner to A Mano, and suddenly: crowds, Saturday-night-level crowds, visible through a wall of glass as squeaky clean as the spanking-new condos above. There are people seated at every one of the 90 seats; people crammed into the sliver of a bar sipping Negronis; people spilling onto the sidewalk as a perky host quotes hour-long waits.',\n",
       "  'Everyone, it seems, is in the mood for a $14 bowl of rigatoni.',\n",
       "  'A Mano (Italian for “by hand”) opened in early May with the goal of bringing affordable handmade pasta to a city where mint tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms has tipped toward $22. It aims to be the everylady’s Locanda. Or Cotogna. Or Tosca. Or La Ciccia… The list of San Francisco’s rustic Italian treasures goes on.',\n",
       "  'A Mano is the latest “concept” from prolific restaurateur Adriano Paganini. And it’s a smart concept, if not an entirely new one. Pasta Pomodoro ring a bell? That was Paganini’s idea, too, back in 1994. At its peak, the chain had 40-something outposts, mostly throughout California, the last of which, under new ownership, closed last year. No big loss. It was a cheap, easy place to eat something edible and Italiany. It had no scene and it wasn’t supposed to.',\n",
       "  'But ever since, Paganini has been all about scene, or perhaps the proper word is packaging. In 2008, he turned his attention to pizza and figured out that if he enhanced the ambience and added exceptional cocktails — in a killer location —  he’d be onto something. And he was: Beretta, on a sunny corner of Valencia Street, was an insta-hit, further popularizing the blistered crust-broccolini contorni trend that was already well underway.',\n",
       "  'Starbelly (Castro) and Delarosa (Marina) followed. He then wisely branched out to burgers, hawking humanely raised hamburgers for a reasonable $7.75 at Super Duper, which has 10 locations and counting around the Bay. And now — after adding a Belgian brasserie, tacos, and an Argentine steakhouse to his quiver —  the Milan-born restaurateur has gone back to his roots: pasta.',\n",
       "  'The funny thing is, though, as I slid onto my stool, squeezing into the tightly packed communal table, my first thought was: This place reminds me of Pomodoro, just with sleeker digs and duck-liver mousse. And that was before I’d realized Paganini had anything to do with it.',\n",
       "  'Aesthetically, it’s much cooler than that. The space is airy and oversized, with those floor-to-ceiling glass windows fronting the sidewalk, presumably chosen so passersby can peer in and see how much fun the hipsters are having.',\n",
       "  'Which they are. Filled with awkward first dates and rowdy tables of eight, everyone chatting, laughing, eating affordable food — which flies out of the open kitchen at a fairly rapid clip — A Mano feels like an adult cafeteria with cocktails. Call it a restauteria: a growing breed of eatery where essentially everything costs $16 or less; the kind of place that boasts all the accoutrements of a beloved San Francisco restaurant — but somehow lacks the soul of one.',\n",
       "  'There’s a muted red-white-and-green theme going on (Italy and all); bottles of Aperol and Campari lining the bar like artwork; track lighting (which they fiddled with throughout each night to get it right); and an especially warm, well-trained staff. Still, emotionally… A Mano feels kind of cold. ',\n",
       "  'And, unfortunately, so did my pasta.',\n",
       "  'Not cold cold, in which case I would’ve just sent it back. More lukewarm, with pockets of varying temperatures, like a lake in summer. The problem, perhaps symptomatic of a slammed kitchen still finding its rhythm, plagued not just one pasta, but almost every pasta I had. (The agnolotti dal plin — rich, buttery pillows of pork, roast chicken, and chard — came out piping hot.)',\n",
       "  'The cauliflower bagna cauda was my favorite antipasti, roasted with garlic, lemon, torpedo onions, and chiles. The Monterey squid, too, which came in a tomato-rich stew of chickpeas and romanesco one night, summer corn another. Both were good, albeit not as good as similar iterations elsewhere.',\n",
       "  'There’s always a nightly special, like the Tuscan fried chicken with braised black kale, which was crisp and juicy and, at $20, the most expensive item on the menu. (If you really want to splurge, there’s a $95 bottle of brunello.)',\n",
       "  'The pizza at A Mano is not the focus. (Nor, after trying one topped with asparagus, green garlic, and anchovy, did it seem to me that it should be: the crust was doughy, and the asparagus mushy.) Which is why there are only two or three pizzas per night. And perhaps why, mysteriously, one evening around 7:30 p.m., we watched a delivery guy from Patxi’s, holding a box high above his head, work his way through the throngs to someone in the back.',\n",
       "  'The focus here, per Paganini’s plan, is on pasta. It’s handmade daily with durum, a finer ground semolina flour, under chef Freedom Rains, who cooked at Flour & Water and Incanto before heading the kitchen at Belga. He does seven generously portioned pastas nightly. They change frequently and always with the seasons.',\n",
       "  'Over three separate nights, I tried almost all of them. That agnolotti was the best of the bunch and probably what I’d order if I ever went back. (And I would, if I wanted more of a scene than, say, Souvla, before seeing Pop-Up Magazine or City Arts & Lecture.)',\n",
       "  'The spaghettini, tossed with clams and breadcrumbs, was firm, if dry, but flavorful enough to not render it a total mis-order. But while the pesto tagliatelle with pine nuts, fava beans, and English peas screamed spring — and was clearly made with fresh ingredients — the pasta itself tasted mealy. And the pesto was bland, as if Rains was told to play it safe.',\n",
       "  'Only the campanelle with broccoli di ciccio, a sweet heirloom broccoli, had any kick — and that’s because it was scattered with chile flakes. I actually witnessed more than one table request a side of chile flakes for their pastas mid-meal.',\n",
       "  'It’s what my rigatoni pork sugo needed, too. Like the others, it arrived sort of warm. While hearty, with hunks of braised meat, it lacked the depth and richness of a truly memorable sugo.',\n",
       "  'Therein lies the problem with a place like A Mano — there’s just too much in this town to compare it to. With every bite of my bucatini all’Amatriciana, I kept hoping it would become more like Locanda’s. (It didn’t.)',\n",
       "  'Paganini was quoted last year talking about what drives a successful company. “Why does someone open up one little retail store and somebody else becomes the Gap?” he said.',\n",

       " ['Cajun/Creole restaurant, Gumbo Bros. on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn is a tiny place with a limited menu, which nowadays is a good idea. The décor channels the French Quarter. Faux gas lamps flank a pair of wooden shutters, the tables are made from bowling-alley wood, and the room is painted scarlet. For folks who like to look at things while they eat, there are antique maps, historic street scenes, football helmets, an engraving of Napoleon, and a record sleeve from the late Cajun comedian and cook Justin Wilson, who once published a recipe for a potato salad made with soda crackers.

We now have vast portfolios of restaurants representing Chinese, Indian, and Italian regional cooking, but when it comes to regional American, New York is notably deficient. Sure, there was a fervor for Southwestern in the 80s, and after decades of trying we finally have great Texas barbecues. But our take on the amazing Creole and Cajun cuisine of New Orleans and vicinity has always been disappointing, ever since Paul Prudhomme established a failed outpost of K-Paul’s in SoHo over 25 years ago.',\n",

Crustier rolls wouldn’t work with a po’ boy because the fillings would shoot out the sides.

The same gravy is available over rice for $4. If you miss the oyster po’ boy, the catfish po’ boy is every bit as memorable, made with several filets freshly fried with a coarse and crunchy breading, and doused with a spicy remoulade sauce — mainly mayo. Dill pickle chips complete the ensemble.',\n",

Sitting in the too-quiet room feels discomfiting, like watching a play in an empty theater, but the emptiness makes it easy to take in the space's cool, controlled beauty. Two canvases of colorless, textured scribbles echo the white brick walls on which they're mounted. Hardwoods zigzag across the floor in a herringbone pattern. Translucent fabric chandeliers cast a shivery mauve light. This place could be the great room in the home of a wealthy art dealer, or it might be a Bond villain's lair.\",\n",

Servers hurry these plates from the far end of the dining room, out of a kitchen so striking in its steely brightness that it looks medical in form and function. The master surgeon, German-born chef Günter Seeger, bends over pans on the stove, his mop of curly brown-gray hair falling over his forehead while his cooks stand close, observing and assisting.',\n",

Günter Seeger NY opened in May, though the chef is still struggling to connect with the Manhattan audience that he has been working toward serving for years. And his is a talent that deserves more of a crowd.\",\n",
       "  'Eating at his New York restaurant has unusual resonance for me. I\\'ve been eating Seeger\\'s precise, elegant cuisine since the 1990s, when he ran his first eponymous restaurant in Atlanta, where I live. Most New Yorkers are just hearing of Günter Seeger for the first time, but in Atlanta his name (which he spelled as \"Guenter\" back then) still commands respect in the culinary circles, even a decade after he left the city. Seeger arrived in Atlanta in 1985 to lead the kitchen at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead, turning the hotel\\'s restaurant into an accolade magnet. He was the first chef in the city to win a James Beard award, and he earned the Dining Room its five Mobil stars. He essentially put Atlanta on the national dining map. And long before \"farm-to-table\" was a tired platitude, twenty years ago he helped establish one of the city\\'s most successful farmers markets.',\n",

       "  \"Seeger stayed at the Ritz for nine star-making years, before venturing out on his own with Seeger's, a restaurant housed in a craftsman bungalow converted into a hushed, minimalist warren of dining rooms. Seeger's closed in 2007, after a decade in which the chef defined haute gastronomy for Atlanta, but also divided its dining community. Devotees rhapsodized over his studied, Old-World-meets-New-World creations — tomato gelee and sorbet with horseradish snow, foie gras bonbons covered in pecans, loup de mer with almond mousse.\",\n",
       "  \"But Seeger also had a famously stern demeanor that came through in his work; detractors recoiled at the room's chilly austerity, the stiffness of the service, and the experience's lofty prices. I understood those objections, and sometimes cringed myself at the chef's rigid brand of hospitality, but I could never deny the brilliance of his meticulous approach to cooking, his obsession with clarity of flavor and his unexpected juxtapositions of ingredients.\",\n",
       "  \"Seeger moved to New York after his Atlanta restaurant closed, and proceeded to consult for international grocery chains. In a 2011 interview with Atlanta magazine, he admitted to feeling that the Southern city where he made his name didn't have enough disciples of haute cuisine to support his uncompromising vision. He spoke of aiming for the day when he would cook in Manhattan, where he might be truly appreciated.\",\n",
       "  \"Of course, during Seeger's nine years away from the professional stove the world of tasting-menu restaurants changed irrevocably in New York (and everywhere). Per Se slid. Modern tasting menu game-changers like Momofuku Ko, Semilla, and The Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare upset the old guard with casual counter seating in the dining room and high-low riffs from the kitchen that show off individuality and experimentation.\",\n",
       "  \"Seeger's cooking has always been distinctive, but he also hews to a disappearing sense of luxury: sumptuous trappings, flavors that lean more to the sublime than the edgy. I can't imagine that changing. At sixty-seven years old, Seeger is not a Madonna-style reinventionist; he's more in the vein of Joni Mitchell — a nonconformist. He has a history of remaining true to his lofty vision, no matter the praise or rebuffs that follow.\",\n",

I've been waiting almost a decade to eat Seeger's cooking again — and I find plenty in my meal that makes it worth the wait — though I didn't expect culinary history to repeat itself in quite this way.

At first the nine-course tasting menus, booked ahead of time through restaurant-ticketing startup Tock, cost $185 per person with tip. Over the past five months, after some disappointing reviews (including two stars from Pete Wells in the New York Times), Seeger dropped the pre-paid tickets altogether and tinkered with the restaurant's format. Just in the past weeks, he's started serving $95 four-course menus, with choices for each course, as well as a ten-course set menu for $148.\",\n",

The meal began with cherry tomatoes from Campo Rosso Farms, a vendor at the Union Square Greenmarket who grows out in Berks County, Pennsylvania. The tomatoes arrive still on the vine, along with bowls of anchovy cream — a stripped-down interpretation of bagna cauda. I enjoy this as a kick-off snack, the fresh pop of the fruit against the briny twang of the fish. My friends shrug. It's a little too no-big-deal for them. I laugh to myself. One dish in and we're fully returned to Seeger's domain, the opinions around his food as polarized as ever.\",\n",

Cardamom-infused honey drizzled over the fish slowly runs into the sauce below; it teases out the sweetness of the urchin and equalizes the truffle's pheromone funk. Masterful. I love Seeger's linkage of choosing Malabar spinach, a green that proliferates in South India, in the same setup where he uses cardamom (which thrives in the same region) to such wizardly effect.\",\n",
       "  'The course that preceded the fish was one of Seeger\\'s Atlanta staples: an egg custard, served in an egg shell barely cracked at its crown, flavored with maple cream and scattered with bottarga. In this context it slyly foreshadowed the sea bass dish\\'s musings on sweet and oceanic flavors. But what comes after the sea bass shifts our course entirely. Rounds of beef tenderloin have been poached in a mixture of red wine, port wine, and Madeira; they come with a sauce made from the poaching liquid and some blanched haricots verts. \"This meat has no texture,\" one of my buddies grouses. \"It\\'s a refined take on sauerbraten,\" I respond, referring to the Germanic pot roast. He pauses. \"Okay,\" he says. \"That helps me appreciate it.\"',\n",

Earlier, two oysters arrived nicely zinged with apple and ginger, but also topped with piquant whole chilies that obliterated any taste of the bivalve.

In this restaurant era of bold, global bombasts on the plate, subtlety can too often tip into dullness.\",\n",

It's a Saturday, and the restaurant is full; the servers are more relaxed, having found their rhythms, and the room feels merrier. Again the German-inflected meat course — this time, venison scented with juniper berry alongside crisp-soft red cabbage — comes through as the dinner's spiritual center.

It needs more overtness, more umami.\",\n",
       "  \"In this meal, though, I'm also picking up understated allusions to the South in some of Seeger's cooking, echoes of his time in Atlanta — it's heartening that Seeger hasn't entirely eschewed the region that gave him his first flush of success. Okra relish brings vinegary bite to grilled abalone. For the featured cheese in the course that precedes dessert, Seeger often procures from two standout Georgia producers, Sweet Grass Dairy and Many Fold Farm. And the egg custard tart, tingly with nutmeg, is a sweet finale that Edna Lewis would have championed. (Seeger's pastry chef, Emily Hall, is a talent to watch: She also created a terrific raspberry Savarin, like a fruit-accented baba au rhum, that I relished. In an elegant visual move, Hall’s desserts are served on plates decorated with a riot of florals, a subtle contrapunto to the minimalist plateware of Seeger's savory courses.)\",\n",

It's also called a food hall now, and it is, at its best, a democratizing force. Not only does its structure provides a more affordable way for restaurants to test out their ideas than does a brick-and-mortar location, but it also allows open-palated gastronomes to construct an eclectic meal by traversing only the length of a small shopping mall, instead of a large swath of the city, roaming from poke spot to toast joint without fear of death by vehicular traffic.\",\n",

Like a soup dumpling, you bite off the tip and suck out the insides.

Located at 23 Chatham Square, Szechuan Taste — the name reflected the old-fashioned transliteration of \"Sichuan\"— served a sophisticated take on a cuisine that had recently caused a sensation in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. Clifford mentions that the chef had worked in Taipei for famed landscape painter Chang Ta-chien (who inspired his own Sichuan dish), and the chef’s repertoire in Chinatown included tea-smoked duck flavored with camphor, hot braised live carp, and sliced pork sautéed with fish flavor.',\n",
       "  'During the ensuing decade more Sichuan restaurants popped up in Chinatown, but less predictably, the Upper West Side became a hotbed of the fiery cuisine at places like Szechuan and Szechuan Royal — with the hotness toned down and an emphasis on such tamer recipes as noodles with sesame sauce and baby shrimp, Szechuan-style. It was this blander version of the cuisine, and one lacking Sichuan peppercorns, which were then technically illegal in the US, that eventually worked its way onto the menus of nearly every neighborhood Chinese restaurant in the city.',\n",

There are now at least eight Sichuan restaurants in the neighborhood by my count, plus nearly a dozen stalls that offer it in Flushing’s sprawling food courts. The oldest restaurant is Szechuan House, founded in 1985 (it has cycled through a few names under the same ownership over the years).

I bring this up because during my visits to the rose- and saffron-scented Indian Accent in Midtown, waiters would often regale me with sometimes overly obvious preprandial pedantries before I was allowed to eat. Here’s what I was told: That New Delhi is the capital of India (thank you). That kofta is also known as a meatball (really). And that a particular ingredient, I believe it was garam masala, is an \"Indian word,\" a remark that almost led me to rhetorically ask which of the subcontinent’s 150 languages he was referring to.

And there’s something particularly pleasant about sitting inside the famed manure shed at Blue Hill at Stone Barns while the wait captain literally points out how the latent heat of compost is sous-viding your next course, because the visual imagery is right there, and because poop usually merits an explanation when it’s involved in a $1,000 meal.',\n",

According to an ancient tale, the low-lying land was once defended by a great dyke that kept the waters out. A pair of princes were in charge of the sluice gates, one of whom was a drunkard. When it was his turn to tend the gates one evening, the inebriated prince passed out at low tide leaving them open, and the ocean soon came rushing in, permanently drowning the land. It is said that in times of danger, the ringing of submerged church bells can still be heard. Archeologists who have examined the bottom of the shallow bay have found stones with Roman inscriptions, and artifacts from more recent habitations — meaning that the legend might be true.\",\n",
       "  'Sunken Hundred is also the moniker of a new Welsh restaurant on the border of Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. The exterior is blue clapboard with white trim, suggesting a quayside pub, and just inside the front door tables are cozily wedged into a pair of windowed niches; they\\'re the best seats in the house. Further inside, one wall holds a striking painting of Cantre\\'r Gwaelod (Welsh for \"Sunken Hundred\"), showing haunting shapes rising out of a foggy seascape. A line of tables lie along that wall; opposite, a bar dispenses themed cocktails and a limited selection of wines and beers — alas, no Welsh brews, which are difficult to import, as a waitress confided one evening.',\n",

Stuck to the inside of the bowl is a sheet of nori that may be pulled down with your spoon and sampled every time a little extra flavor is required. In another entrée, a cliff of bone-white hake ($18) rises out of a sea of chunky tomato sauce flavored with butter and seaweed, giving the fish more flavor than it rightfully possesses.

The space retains its\\xa0Old Hollywood magnetism.Coming here never feels stale. It’s easily among the top five most beautiful restaurant spaces in LA.  Charlie Chaplin, the story goes, constructed this stone-colored brick building as his office complex in 1929 and then lost it in a divorce settlement to one of his actress-brides.

His menu at Republique presents a number of traditional Gallic pleasures: mussels and frites, escargot en croute, an Alsatian tart spread with bacon, raclette, and caramelized onions. But I wouldn\\'t label this restaurant as French.At this point hardly anything about the menu conjures \"French:\" It’s a wholly Californian mix of Mediterranean, American, and occasionally Asian flavors.  Intended or not, much of the food also comes straight from the Campanile playbook: flame-kissed proteins, of-the-moment salads, pasta tangled with seafood or filled with earthy purees. The most obvious parallel to the past is that Margarita Manzke, an exceptionally gifted pastry chef, sets up a daytime space to display her breads and pastries in the same wing of the restaurant where Silverton\\'s masterpieces once drew long lines.',\n",

Tiered seating allows for both people- and meat-watching. I spied two well-dressed women order, for their entrees alone, a collection of tiny steaks that would cost them, after tax and tip, nearly $400. And while my Wagyu strip — part of a $140 one-course tasting menu — was so gristly I had to leave it unfinished, that oversight of butchery didn’t quash the magic of it all.

Parts of the restaurant’s packed front room glow an eerie neon red, which is great if you like both your dining companion and your raw scallops to look like a photo negative in safelight. The bartender pours a lousy room-temperature red, and a sommelier does the same. A waiter brings out a glop of one-note macaroni and cheese and spoons it over my already-dirtied share plate.

As the cost of beef has turned ribeyes and strips, long a semi-affordable culinary luxury, into a veritable financial hardship, I’ve argued that rough-around-the-edges steakhouses will need to do a bit more to justify $100 plus per person tabs. Puck, accordingly, breaks out the decanters for even cheaper bottles of wine. A single order of chestnut soup is split into three separate bowls. The sound levels and space between tables are closer to a venue like Gabriel Kreuther than, say, Keens. About fifty percent of my meals began with excellent gougeres (I guess they forgot to bring them out the other times).

If a waiter substituted the Singapore menu for the New York one, nothing would make you say, \"wait a minute, wrong part of the world!,\" because Cut isn’t about sense of place. It is about expensive beef and everything that comes with it as a replicable, exportable, global commodity, just like the films of Puck’s beloved Hollywood.

It is a prima facie American indulgence. A steak dinner is never quite affordable, but it’s always approachable, a guaranteed way to spend about as much as you would on a tasting menu but with a third of the courses, none of the tableside speeches, and in half the time. And yet you’ll feel twice as awful afterward, which is precisely the point of such largess.',\n",

Almost every steak here is a study in the same degree of blandness. The steaks lack aromas of beefiness as much as they lack stronger overtones of stilton or offal. They are the bovine equivalents of chicken breast. The only noticeable difference between a dry-aged strip and a wet-aged ribeye is the price tag, and that the latter has more moisture. Only the grass-fed filet justifies its $50 price; the meat packs a gentle, natural acidity that tingles like a good Riesling.',\n",

That one exception, incidentally, is a two-ounce steak that comes as part of a $125 tasting of New York sirloin. It was, and I mean this as someone who loves Japanese Wagyu, objectively terrible.

After the dough rises, he adds the cheese, sauce, and toppings, and bakes the pizza in a gas-fired convection oven (which allows for more stable temperatures than wood) for about 10 minutes. A Neapolitan pie, by contrast, takes about 60 to 90 seconds. While the pizza bakes, all the oil at the bottom of the pan fries the dough – apologies, underskirt – imparting the pie with that golden crust. All this density and crispness is what lets the pie live a second life during takeout and delivery, rather than getting soggy, like a traditional Neapolitan pizza.',\n",

More subversive types like Roberta’s forged a more New York-influenced version of the Neapolitan pie, stiffening up the crusts, and throwing on anything and everything, from pastrami to blue cheese to honey to pickle juice.

If a classic Neapolitan pie is more like a filet mignon in its chew, Emily’s version is closer to a skirt steak: It tires the jaw just a hint more, but the payoff is more flavor in the crust, with just enough carbonized char to impart roundness and smokiness rather than bitterness.',\n",

Inevitably, the story behind the word or phrase is a red herring — something about a childhood turtle that ran away, a corgi that was flushed down the toilet, or an obscure street that was irrevocably altered when Robert Moses ruined the mom and pop ethos of a now condo-pocked neighborhood.

A restaurant’s name is its own narrative. A review, by contrast, is not the restaurant’s narrative. It is the critic’s narrative. It’s my narrative.',\n",

Those who find it a touch salty can order a $3 side of yogurt raita – though one can’t help but wonder whether these will evolve at some point into a cool ranch dipping sauce.

Downstairs, he went with the more affordable, a la carte Bread Bar (another great name), trafficking in potato apple chaat and – you guessed it – bacon naan.

       "  'It’s against this bourgeois backdrop that one considers Leuca. Restaurants, of course, are often studies in escapism, and Leuca delivers in that regard: It’s a Williamsburg restaurant pretending to be a stadium-sized spot in the Meatpacking District. I sip at a $14 spritz, served in what appears to be an opaque, fish-shaped flower vase and observe its largely windowless main room, filled with comfy brown banquettes, brown wood walls, brown wood floors, and four uncomfortably oversized photos of a little blonde girl making faces.',\n",
       "  'A waiter burdens our table with a few pounds of hot pork. This is the festa de maiale, a suckling pig whose skin is aggressively bronzed and whose somewhat unevenly cooked flesh is disappointingly under-salted. A pool of caper honey adds a touch of sweet zing to the musky flesh, but really, for $72 (this is the restaurant’s most expensive dish), you expect more careful cooking and seasoning. Large format dishes like this one make up half of the menu’s six mains; if you’re not dining alone, you can enjoy a $48 chicken for two (remember when chicken used to be a solo item?) and a $68 lamb, and if you’d like to bring the sharing ethos with you into the dessert course, an oversized riff on an affogato called the Sophia Loren.',\n",
       "  'Really, there’s not a whole lot to say about the food here, a sentiment that appears to be shared with whoever writes the menu: dish names occasionally lack any meaningful descriptions. That chicken for two, for example, is prepared \"rosalina\" style (this turns out to mean lemon and oregano). Lobster \"in purgatorio\" is a basic chile-and-butter topping for the crustacean; about par with a similar version I had at a restaurant I stumbled across in Washington back in 2002. And steak \"vesuvius\" takes the form of a New York strip topped with a cross between a salsa rosso and a romesco sauce; the garnish is a brilliant balance of heat, acid, and sugar, but the thin, under-charred, one-note beef diverts this interpretation of the Italian-American culinary experience through a detour at Applebee’s.',\n",
       "  'Carmellini loves to pair squid ink pasta with calamari. He’s served mind-bending riffs on that matchup at his other restaurants, sometimes adding a bit of chorizo or bacon jam for smoky, spicy overtones. But at Leuca, he pairs black shells and pedestrian calamari with a thin, sleepy tomato sauce. He also gives New Yorkers what might be our thousandth iteration of sea urchin spaghetti over the past twelve months, which would be fine it it were an improvement upon all the rest. Sadly, Lecua’s feels as if it were slicked with Elmer’s glue.',\n",
       "  'These are the type of pasta dishes that make you miss the compelling reliability of Locanda Verde or Bar Primi; in fact, Leuca as a whole makes you wish this was another outpost of the Dutch, Carmellini’s most Brooklyn-esque restaurant, which happens to be in Soho. There, Carmellini’s kitchen espouses a style of multiculturalism — a Latin-inflected take on tripe, Korean-inspired fried rice, matzoh ball soup, lamb neck mole, Caribbean goat pie — that still feels ahead of its time. Looking at the lay of the land in North Williamsburg, whose string of capable restaurants nevertheless feel somewhat monochromatic, and where there’s no shortage of Italian options, it’s hard not to wonder if the Dutch would’ve been a better fit. Alas, an Italian restaurant is what Carmellini — and his partners in the hotel — have given us.',\n",
       "  'The Sofia Loren, an oversized affogato',\n",
       "  'The good news, at least, is that Leuca throws together some pretty great dips, from a silky chickpea spread with bottarga (though the bottarga appears in name only, don’t expect much of its briny-sour tang) to a milky scoop of honey-topped ricotta. The raw tuna with green olives, chile, and crispy farro is serviceable, while the obligatory smoked beets taste like a phoned-in dish that couldn’t quite fit on the menu at Little Park, Carmellini’s lovely, vegetable-heavy hangout in lower Manhattan. The one don’t-miss dish is Leuca’s riff on Caesar salad: a mound of fire-roasted cabbage leaves, charred and then enlivened with lemon, parmesan and anchovy.',\n",
       "  'It’s also worth noting that my first bite of Carmellini’s pesto pasta among the best culinary experiences I’ve had over the past year. Just the first bite, though — the rest of the dish revealed itself to be strikingly unbalanced. The noodles are malfadini, long ruffled ribbons, cooked to an al dente density that almost feels like udon. The kitchen tosses the strands in a rapini pesto, twirls it all together in a bowl, and garnishes the verdant pasta with viridian sweet-and-sour peppers: all the colors of the Italian flag in a bowl. The first bite is truly stunning, a shock of bitter from the broccoli rabe offset by the sugars and acid of the peppers.',\n",
       "  \"But as you eat more, you’ll realize the sauce is a touch heavy, perhaps because the pasta isn't hot enough. And there aren’t quite enough peppers to include them in every bite, which means that the pesto’s bitterness starts to prevail, and the dish loses its footing. In the end, I found myself dredging the noodles through the remains of my starter of ricotta dip, though not voluntarily: Our server failed to change out the share plates between courses. (Service was generally impeccable over my five visits, but on this particular night, it took the staff about two courses to take and deliver a drink order)\",\n",

But for now, I’d advise patrons to skip Leuca’s generic dessert offerings, from the supermarket-bland chocolate pudding, to the $11 cheesecake that’s leaden as any version sold under glass at a neighborhood diner. If you want that family-sized Sophia Loren affogato, which runs nearly $20 after tax and tip, it’s reasonably tasty; the coffee-drenched sundae is loaded with assorted gelati, rum granita, caramel crumble, and meringue.

       "  'Mexican food enthusiasts generally agree that the country’s most exciting eats are found in Oaxaca. In this rugged land of scenic beauty in southernmost Mexico, indigenous Native American tribes like the Zapotecs and Mixtecs still make up a large part of the population. The cooking is exceedingly time-consuming, using ingredients like nuts, herbs, fruits, chocolate, and dried chiles to make complex sauces in earthen hues called moles, which often date to pre-Columbian times. The corn-based antojitos are different, too, including garnachas, tlayudas, tetelas, and tamales that come wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks. One taste of real Oaxacan fare and you’re hooked.',\n",
       "  'Unfortunately, New York City generally ignores the cuisine. While Los Angeles hosts such amazing Oaxacan restaurants as the traditional Guelaguetza, and the more innovative Mole De Los Dioses, plus over a dozen others, we have only La Morada in the Bronx, where the menu merely dabbles in Oaxacan food. Stray dishes are to be found at restaurants like Rosa Mexicano and Hecho en Dumbo, but even the taco chain that calls itself Oaxaca, without a trace of embarrassment, offers little authentic Oaxacan fare. Heck, even New Brunswick, NJ, boasts at least four Oaxacan restaurants.',\n",
       "  'Thus it was exciting to learn that a new Oaxacan spot had opened in January on Church Avenue in Kensington. Once a pizzeria, La Loba Cantina boasts two high-ceilinged rooms outfitted with small pedestal cerveza tables; tiled flooring in random patterns; a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe; paintings of blushing, bare-shouldered señioritas; a Spanish guitar begging to be strummed; with cacti and other xerophytic foliage in profusion. In short, the place really feels like a dusty cantina in southern Mexico. The bare-bones second room is devoted to an open kitchen, while a rear courtyard catapults you back into the world of Brooklyn tenements.',\n",
       "  'The dining room at La Loba Cantina',\n",
       "  'But one glance at the menu lets you know the place is more about mezcal — a smoky spirit associated with Oaxaca — than about food. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There are 50 varieties available in small and large shots, ranging in price from $6 to $30. Many come in picturesque pours, featuring gourds, crockery, citrus wedges, and spice-dusted wooden platforms. Really, if you escape the cantina without becoming tipsy from a couple of shots, you’re missing the point of La Loba (\"The She-Wolf\"). The drinks list also includes themed cocktails, beers, and a roster of tequilas, but more interesting are several obscure spirits, including herby sotol, fruity raicilla, and bacanora — a liquor smelling like pears that was bootlegged before 1992 legalization, as the menu tells us.',\n",
       "  'Inevitably, this alcoholic onslaught overshadows the food, much of which is nevertheless quite good. Foremost on the evening menu is the tlayuda, often referred to as a Mexican pizza. A large round of hand-patted masa is rubbed with refried black beans, then heaped with spring onions, avocado, cilantro, stringy white cheese, radishes, and tomatoes. The dish is exceedingly pretty, though La Loba’s rendition is too bland and greaseless. By contrast, the tlayudas in Oaxaca often come layered with gobs of raw lard and the funky jerky called tasajo. Of the four variations at La Loba, pick the house-made chorizo ($13), rather than the plain, chicken, or cactus.',\n",
       "  'Faring better are the Oaxacan tetelas (two for $7), folded masa triangles stuffed with beans and cheese, delicious when dipped in the accompanying brick-red salsa. Quesadillas ($9 to $11) are huge flops of folded-over masa dough, rather than the stateside bar snack of parallel flour tortillas glued together with cheese. In this case they’re stuffed with mushrooms, squash, chicken, or just cheese. One thing to skip is the ceviche, which features fish, pineapple, and jicama mounted on two small tostadas. The problem with the restaurant’s version is too little fish. Panuchos, featuring a blue fried-tortilla base, are topped with cochinita pibil, the pork stew that constitutes Yucatan’s gift to world cuisine.

This is the very spirit of southern Mexico expressed in a soup.

From the first twirled forkful, though, it's clear that Mark Ladner, Del Posto's executive chef, has transformed the classic dish from the inside out. He's a watchmaker who disassembled a Timex, and somehow rebuilt it into a Rolex.\",\n",
       "  \"Ladner uses langoustines — actual scampi — rather than the shrimp that have become an adaptive standard in this country. He blanches the lanky critters in broth with wine and aromatics, removes them in order to separate out the meat, and then chucks the shells back in the pot to reinforce the stock. Linguine, freshly pulled from boiling water, is tossed in this amped-up liquid, building an echo of briny sweetness between the pasta and the seafood. An emulsion of butter and olive oil varnishes the langoustine tail meat, which register as remarkably supple (but not at all mushy) against the al dente strands. The finishing accents of Calabrian chile flakes and Sorrento lemon from the Amalfi coast may be imported directly from Italy, but the scampi's righteous gusto and its melding with comforting noodles distinctly invoke the big-hearted spirit of Italian-American cooking.\",\n",
       "  'The effect is entirely by design. Del Posto is a restaurant whose name translates to of the place, and the sense of place in question spans continents.

The 11,000-square foot dining space has scores of seats to fill, as well as ferocious, continually evolving competition from which to set itself apart.\",\n",

They include fritters suffused with pecorino and black pepper — cacio e pepe, the dynamic flavor duo of the moment. One bite delivers the combination's umami jolt, and it's really all you need. The showstopper is a small teacup half-full of the most intense, concentrated chicken soup in the galaxy. Ladner and his crew spend three days and use 90 birds in succession, 30 at a time, producing this liquid. It arrives bobbing with a matzo ball-like dumpling made with corn flour, and a sip warms you like the blessings of a thousand grandmothers. It's a nod to the current popularity of Ashkenazi Jewish foods in America's restaurant culture, a testament to the universality of chicken soup, and an opening salvo announcing Ladner's mastery.\",\n",

The three-course lunch, formerly heralded as one of the city's great bargains at $29, has slid up to a still-reasonable $49.

Even dreamier are bauletti, larger bundles gushing sheep's milk ricotta and sauced in a brilliantly understated black truffle butter. (If you prefer your truffle flavoring more emphatic, start with the carne cruda, Ladner's aged-ribeye version of beef tartare.)

A gorgeously seared rib eye crowned with a charred onion salad came with a side of eggplant alla pizzaiola that turned out to be a tough, hardened puck.

In fact, the best deal on the menu is in a similar vein: milky mung bean jelly stacked like railroad ties, enhanced by crunchy peanuts ($6). It may be the spiciest vegan bowl in town.

Thus, scallion pancakes have been enlivened with shreds of seafood to good effect; on the negative side is a sweet-and-sour pork with chunks of pineapple that made me almost gag.

The presentations, too, constantly evoke the countryside: Unadorned vegetables or a veal bone filled with herbed beef heart arrive impaled on spiky instruments that resemble farm tools. A mini-trellis threaded with \"weeds\" appears alongside a planter of radiant tomatoes still on the vine. The accompaniments: tarragon pesto and garden shears.

Glasses of the liquid came halfway through the meal, paired with coppa — lush, striated shoulder meat from the farm’s 900-pound pigs — as a riff on the Italian classic of ham and melon. The kitchen selects the most fragrant cantaloupes, roasts and purees them, and then lets the juice slowly drip through cheesecloth overnight. Its taste hurled me back to my Maryland childhood, when my mother would buy cantaloupes from a man who grew produce and sold it from the back of his pickup truck in the summer.

One of three breads we tried was entirely whole wheat but feathery light; another was dense and molasses-like. All incredible. - BA. Wheat is one of his current preoccupations, and he’s been working with farmers in Seattle to grow a strain bred for flavor that also produces almost four times the yield of an average wheat crop.

       "  'One day, to establish a flavor baseline for the city’s hummus, I hopped on my bike and pedaled to several iconic spots. The weather was sweltering, the perfect time to test the creamy chickpea dip redolent of wind-whipped sands and the merciless desert sun. My first stop was Taïm, a small storefront just off Perry Street specializing in flavored falafels run by Israeli chef Einat Admony. Pooled with olive oil and rimmed with sumac, the hummus was liquid and salty and nutlike. It was tendered with a pita brushed with olive oil and za’atar that served as the perfect flavor foil. At historic Mamoun’s on MacDougal Street — where hummus was popularized in the ‘70s, becoming an instant hit with students, vegetarians, and bohos — the product was pastier and more richly flavored, tasting pungently of cumin, lemon, and garlic, though the cardboard pitas were a disappointment.',\n",
       "  'A short ride against traffic brought me to Hummus Place on 7th Avenue South just off Bleecker Street. Founded a decade ago in the East Village, it was one of the first places in town to suggest that hummus could be the centerpiece of an entire menu — an idea that Dizengoff was later to adopt. At Hummus Place the product flaunted its slippery texture and strong olive oil taste, but offered little else in the way of flavor thrills. Which brings us to the whole point of this round-up. Several times sitting at Dizengoff’s curving red counter I’ve heard customers exclaim, \"This is the best hummus I’ve ever tasted!\" And I wondered, \"Could it really be the best?\"',\n",
       "  'Located in one of the food court areas of the Chelsea Market, Dizengoff is a Philadelphia import, part of chef Michael Solomonov and business partner Steve Cook’s expanding restaurant empire there, which includes a sit-down Israeli restaurant, a Jewish Eastern European tapas joint, a doughnut and fried chicken carryout, a first Dizengoff, and, until a recent sale, an American-style barbecue. New York’s Dizengoff seats around 20 at a counter that undulates alongside a kitchen with a flaming metal oven. Above the counter are ranked cans of Israeli pickles. But the oven is the center of attention, and from it fly thick and lightly charred pitas that vie with the hummus as the most important part of the meal. They arrive steaming, packaged in formfitting paper bags.',\n",
       "  'Yes, it’s the best hummus in town. ',\n",
       "  'But how is the hummus? Elemental might be the best description. The flavor is limited to a single strong and lingering note: cumin. The texture is fluffy; almost unbelievably so. In fact, as you sit mopping it from the inside of your black plastic container with a torn fragment of pita, it threatens to detach itself and ascend to the ceiling. Yes, it’s the best hummus in town. In addition to the flatbread that comes alongside, you also get a chopped Israeli salad, a slender cucumber pickle or two, and some house-pickled onion swatches that, as the counter guy hastened to tell me one afternoon, \"should be used as alternate scoops for the hummus.\"',\n",

This is the responsibility of chef/partner Emily Seaman, who, in the early days of the Chelsea Market Dizengoff, was seen heroically pulling pitas from the oven. (When she’s not making them, they are sometimes not as good.) Five hummus variations priced from $10 to $13 are available, but part of the genius of the place is that the roster is always shifting, making a visit to Dizengoff a culinary adventure. Many, like tahini, fava beans, or a soft-boiled egg (which sometimes comes with potato chips) are entirely predictable.',\n",
       "  'Others that aren’t have included zucchini with hazelnuts, sliced avocado with peanut harissa, and romanesco — that green fractal vegetable in the cauliflower family — with toasted pine nuts. If you’ve gotten the idea that Dizengoff is a vegetarian joint with lots of vegan options, you’re right. But additionally offered is one meaty topping per day, at the highest price tier. In the early days it was lamb. Which was also a bit of a disappointment because it was lamb stew rather than a charcoal-grilled kebab, which is the more conventional accompaniment. Currently, the choice is coarsely ground chicken in red oil with Persian spices, which is beyond delicious. In fact, it’s my favorite topping of all those I’ve tried over the last four months.',\n",

There’s also a rotating selection of composed cold dishes, called salatim ($4 each, 3 for $11 with pita). These run from the exciting (matbucha, a braised tomato salad) to the not-so-exciting (stewed cabbage, wherein the vegetable was undercooked, making it a slog to eat).

Ippudo (ramen) and Tsurutontan (udon) are two examples, while chains like Ootoya (shopper’s cuisine) have shown a slower and steadier growth.',\n",

Yes, there have been import sushi chains here since at least the 1980s, when bargain-basement Genroku (long since closed) spun some rather uninspiring maki rolls around on a conveyor belt just north of the Empire State Building. On the other end of the cost spectrum, but also located on Fifth Avenue, Sushi Ginza Onodera opened its doors in May, slinging high-end, omakase-only meals. Somewhere in between lies Mi-Ne Sushi Totoya, which opened one month later with much less fanfare.',\n",

The sushi bar is plush, but the counter’s so high you can’t see what the chefs are doing to the fish. That fish is of exemplary freshness and offered at discount prices compared to restaurants of similar quality, undoubtedly due to the buying power of the chain. Most expensive is an omakase, coming in at $55 for 11 pieces of nigiri sushi and half a maki roll. In one instance that roll featured otoro (fatty tuna, the fanciest type), and the nigiri highlights included a plump scallop lightly seared and surmounted by a face of crunchy lotus root with two preserved-plum eyes; a slice of fatty fluke with a tiny dab of dilled mayo; and a piece of nicely cooked salt water eel.',\n",

This omakase constitutes too much food for one person, and it’s one of the best sushi deals in town. Other equally generous sushi and sushi/sashimi assortments are priced from $28 to $39.99.

As the website notes, \"It’s not really a seasonal food, but you can see a lot of temari-zushi in spring, around Girl’s Day (March 3rd) in Japan because temari-zushi is very colorful.\" Who knew?

Other menu items include tofu made with milk instead of soybean curd, and a broiled tuna collar ($19.99) so massive the restaurant asks it be shared among three or four diners. Miso-marinated black cod (a classic Nobu recipe) and two kinds of poké suggest the owners have carefully examined our city’s current restaurant scene before drafting their bill of fare.',\n",
       "  'This eclectic approach has its downside, too, especially in a page of maki rolls supposedly invented in America, which might be seen as confirmation of our own bad taste in sushi.

Maybe less deplorable is a black cod roll that puts the aforementioned broiled fish on top of a thick roll stuffed with avocado and pickles — one is well advised to pick the morsels of fish off the top and eat them separately.',\n",

They evoke a pre-tweezer past when Midtown was the hip part of town and adding cream made something fancy instead of fattening. The quenelle de brochet is endangered not because gilded-age institutions spin them out of rare fish but because the dish has slipped into stateside obscurity — along with the chefs who championed them in a pre-social media age.The quenelle is what makes restaurateur Stephen Starr's Le Coucou, in the 11 Howard Hotel in Soho, an unmistakable outlier. It is the rare restaurant less than forty years old to offer this laborious dish.\",\n",

Cooks place a single fist-sized quenelle in a gold-rimmed bowl and ladle it with more of the frothy, concentrated shellfish sauce. The quenelle, at Le Coucou, is a maritime marshmallow in a crustacean latte. It's a throwback dish that's somehow as avant garde as an edible green taffy helium balloon; Le Coucou, after all, has transformed a firm-fleshed fish into an edible cloud, a dish so light it's as if you're eating something that isn't there.

That's not because Le Coucou traffics in pastiche, but because it takes advantage of its black hole gravity —\\x80\\x94 and Starr's renowned devotion to Hollywood set design —\\x80\\x94 to wow New Yorkers with a few of the overlooked (or undervalued) culinary wonders of yesteryear. It's not a bad thing in an era where where newer restaurants are feeling increasingly uniform in their offerings.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a bromide to say what's old is new again, so let me put the wonders of Le Coucou in the following empirical context: It really is a commentary on the staid state of cooking in New York that one of the most refreshing piscine preparations I've had in quite some time is Rose's halibut in (the once ubiquitous) beurre blanc, the lean flaky fish elevated to heart-clogging bliss with enough emulsified butter and wine to cover the entire plate. Underneath the filet lies a mound of daikon sauerkraut: a tart, translucent not-quite-kimchi to wink at modernity before a diner drags it through all the fat.\",\n",
       "  'The caviar course is a staple of any grand French restaurant. This indulgence typically involves about 30 grams of fish roe over ice and starts at well over a hundred bucks. At Le Coucou, the barrier to entry is lowered in exchange for a smaller portion. Cost: $38 for a coral-colored pile of golden osetra atop veal tongue. The soft meat gently warms the firm roe, helping release its briny overtones, while the caviar in turn salts the delicately flavored tongue. It evokes an era when caviar was plentiful enough to season a dish, rather than being marketed as the star of a composition.',\n",
       "  \"Le Coucou is obvious in its luxuries: Lobster appears in three appetizers, foie gras in two, Wagyu in one. But their use isn't always obvious. The Wagyu is not steak, but rather tripe; it's been soaked, braised, fried, and laid over a brunoise of pickles and olives. Think of the crispy organ —\\x80\\x94 a style of stomach not uncommon in Lyon — as a fun French analogue to a Japanese pork tonkotsu.\",\n",
       "  'The wanton maxim \"to share,\" commonly deployed by restaurants to justify the $150 chicken, isn\\'t found on the Coucou menu, but perhaps it should be, as all of the fairly-priced mains are arguably portioned for two. Heck \"tout le lapin\" (all of the rabbit) could feed three. It\\'s a wild trio of gamy loin (drizzled with kidney vinaigrette), neutral hind legs cooked with mustard and onions, and restorative pot-au-feu for the nutty front legs.',\n",

You spoon a swath of aioli into the soup, dampening the littoral funk, but stinging the palate with garlic.',\n",

But throwbacks abound here, from a rice pudding like any other, to a rarely seen chiboust —\\x80\\x94 stiff pastry cream atop cherries —\\x80\\x94 to a vertical take on mousse, with infinite shavings of dark chocolate rising above the fluff like an accidental mille feuille of black truffles.',\n",

And it's the type of venue that will surely attract more to oldies like La Grenouille or more modern spots like Le Bernardin. Say what you will about 11 Howard (a $500/night Aby Rosen hotel that replaces a Holiday Inn) and what it symbolizes for the future of the city\\x80, but Le Coucou is the beating, albeit transplanted, heart of grand old French cuisine in New York right now.\",\n",

He eyeballs the binder leaf and shapes it down to size with a circular caveta knife. He adds filler leaves, rolls them up, snips off the wayward end with a table cutter, and places the aromatic cylinders in a wooden press for shaping. The finished products sit by the anteroom window like a pile of aromatically incendiary Lincoln Logs.

Guantanamera is a place to hang out without the constant pressure to order another $15 cocktail, though you'll certainly want to. It is a social club without the membership or the mafia.

As summer approached, the windows were flung open to the Lower East Side’s warm breezes and Gonzalez started experimenting with salads and savory dishes, eventually adding them to the menu.

Topped with pink pickled onions, its clash of colors knocked your socks off. An equally surprising salad featured chicharrones de harina (a pig-skin substitute), while a chia-seed pudding glowed red and white with pomegranate and freshly shaved coconut.

His trip to Mexico has paid off in cumin lamb barbacoa ($17), a rich red broth dotted with dark shreds of meat and creamy masa gnocchi — one of the chef’s most spectacular inventions.

       "  'In this cramped culinary era, a time when the de facto waiting room for a hot restaurant is often the empty restaurant next door, the smart people running Olmsted — where the bar, as it is at most restaurants, is filled with diners, not drinkers — have something a bit more comfortable and convenient in store: They send early arrivals to the backyard garden.',\n",
       "  'Walk through the restaurant and you\\'ll find yourself in a true backyard. Six outdoor benches are arranged in a large U shape around the perimeter, the type of seating plan that tasting menu spots construct around an open kitchen. (\"The cooks are the entertainment!\") Here, the benches are situated in a tiny urban farm. Patrons sit on fabric cushions, sipping orange wine and noshing on fried pickled fiddlehead ferns or puffy crawfish chips, watching fireflies glow a bioluminescent yellow. At Olmsted, the garden is theater. The raised beds around the benches are covered with a carpet of greenery so thick and soft it\\'s a wonder folks don\\'t try to slip the staff a $50, take off their shoes, and lie down amid the vegetation, a pastoral analogue to tipsilly wading through pool at The Four Seasons.',\n",
       "  'There are no tables out here; the garden is for snacks, cocktails, dessert, and sweating. It is 80 degrees on a summer night. A soft breeze blows through, and Japanese hand fans are scattered about for additional relief. A quail walks to and fro in a coop at the back of the yard. They\\'re kept for their eggs. \"We don\\'t slaughter them,\" a waiter reassures me, unprompted. I want to respond that I\\'d be okay with it if they did.',\n",
       "  'NY Grass-Fed Bavette (top); Watermelon Sushi',\n",
       "  \"In heat like this, it's tempting to invert the usual order of things and kick off an evening's festivities with something cool, something sweet, so I order dessert. A server ferries over a small ceramic bowl filled with white fluff adorned with flowers. Half of each spoonful is delicate, ethereal, honeyed, aromatized with lavender. This is whipped cream. The other half is cold, dense, and sour. This is frozen yogurt. The dish, as well-balanced as any of the more savory starters, is a monochromatic study in temperature and texture: It's nearly impossible to tell which of the two ingredients you're eating until it's actually in your mouth. It recalls Heston Blumenthal's iconic Hot Tea Cold Tea, a preparation where the two distinct beverage sit in a single glass with no barrier. Rarely in cuisine have cognitive dissonance and color been used in concert to such brilliant effect.\",\n",
       "  \"The garden, the wine, the great-tasting intellectualism — it's the type of outdoor epicurean bliss you might expect to encounter at one of the country's most expensive culinary establishments. And yet at Olmsted, a modest storefront restaurant in Brooklyn's well-heeled Prospect Heights, most dishes are under $20. Credit due to Greg Baxtrom, a chef who's spent time working at venues where $800 meals for two are not uncommon — Stone Barns, Atera, Alinea, Per Se — for giving New York one of its most paradoxically ambitious yet most approachable restaurants. After just three months in business, Olmsted easily joins the ranks of Estela and Wildair as one of the city's best and most creative small-plates places.\",\n",
       "  \"Olmsted's watermelon sushi, for example, is the type of nigiri Masa Takayama wished he were serving at his $598-a-head temple to raw fish. Baxtrom takes thin slices of Long Island fluke and paper-thin rounds of confit lemon, wraps both around pinky-sized sticks of the crimson melon, and finishes it all with fleur de sel. The sugars from the fruit, when mixed with the tart citrus and the high-end salt, electrify in the mouth; it's like a high end Sour Patch Kid.\",\n",
       "  'One of the secrets to that watermelon sushi is a thin layer of herb oil, infused with clippings from the restaurant\\'s garden. Ian Rothman, Baxtrom\\'s partner in the 50-seat endeavor, oversees the backyard farm, and if the food here wasn\\'t so good you\\'d roll your eyes at his bio. Rothman was the horticulturist at Atera, where (as Olmsted\\'s website explains), he \"oversaw the restaurant\\'s subterranean garden and living wall.\" All those who reckoned that a more pared-down spot like Olmsted might be deprived of its own living wall (let\\'s stop using that phrase): Fret not. Rothman has constructed a mosaic of green stuff that spans the length of the interior portion of the restaurant.',\n",
       "  \"The garden is in use during service, too: I watch a chef go out back to snip off some greens, perhaps a bit of lovage for the chawanmushi. The kitchen fries it up with spring garlic shoots and arranges the mixture atop of the delicate dish. With just a tap of your spoon they crackle and crunch like autumn leaves. Now take a bite: Summer truffles impart a whisper of woodsy funk, the garlic shocks the tongue with bitterness, and the soft, savory custard resets your palate with just a touch of sweetness. It's a $16 appetizer, but it wouldn't be out of place in a multi-hundred-dollar kaiseki menu.\",\n",

       "  \"Olmsted's backyard garden\",\n",
       "  '\"An affordable neighborhood restaurant is what we want,\" Baxtrom wrote to me via email. And while Olmsted\\'s pricing scheme accords with that statement, the caliber of food he\\'s serving makes things just a bit more complicated. Your typical neighborhood spot doesn\\'t command two hour waits on a Friday. The more accurate way to consider Olmsted might be as a destination local restaurant. It\\'s a venue that fills a need in the immediate community — Prospect Heights has plenty of casual weeknight spots, but no real history of haute cuisine — and yet it also ends up attracting a city-wide crowd — likely to be national, once word gets out.',\n",
       "  'A destination local restaurant presents a dilemma, as adulation and accolades (not to mention suddenly impossible-to-get-tables) tend to change a place. A prime example was the December 2007 issue of Bon Appetit: the powers that were decided to give the cover to the meatball sliders served at the Little Owl, an affordable West Village haunt that was already pretty packed every night. It was a seminal moment for small restaurants, many of whom had been living in the shadow of the Buddakan-style big box behemoths that arose in the late aughts, and a presager of the post-recession return to more intimate dining.',\n",
       "  \"Carrot Crepe (top); chef Greg Baxtrom at the pass; Olmsted's interior\",\n",
       "  \"In the end, the hordes came and went, and the Little Owl remained true to itself; it's more or less the same charming restaurant now as it was before its spotlight moment in 2006. But not all restaurants weather the attention so unchanged. When another destination neighborhood spot, NoLiTa's walk-in only Torrisi Italian Specialities, started to attract fans thanks to its affordable set menu, it slowly raised its price from $45 to $100, and then beyond. What began as a welcome antidote to fine dining became yet another expensive — albeit excellent — practitioner of the art.\",\n",
       "  \"None of this is to deny a good restaurant the chance to capitalize on its fame and evolve over the course of its lifespan. But in an era with so many operators pushing the tasting menu hard, it's heartwarming to see Olmsted take a more populist approach to ambitious gastronomy (Baxtrom tells me he has no plans to ever go prix-fixe only). It's also exciting to have another outer-borough pole holding up the city's high-end dining scene, which has spent the last decade spreading slowly (arguably too slowly) outward from Manhattan.\",\n",
       "  \"To put Olmsted's prices in perspective: A bottle of well-balanced orange wine runs $30 (a Manhattan venue could easily charge twice that). And the steak entree is $23 — a dollar more than a pizza at Franny's a few blocks away. That steak, by the way, is flawless: It's a grass-fed bavette that's silky as Japanese Wagyu; it delivers not a dry-age funk but an obscene beefiness. Baxtrom changes up the accompaniments depending on the season; when I dined there, he amped up the bovine factor with a tiny squash filled with a ratatouille that was a bit muskier than usual, thanks to a layer of beef short rib.\",\n",
       "  \"Fans of the atavistic appetizer-entree-dessert format might argue that Olmsted's servings are a touch small even by small plate standards. I'll counter that I've never tried anything here that isn't large enough to share. For a proper meal for two, you'll want to order about seven dishes — six shared savory plates, one dessert — plus a bottle of wine.\",\n",
       "  'One thing that should not be shared, however, is the carrot crepe. This is a preparation so fantastic it deserves to be enjoyed in full, on first and subsequent visits, without fear of having a companion steal a precious morsel.',\n",
       "  \"Olmsted's carrot crepe is not what it seems. It looks like a typically fussy salad, atop an orange disc dotted with flower petals. Then you rip through this decorative facade with your fork. Beneath lie soft little neck clams (or sometimes surf clams) and a rich yellow carrot jus infused with the flavor of the sea. Your palate is overwhelmed with butter and brine. Baxtrom has reimagined linguine with clams through the lens of a root vegetable, a French crepe, and the colors of a sunflower. It's stunning.\",\n",
       "  \"But as cutting edge as Olmsted is, it wouldn't be a proper 2016 restaurant if it didn't offer an agrodolce cauliflower, the current reigning version of which is gobi manchurian, a sino-subcontinental snack that involves turning the plant into a vegan riff on General Tso's chicken. Baxtrom goes more refined with an analogue called gobi pakoda; the fried romesco choufleur isn't drenched in neon goo, but rather sits adjacent a curried gastrique that's nearly as dark as a demi-glace. A candy-like sweetness hits you first, then a tamarind tang, then a wallop of heat from jalapeño.\",\n",
       "  'Scallops, the throwaway entree of the past 15 years (\"Maybe we should sear them?\") find a new relevance by being threaded on skewers and grilled over charcoal, with a wicked coating of deeply flavored pasilla chiles. Some of the mollusks are firm and cooked through, others are charred on the outside and enjoyably jiggly within; just when things threaten to get too salty, a mess of creamed corn, cooked in the style of risotto, resets the palate, its sweetness an early foreshadowing of dessert.',\n",
       "  \"Follow those up with the sublime steak or a roulade of guinea hen, at $24 the most expensive large plate, though good enough that I'd happily pay double that. The bird's gamy white meat is rolled around ramp mousse and roasted, sometimes creating the visual effect of a yin and yang when sliced. The sweeter, funkier thigh meat is doused under a swathe of foamy ramp hollandaise; searching for the morsels with a fork evokes a Michelin-starred riff on bobbing for apples. (Baxtrom says all the manipulation allows him to squeak out three instead out two portions out of each hen, helping him keep the price low.) Finish it up, then give up your table (if you like; there's no pressure from the elegant service team) to walk back outside for dessert. The meal ends where it begins, in near perfect bliss.\",\n",

       "  \"In fact, Vandal might be the best-trafficked new restaurant since Tao Downtown opened in 2013 —\\x80\\x94 which isn't too surprising, because it's run by the same people.\",\n",
       "  'Located on the Bowery, Vandal has 360 seats and can accommodate cocktail parties for a thousand guests, a fact that led me to believe, incorrectly, that I could walk in at 8:30 on a Friday evening. \"We have nothing until midnight,\" the host said. That can\\'t be true, I thought, and so a week or so later I checked day-ahead bookings for Saturday in the early evening. Result: OpenTable showed me availability for tables ranging from 12:00 a.m. to 12:45 a.m. Technically, that\\'s Sunday.',\n",
       "  \"Process that for a second. Then consider this: It's easier to get a prime time reservation at the twelve-seat Semilla, one of the most celebrated and ambitious new restaurants of the past two years, than it is at Vandal, a 22,000 square foot space specializing in mini-ramen, mini-burgers, mini-knishes, and an assortment of ostensibly edible things that have been fried into balls. You could fit the entirety of Semilla into the men's room at Vandal and still have space left over.\",\n",

Every cocktail server wears a sleeveless, often very tight vest, so that when she leans over to take your order you look in the other direction to avoid looking like a creep. Every geisha depicted in the paintings throughout the room is in a stage of undress. Every male waiter wears regular clothes.',\n",

(For that last one, part of the proceeds from sales go to autism awareness. Why not?) It all comes courtesy of Chris Santos, the chef famous for kitsching it up at Stanton Social with his French onion soup dumplings and tuna poke wontons.',\n",
       "  \"Here's a snapshot from a recent meal at Vandal: A waiter ferries over a bottle of beer with an empty glass, and leaves. I pour it myself, and the head overflows onto my share plate. Another waiter arrives with the chicken Caesar pizza, which looks like what you'd expect if a cook emptied a bottle of parmesan dressing onto a pallid spa cracker, applied a squeeze bottle swirl of romaine pesto, and let the musky crumbs from a pre-shift meal of KFC waft down over that pizza. It is profoundly awful. I consume it without setting it down between bites, because that would mean getting it all soggy from that beer puddle in front of me, which also contains the floating detritus of a half-consumed reuben sandwich knish from an earlier round.\",\n",

Speaking about the closure of Elaine\\'s, the erstwhile high-society hangout on Manhattan\\'s Upper East Side, Woody Allen had said, \"Despite the unrelenting bad food I went there every night for decades ... My theory was that if the food had been better, people would have gone only to eat. But keeping the food at a certain low level, everybody went for conversation and meeting people and chatting, and that was the success of the place.\"',\n",
       "  \"Vandal is not the moneyed literary salon that Elaine's once was. It attracts a different crowd. Glittery people with last names like Hilton, Kennedy, Matisse, Kardashian, and Strahan have all partied here, under the faux-decanter light fixtures. Regular readers of the gossip pages know that the velvet-roped downstairs lounge has featured the spinning of society model/DJs like Hannah Bronfman.\",\n",
       "  \"The restaurants in the Tao Group, run by Marc Packer, Richard Wolf, Noah Tepperberg, and Jason Strauss, aren't so much purveyors of food as they are adult theme parks selling manufactured fun, and proximity to vaguely famous people. These spots traffic in a more expansive style of consumption than one that's strictly gustatory in nature. Years before Carbone sold the experience of pairing $65 chicken parm with Jersey-accented waiters who sing on Saturday nights, the Tao Group's blockbuster Lavo hawked spaghetti with Kobe meatballs while the club downstairs hosted bikini brunches.\",\n",
       "  'Then there is the Tao juggernaut itself, a trio of hot spots in Midtown, West Chelsea, and Las Vegas, where the diverse foodways of the global East are diluted down to overpriced Red Bull, wontons, and Wagyu. Tao sells \"Asia,\" a bro-friendly bacchanalia where everyone is fluent in the universal language of loosened ties. I\\'ll take two Grey Goose sodas... no, make that three! The food ranges from awful to passable, but I\\'ve found that sitting on Tao\\'s candlelit staircase while overlooking the 24-armed Buddha statue is as surefire a way to impress one sort of date as cocktails at Bemelmans is another. Really, where else can New York diners pay gustatory tribute to the life of the humble Siddhartha in a way that would make both Lil Wayne and Michael Bay proud?',\n",
       "  'Just in case you have any illusions on the popularity of these venues, the three Tao restaurants plus two Lavos are five of the top-grossing independent restaurants in the U.S.; in 2015 they reportedly pulled in $156 million collectively, 44 percent more than what it cost Ridley Scott to make The Martian.',\n",
       "  'This all brings us back to Vandal. Its size, prices, and population density seem likely to earn it a few dollars of its own. And it has its own approach to storytelling fun. Here\\'s the Tao Group website with the formal narrative: \"Located on Bowery, a street that dates back to the 17th century ... Vandal celebrates the art, architecture, and food of global street culture from New York to Vietnam to Barcelona and beyonddfsdfsd [sic].\"',\n",
       "  \"Their web editor might have fallen asleep at the keyboard, but that part about art and architecture is true. There's a certain aesthetic joy that one experiences in taking in the restaurant's graffiti, murals, and sculptures, from Hush's wall-sized naked geishas to the Rockwell Group's giant sculpture of a breakdancing purple rabbit, to Shepard Fairey's Soviet-style billboard prints in the Garden Room.\",\n",
       "  \"The space is fascinating enough that if Vandal simply served competent brasserie fare, the entire endeavor would be somewhat civilized, a place for the cool kids to congregate and look at art.

       "  \"Vandal's giant bunny, left; octopus huaraches\",\n",
       "  \"This is a good time to talk about Vandal's banh mi'eatball slider. The name of the dish is a portmanteau of three trendy foodstuffs: the banh mi, a Vietnamese sandwich of pate, pork, pickled carrots and chiles; the slider, a tiny White Castle-style burger; and the meatball, an Italian-American symbol of thrift. Now here's what you actually get: a single dense ball of spiced ground lamb, sandwiched within a slaw-stuffed baguette. The menu says the dish includes foie gras, none of which I detected. This two-bite travesty costs $8, which is more than what you ought to ever pay for an entire banh mi, a single meatball, or a solitary slider.\",\n",
       "  \"Vandal doesn't want its food to be bad. If it did it wouldn't have hired Santos, of Stanton Social as well as Beauty & Essex, one of the least worst Tao Group restaurants. (The venue famously pours free sparkling rose in the ladies' room. Depending on your point of view, it's either generous or insidious.) Santos' food has always trended somewhat gimmicky, but during my meals at Beauty & Essex when it opened half a decade ago, I remember a chef serving delicious, ambitious fare, from a solid lamb burger to a Wagyu carpaccio dusted with seaweed, amping up the umami of the beef.\",\n",
       "  'At Vandal, Santos smears beef tartare over a hot pretzel, resulting in hot mush. The menu is \"inspired by street fare from around the world,\" the restaurant\\'s website asserts, a statement that raises the question of what precisely is \"street\" about a two-pound lobster scampi that costs $68.',\n",
       "  \"Inspiration, of course, doesn't mean replication. And there's nothing wrong with luxing up cheap eats. But the source has to be believable. And when it comes to elevating the price, the actual culinary art of refining such fare should play as much a role in the calculus as the tax on eating it in a chic, high-rent location. This gets to the heart of why Vandal doesn't quite work: The Tao Group sells a story about global street fare, but fails to deliver on that story.\",\n",
       "  'Take the fish tacos. Vandal takes an small amount of (expertly cooked) Chilean sea bass and overwhelms the delicate fish with a mess of slaw. Cost: $24 for three tacos. Consider the rice balls. Vandal calls the under-seasoned creations \"cacio e pepe arancini,\" and uses a side of parmesan dipping foam to command a $15 price. How about paella? It\\'s not really street food, but that\\'s the least of Vandal\\'s problems. The dish contains no soccarat - the life-alteringly wonderful crust of rice that forms at the bottom and edges of the pan, packing in all sorts of complex flavors —\\x80\\x94 instead, it\\'s just mushy rice with chorizo and chicken.',\n",
       "  \"A modicum of credit is due for the adventurous spirit, though. Most sceney establishments pooh-pooh trendy fare in favor of tried-and-true classics, but Santos's kitchen embraces modern food culture, their menu riffing on the sort of thing Anthony Bourdain and crew will likely show off in their giant West Side food hall opening up next year. Sometimes it really works: Dishes like glutinous rice cakes or octopus huaraches are absolutely brilliant; the former act as a pleasant conduit for a spicy broth, while the latter is all soft cephalopod and pure corn bliss. Even the mini-ramen, a small bowl for $9, packs firm noodles and a wallop of smoky, bacon-laced dashi.\",\n",
       "  \"But when dollar churros cost $16, it's hard not to be a little cynical, to wonder whether Santos and the Tao Group really think of Vandal as a restaurant, or as a forum to poke fun at modern gastronomy, a chance turn their guests into unwitting participants in a parody on what it means to eat out in 2016. Or maybe it's just a machine to make money. Whatever the intention, Vandal will continue to draw in the crowds.\",\n",

       "  'Really, twelve dollars for broth?\" my companion asked as we looked over the menu at Hearth, Marco Canora\\'s twelve-year-old restaurant in the East Village. In 2016, the determination of value when it comes to a restaurant dish is indeed a complicated affair. But can a person really put a price on a miracle elixir?',\n",
       "  'In his ossiferous opus Brodo: A Bone Broth Cookbook, Canora writes about broth the way some epidemiologists write about the polio vaccine. He reverently describes how his savory potions of bones and spices brings joint relief to arthritis sufferers. He explains that the hot, marrow-laced liquid helped him become a calmer, more peaceful man, thanks in part to the \"gut-brain connection.\" Take or leave these psychological, biological, and religious claims, but lord in heaven, that brodo is Hearth\\'s best dish, and I\\'ll pay whatever Canora asks for it.',\n",
       "  \"It starts with turkey, chicken, and beef bones, which have the shinola boiled out of them until they've fully disintegrated. Canora then adds turmeric, black pepper, and marrow, and ladles your serving into a aqua ceramic bowl, which you're instructed to pick up with your hands and drink from directly. The bronze-brown liquid smells of dry-aged beef. The collagen makes your lips stick together. The peppers warm your throat. It doesn't exactly whet the palate; rather, it snaps the senses back into focus after the dulling effect of the short walk in 10-degree windchill that brought you to the restaurant's door. This is, ideally, how you begin every meal at this brick-lined, dimly-lit neighborhood gem. It is transportive.\",\n",
       "  'But not too transportive. Coming back to life, aided by this rich broth, you see Momofuku overlord David Chang sitting in a corner booth; he\\'s eating butter-drenched gnocchi perfumed with sage leaves. You hear the late, great Ol\\' Dirty Bastard crooning on the sound system: \"Ooh baby, I like it raw.\" And you realize you\\'re here, in the East Village. You are at Hearth, a restaurant that is as awesome as it\\'s ever been, even though it is, as of two months ago, an entirely different restaurant.',\n",
       "  \"Cured pork belly with marinated fennel (left); Hearth's updated interior\",\n",
       "  'Hearth opened in 2003 as a partnership between Marco Canora, the opening chef de cuisine at Craft, and Paul Greico, the goateed former wine director of Gramercy Tavern. (Greico left in 2014.) The cuisine was seasonal, Tuscan-inspired American fare, with intricate charcuterie boards, hearty ribollitas, earthy mushrooms, filling bollito mistos, and lush ribeyes for two.',\n",
       "  \"Things were great. Until they weren't. Over the years, Canora saw his rent rise by 65 percent. He was overweight. He was diagnosed with gout. And as guests who've sat at his chef's counter can attest, when things didn't go right in the kitchen, he occasionally did his best impression of Gordon Ramsay, shouting and cursing at underperforming cooks.\",\n",
       "  'But according to Canora (who has recognized me on every single visit I\\'ve made to his restaurant), he managed to turn his health around, curb his temper, and keep his business afloat, thanks to — well, thanks to soup. He started hawking the stuff (he calls it \"brodo,\" a nod to Hearth\\'s Italian influences, though it\\'s more commonly identifiable as bone broth) out of one of the restaurant\\'s window in 2014. The Today Show aired a segment. Epicurious called it the new coffee. The New York Times compared it to the other haute addictions du jour, coconut water and green juice. People came in droves.',\n",
       "  'Then in early 2016, Canora closed Hearth for a week, nixed traditional appetizers and entrees on the menu in favor of au-courant share plates, expanded the offerings to better reflect the healthful, nutrient-dense ethos of his beloved brodo and, in the end, debuted a slightly more comfortable room to match the resulting slightly higher cost of dining.',\n",
       "  'This isn\\'t a \"they replaced Shea Stadium with Citi Field\" renovation. Changes are subtle. Only regular guests of the old Hearth will notice the changes. The bar up front, formerly slate, is now jade marble, and the chef\\'s counter is now butcher\\'s block (I\\'d happily sleep on both). There\\'s a long, soft leather banquette along the north wall, and the old rust-red ceiling is now painted an airy white. The pendant lamps might be new, but the lighting is still gentle enough to flatter your paper-thin radishes served over buttermilk, the gentle fats of the dairy softening the spice of the kaleidoscopic roots.',\n",
       "  'Canora has long championed a narrative of enlightened gastronomy. Bar coasters at the original Hearth were emblazoned with Depression-era government mantras: \"Save what will keep, eat what will spoil.\" At Hearth reborn, Canora doubles down on that ethos. The back of the menu is printed with a 13-section mission statement that touts a ban on \"lions of the sea\" (swordfish, for example, is off the bill of fare); pledges support for the local greenmarket over the allure of \"certified organic\"; champions fresh fats (\"we change our fryer oil every day\"); and encourages everyone to eat offal, by way of a cute little story about a cheetah slaughtering a gazelle for its bloody organs.',\n",
       "  '\"In the simplest terms, we only use meat from happy, healthy animals,\" reads the menu, a statement that would come across as a bromide if not for a more compelling truth that Canora doesn\\'t publicize: The chef doesn\\'t like how many young calves are weaned on powdered milk, and so Hearth has, for the time being, eliminated veal from what might be its most famous dish, the ethereal ricotta meatballs, which are now made with beef.',\n",
       "  'Another rule: \"We mill our own flour and polenta from intact, non-GMO, heirloom varieties.\" Canora, true to form, puts his money where his mouth is. He cracks his own rye berries for for a red-cabbage-topped porridge (he calls it \"risotto\") that boasts the the texture of coarse polenta and that explodes with the flavor of caraway seeds. He grinds whole grain for toothsome homemade rigatoni, dressed with a pork ragu whose deep flavors linger like mole. And he breaks down buckwheat for pizzoccheri - short, earthy tagliatelle that stand up to stinky, stretchy fontina and heady mushrooms better than standard-issue semolina pasta ever could.',\n",
       "  \"Hearth still sells its famous gnocchi, which dissolve in the mouth with all the ease of pommes purée. Just one tweak: Canora switched to a local, small-production outlet for his all-purpose flour. And the butter coating those gnocchi, like all of the restaurant's cooking butter, comes from grass-fed cows, a pricey product that elsewhere might only be reserved for formal bread and butter. These under-the-hood changes contribute to the moral integrity of the revamped restaurant, and they also have a noticeable impact on a salient part of the Hearth experience: dining here now, you'll likely spend more than you would have last year.\",\n",
       "  'Spanish mackerel with cipollini onions, potatoes, and shellfish cream (left); the Variety Burger',\n",
       "  \"No, the old iteration of Hearth wasn't cheap, but the new version is downright expensive. Small plates add up, and it's likely that a proper dinner for two will exceed $100 per person after tax and tip. But it's worth it; the price is in line with the high quality of the food that Canora and his chef de cuisine, Luigi Petrocelli, are sending out. (The better deal, for those willing to give up a bit of control, is the six-course, $78 tasting, drawn from the a la carte menu.)\",\n",
       "  \"Still, some of Hearth's portions are tiny even by small plates standards. A crispy-skinned cod square served with kale is, improbably, as indulgent as collards with ham hocks, but you're paying $26 for a fillet that's not much bigger than a deck of playing cards. Mackerel, illogically served in a bowl (please don't serve things that need to be cut in bowls), with an almost invisible layer of shellfish cream, delivers about three flawless bites of deliciously oily flesh for $21. Better bang for your small-plate buck comes in the form of pork belly, shaved like carpaccio under a rainforest canopy of fennel. It's a modestly sized plate, and with good reason: too much more of this salty, herbaceous bliss and the palate would go utterly dead.\",\n",
       "  'Among the heartier portions are the pastas and grains, including the very good bread service, which is no longer complimentary, nor should it be. Three large slices of Sullivan Street sourdough arrive with a trio of dips: grassy butter, fruity extra virgin olive oil, and smoky whipped lardo from, to borrow Canora\\'s words, \"good clean pigs.\" A generous portion of carrot and beet tartare never seems to end, perhaps because the bland creation doesn\\'t pack the same complexity as the foie gras or trout roe-laced versions at Little Park or Semilla. Instead, try the tart grilled cauliflower over a mash of smoked, shredded trout, a functional one-plate meal for $16.',\n",
       "  'But the king of Hearth is cow. There are no traditional steaks on the menu, so you get your bovine fix from a few weighty slices of beef neck. The meat is braised, but the cow\\'s grass-feeding (and barley finishing) means the lean cut has a heft that\\'s closer to a firm filet mignon than it is to the short rib of a more conventional corn-fed steer. The flavor is concentrated, and doubly so when you drink the clear \"sauce,\" which isn\\'t a reduced braising liquid but rather — there it is again — Canora\\'s beef brodo.',\n",
       "  'And then there\\'s the burger. So often, the burger is the most middle-of-the-road item on a menu. Here, it\\'s among the most challenging offerings. The \"Variety Burger\" is a medium-rare patty made from a coarse grind of brisket, chuck, heart, and liver. It\\'s served with sweet potato wedge fries (heresy!) and without a bun (hiss!). The lack of bread means there\\'s nothing but a slice of melted fontina and a heap of caramelized onions to soften the organ meats\\' clean, ferric blow. It is, without a doubt, the biggest risk a New York chef has taken with a hamburger since Daniel Boulud stuffed one with foie gras and truffles over a decade ago, and it\\'s easily one of the standout dishes of the year.',\n",
       "  \"Desserts, from fried apple donuts to the dark chocolate board (which feels like a gourmet market raid), are great, but they don't wow the same way the brodo or burger does. And it's hard not to feel a swell of nostalgia for Grieco's wacky, annotated wine list and its epic Riesling selections. (There are still tons of Rieslings on offer, though only one by the glass.) Still. Canora deserves credit not just for turning his health around, but for keeping a neighborhood mainstay open and relevant in a city that eats up and spits out so many young venues a year in — let alone a dozen. I'll raise a cup of hot broth to that.\",\n",

Considered the national dish of Brazil, it’s really more of a set meal of several components, providing an explosion of colors and flavors. Sure, feijoada originated in Portugal, and each former colony from Mozambique to Macau has its own version, but never has it been carried to such heights as in Brazil, and rarely has New York seen such a lush rendition.',\n",

Some meats are smoked, some fatty, some fibrous, and others you simply won’t be able to identify, though if you dredge up a curly morsel, it’s probably pig tail. Crumbly? Blood sausage. The superiority of Brazil’s feijoada derives from its African influences, which perfectly complement the European ones.',\n",

Via Brasil is the best of the eateries, decorated with an old-fashioned opulence that includes swirling stone tiles in the front barroom, a white piano for Brazilian jazz performances, a profusion of parrots, and leather banquettes that trail into the stained-wood interior, where Brazilian expat families survey the scene, whispering in Portuguese.',\n",

The single serving of feijoada ($27) feeds two, while the portion for two ($34), would do fine for three. Dating from the days when there were no churrascarias in town, Via Brasil also provides a menu of grilled meats, of which the assortment called Rio Grande delivers chicken pieces, a thick pork chop, a sirloin steak, and a smoke-laced sausage. At $27, there’s no better meat deal in town.',\n",

Take hoppers, for example. One order consists of five pale pancakes that form perfect hollow hemispheres. For no apparent reason, one of the five has an egg cracked in the bottom, runny yolk intact. These curvilinear flatbreads made from rice flour and coconut milk are leavened with microorganisms that descend from the air, yeast, or sometimes toddy, a palm-based wine . The hoppers are crisp and creamy, and at San Rasa, you get to pick a bowl of curry to dip them in: beef, chicken, fish, lamb, shrimp, squid, or vegetable ($12 to $15).',\n",
       "  'San Rasa is one of at least six restaurants in Staten Island that represent the cooking of the Sri Lankan community there, which numbers around 5,000, mainly located in the St. George/Tompkinsville/ Stapleton neighborhoods, a pleasant 15-minute walk from the ferry terminal. The deep dining room is accented with paintings of ancient ruins, Hindu and Buddhist sculptures, and swooping wooden ceiling buttresses and beams that one fellow diner exclaimed, \"look like they came from a pre-fab kit to build a beach cabana.\" A (liquor-less) bar flanks one side of the room, and a brick-lined nook at the rear provides a staging area for the Sunday all-you-can-eat buffet ($11.99).',\n",

Exceedingly rich and flavorsome, the dark gravy provides the perfect dip for torn pieces of flatbread. Another nice selection is ambul tiyal, a tart fish curry. The recipe involves lime juice, chiles, ginger, and other flavorings; as with sushi, it originated as a method of fish preservation. Less satisfying in this context is San Rasa\\'s plain chicken curry, which is a little too low on zing to complement the bland hoppers.

Here, shrimp or mixed vegetable curries are the ones to pick, making the pyramid as mellow as a Middle Eastern fattoush. Perhaps the most curious Sri Lankan starch of all is pittu: a ghostly white cylinder wrapped in a glistening banana leaf.

       "  \"A food writer who hates too hard on brunch —\\x80\\x94 that weekly Champagne and syrup-soaked portmanteau of a meal — is like a middle-aged music critic berating the teens to quit watching Taylor Swift videos on YouTube and invest in a Led Zepplin boxed set instead. Categorical brunch anathema, I've come to accept, is a surefire path to irrelevance.\",\n",
       "  \"Say what you will about the indignities of cheesecake-stuffed French toast, but to humans who don't habitually eat out on weeknights, take 90-minute lunch breaks, or have time for leisurely, sit-down breakfasts, brunch is often the most accessible way to interact with a restaurant. It's a weekly-meal analogue, of sorts, to Restaurant Week: For a cynical chef, brunch is an opportunity to rip off unsuspecting patrons, but for smart operators, it's a gateway drug to to show off the wonders of their culinary establishment at a lower price, and an easier point of entry.\",\n",
       "  'Eli Kulp is one of the smart operators. His bread-and-pastry-centric West Village restaurant, High Street on Hudson (a spinoff of his Philadelphia original, High Street on Market), belongs to a rare class of venues where the rustic pleasures of weekend brunch can equal the refined options of dinner.',\n",
       "  'From top: Red-eye danish; seaweed linguine; the interior of High Street on Hudson.',\n",
       "  \"Consider the redeye pastry. It begins with a tiny danish filled with coffee-spiked cream —\\x80\\x94 alone, this would be a magnificent snack, but High Street's in-house bakers up the ante, garnishing it with country ham that's ruffled like an ornamental porcine flower. And the finish? A dusting of parmesan, like powdered sugar. So there you go, all the components of a proper European breakfast, minus the cigarettes, with a nod to the American south. The resulting combination of textures and sweet-savory flavors — caffeinated cream, musky pork, chewy dough, and MSG-esque fromage — is one of the city's best new pastries.\",\n",
       "  'I\\'m not the first person to discover the joy of High Street in the morning. \"We\\'ve actually closed the wait list for brunch,\" a host tells me an hour before the end of midday service one weekend. The following week, just after 11:00am, a line snakes out the door. Outside, ten aspirants, plus a baby in a stroller and a black labrador, wait for the host to text with good news. I overhear one of their conversations: \"Is avocado toast a thing in Canada?\"',\n",
       "  \"Inside, natural light pours through giant windows overlooking Hudson and Horatio streets. Everything is wood and hard surfaces: white floors, brown tables, black chairs, and the type of too-shiny-to-be-real open kitchen that one might encounter anchoring a Williams-Sonoma outpost. It's all a recipe for high noise levels, but keeping the sound level in check are high ceilings and a soft fabric art installation — a burlap rendering of Manhattan that doubles as a nice head rest for those of us sitting against it.\",\n",
       "  \"Do yourself a favor and order from the A-list of egg-on-a-roll sandwiches, which include the Hickorytown — a sweet mess of fried bologna, frizzled onions, and gherkin mayo — or the Pastrami & Hash — a perfect geological cross section of stretchy crimson meat, soft brown potatoes, fluffy yellow eggs and a verdant jalapeño puree that's tangy then spicy. Spillage, even without a wax paper wrap, is minimal.\",\n",
       "  \"Or try the Meatpacker, a stunner of a $16 platter that includes a pile of funky, spicy coppa, soft broccoli rabe, two eggs any way, Old Bay potatoes (nuclear-sized chunks that taste of the Chesapeake), and, best of all, homemade malt sausage, a meat whose soft mouthfeel, pink hue, and livery aftertaste evokes a cross between Canadian bacon and scrapple. It is without question, one of New York's finest carnivorous options, and the platter itself rivals an English breakfast in its calorie content and deliciousness factor.\",\n",
       "  'Kulp took an unconventional approach to opening his New York restaurant. Rather than kicking off with dinner and then waiting for the reviews to pour in, the venue debuted with breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and then added on nighttime hours a month later. High Street, in other words, was almost instantly an all-day brasserie, a risky move for such a young venue.',\n",
       "  \"Of course, staying open throughout the day can help any young restaurant meet its financial obligations more quickly. At least, theoretically. The downside can be enormous: higher labor costs if guests don't show up (there's no captive hotel audience here), greater opportunity for errors amid the increased offerings, and a staff that will almost surely be overworked, no matter how deep the bench of cooks and waiters.\",\n",
       "  \"And yet, High Street pulls off the all-day experience with aplomb. No, the 60-seat spot doesn't quite have the space (or the wifi) to act as a true third space between home and work, the type of venue like Lafayette or the lobby at the Ace where four-tops can drop by for coffee only and end up spending an entire Saturday afternoon typing away on their MacBooks. But you can usually snag a stool behind High Street host stand and spend an hour or two during a slow lunch sipping a cortado and reading the paper. And for those who are skeptical about the usefulness of an institution where the brunch waits can exceed an hour, consider this: a dedicated takeout counter gets patrons in and out in under 10 minutes, even during peak hours. Not even a busy bodega can always accomplish such speed.\",\n",
       "  'The \"daily breads and spreads\" platter',\n",
       "  \"So if the queue drags on, pick up a cinnamon raisin bagel to go, saunter over to the High Line (a three-minute walk), and enjoy the super-chewy, naturally leavened treat on a bench while gazing out over the Hudson. In fact, that's where I ate half of High Street's stunning gabagool sandwich, an old school pairing of salami, iceberg lettuce, stinky provolone, spicy peppers, and musky pork shoulder, a gorgeous salt bomb of cold cuts on a soft a sesame hero.\",\n",
       "  \"The sandwich lineup can be hit or miss, with its dodgy roast pork and frankly terrible pastrami on rye, with cold, blubbery meat and an incongruous smear of cole slaw. But then there's the excellent, if incorrectly named, Bodega Sandwich: eggs, cheese, and malt sausage on a biscuit. (The proper New York bodega sandwich comes, of course, on a roll.) Another clutch choice is the sliced turkey: The kitchen cooks the fowl so gently and cuts it so thin it practically dissolves in your mouth like pâté. Is it as compelling as the original honey-marinated version from Torrisi Italian Specialties, where Kulp worked as chef de cuisine for years? It sure comes close.\",\n",
       "  \"As the afternoon sun dims and High Street switches to dinner, attention in the restaurant turns away from the sumptuous windows and back toward the room itself. This is when a diner might notice that there's an extra-wide path between the tables, leading from the front door back to the kitchen. A man in a motorized wheelchair and a baseball cap hangs out near the chefs. Later on in the evening he rides down toward the front of the house and greets guests.\",\n",
       "  'This is Eli Kulp. Last May, the six-foot-four chef was en route to New York via Amtrak 188, the passenger train that derailed at Frankford Junction in Philadelphia, killing eight on board and injuring 200. The derailment sent Kulp airborne, and he hit the luggage rack with his neck, leaving him without the use of his legs and with limited mobility in his hands.',\n",

       "  \"Kulp's imprimatur is everywhere in the restaurant, though culinary director Jon Nodler and chef de cuisine Taylor Naples does most of the cooking. But remember this name: Alex Bois. Bois does the baking, overseeing what truly sets the restaurant apart from the competition: the bread, both by itself — the High Street style is an armor-like crust and a moist, almost under-baked crumb — and as an integrated aspect of the larger culinary operation. Such a dedication to the craft of leavening is a true luxury in this era, when so many in-house bakery and pastry programs have been on the chopping block, an easy operation to cut in the face of rising costs.\",\n",
       "  \"On Saturday, a bowl of samples sits on the takeout counter; they're cubes of anadama bread, a New England-style deli loaf forged from cornmeal and molasses. At dinner, that same bread appears as toast, a crispy conduit (and foil) for the rich oils of barbecued eel.\",\n",
       "  \"Brunch guests smear malted butter (imagine the caramel overtones of dulce de leche, minus the sweetness) atop slices of nutty, caraway-packed rye. Breakfast patrons use sunny-side-up eggs as dipping receptacles for a potato bread so ethereal it's as if Bois knows how to transform meringue into a complex carbohydrate. And upon leaving, smart diners will indulge in the ultimate take-home treat: a cherry-buckwheat loaf whose fruit tames the intense earthiness of the dark cereal grain.\",\n",
       "  \"You could, of course, simply order the $8 bread board for your dinner, and make a light meal of it, but that would mean overlooking the kitchen's more ambitious fare. Kulp might've created the tripe dish of the century, brining cow stomach for 48 hours before frying it, cutting it into strips, tossing it with guajillo peppers and sriracha, and finally finishing the whole thing over charcoal. The finger-friendly starter boasts the crunch and heat of hot wings, as well as the satisfying chew of warm beef jerky, the sort of thing that wouldn't be out of place at a Super Bowl party.\",\n",
       "  'Pastas are a smart order, from paccheri in a suede-brown buffalo ragu (how handsome!) to cauliflower caramelle, little dumplings filled with sweet root vegetable puree. But the real head-turner here is seaweed bucatini. The soft, dark noodles arrive draped under a blanket of rose-colored petals, a red Lamborghini with a black leather interior. Those petals, as it turns out, are lobster coral; the kitchen shapes the roe and shaves it like truffles. The taste is pure shellfish and ocean water, intensified by a factor of a hundred.',\n",
       "  \"There are heftier mains, too, that don't quite deliver in the same way — a somewhat spongy sous-vide beef here, a too-sweet honey glazed chicken for two there. Better to stick with the pastas and finish off with caraway rye ice cream — that High Street bread game is everywhere. And as you leave, the host offers you a tray of cookies to choose from on your way out the door.\",\n",
       "  \"It's all quite amazing: As New York operators streamline and strip down their operations in this era of high rents and rising minimum wages, a guy from Philadelphia rides into town and makes an affordable little restaurant feel as bountiful as Eleven Madison Park and as welcoming as a Thanksgiving at your aunt's house.

       "  \"Capital of the landlocked Telangana state, Hyderabad has in recent years transformed itself into South India's Silicon Valley. Perhaps some of that newfound wealth has found its way to Jersey City, because the India Square neighborhood has lately been hopping with restaurants inspired by the techie powerhouse. Over the last few years several newcomers have focused on biryani, including Paradise Biryani Pointe, Biryani Pot, and Bawarchi Biryani Corner. While this decorated rice dish at least partly inspired by Middle Eastern pilaf is common in northern India, it's also the signature of Hyderabad, which has a unique Muslim history.\",\n",
       "  \"Two newer restaurants specializing in Hyderabadi fare have appeared over the last three months. We're not talking dosas and idlis here (though many cafes in Jersey City peddle those), but a whole other catalog of South Indian regional cuisines. One of the restaurants is called Hyderabadi House, with the same owners as Sri Ganesh's Dosa House, just across the street. You might have expected the new joint to also be vegetarian, but far from it. Hyderabadi House serves up excellent goat biryani and goat curries, in addition to kutt mirchi (fiery green chiles fried in a chickpea batter) and eggs put to surprising uses, including an egg masala that immerses the boiled variety in a rich peanut gravy.\",\n",
       "  'Exterior.',\n",
       "  'Just down Newark Avenue from Hyderabadi House, with a view of the elevated highways that crisscross the sunken Meadowlands beyond, lies the subject of this review — Golconda Chimney. Golconda means \"shepherd\\'s hill,\" and refers to a citadel on the edge of Hyderabad that was once the seat of a medieval sultanate; now it lies in ruins, all coruscated walls and arched passageways rising in tiers against the cliff, furnishing a spectacular view of the city to the east. Golconda Fort was once the center of India\\'s diamond trade, and the name has come to symbolize vast wealth.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant is handsome and somewhat luxurious, with flagstone wainscoting doubtlessly intended to symbolize the fort. The place seats about 80 in a deep, sparsely decorated room. Golconda Chimney offers a more sophisticated take on the cuisines of Hyderabad and South India than the other restaurants in Jersey City. In fact, it deserves to be counted among places like Indian Accent, Babu Ji, and Tapestry that are lately heralding an Indian dining renaissance in New York City. In contrast to those other places, though, the food tends to be more assertive and more highly spiced, perhaps because most of the patrons are South Asian, while Manhattan restaurants often tone down their spice palettes for a mixed audience.',\n",
       "  \"If you're a goat lover, Golconda Chimney is for you. On its sprawling 18-page menu, 17 selections incorporating the horned and sure-footed beast are listed. There's a goat biryani ($13.99), of course, featuring succulent boneless pieces among the spice-scented grains, with a boiled egg perched like a bulbous white bird on top. It comes sided with thick yogurt raita. Also worth trying is goat sukha, a bony mass in an oily chile bath that makes it seem almost Sichuan. Gnaw away!\",\n",

My favorite, though, is goat paya soup ($6.59), made with leathery and gummy shank in a silky broth glinting with collagen droplets. \"This will be very good for my skin!\" one of my vainer guests proclaimed enthusiastically.',\n",
       "  'Chicken is another Hyderabad favorite, as evidenced by such South Indian regional classics as chicken chettinad ($11.99), featuring tomatoes, coconut, and poppy seeds. Native to the city, dum ka murg ($14.99) immerses bone-in chicken morsels in a mellow sauce thickened with cashews and chironji (seeds of the Buchanania lanzan tree, which taste like almonds). Such ingredients, exotic to most New Yorkers, abound at Golconda Chimney, where every meal is an adventure in culinary geography. But one of the best chicken dishes comes from the Indo-Chinese canon: Chicken lollipop ($9.99) features the drumstick with the flesh pushed to the top, tinted bright red and fried, with just a hint of heat — like Buffalo wings with an Indian twist.',\n",

Pescatarians will be delighted by machli ka salan — white filet swimming in a dark pool of astringent fenugreek leaves. The menu offers fairly lengthy descriptions of each dish, so if you don't have a South Indian food expert with you, you're not entirely on your own.

       "  'As someone who spends three-quarters of the year dining across America, I’m often surprised by the restaurant experiences I remember most vividly. The meals that I return to again and again in my mind don’t strictly map onto the “best” meals I’ve had — those white-tablecloth extravagances and the innovative dishes that end up reshaping the dining culture. A truly memorable meal can just as easily take place in a small neighborhood restaurant that has achieved honest, obvious value in its community. ',\n",
       "  'The indications that a restaurant might be such a place are usually obvious. A line spills out the door but moves fast. Staffers extend a real sense of welcome to regulars and first-timers alike. The food is reasonably priced and of surprisingly high quality. Whether the star attraction is sublime pizza or a sustaining noodle bowl or a brilliantly engineered sandwich, the dish mesmerizes with its craftsmanship and expressiveness. Beyond the accomplished service and remarkable food, these restaurants possess an ineffable sense of community and place. They reflect their city or town or rural stretch of highway more profoundly than just about any other restaurant could. Really, coming upon modest places that accomplish all this is as rare as finding a genuinely stunning high-end indulgence.',\n",
       "  \"One of the finest examples of this type of restaurant is Seattle's tiny Il Corvo. Owner Mike Easton crafts three daily-changing pastas as the centerpiece of his menu, which he serves only for lunch on Monday through Friday. No dinner; no weekends. Service begins at 11 a.m., and by noon a ragged, cheerful line reaches back to the door of the 36-seat space.\",\n",
       "  \"When I ate there on a mild October day last year, the veneer of pesto on a slinky twirl of tagliarini radiated mint, and the sauce's herbal harmonics (there was also basil and parsley) resounded clear and bright on the palate. Swirly fusilli came tossed with crisp wisps of house-made pancetta, slivers of red cabbage and soft braised fennel. More recently, Easton paired the complex torchietti, a pasta made with curvy, ridged twists of dough, with simple, reassuring walnut and spring onion cream sauce. The menu's only near-constant dish is pappardelle alla Bolognese. The coil of wide noodles, slicked with meaty gravy and finished with a generous grating of Parmigiano-Reggiano, is served year-round, even on warm August days. Easton knows that some comforts transcend the seasons.\",\n",
       "  'Pappardelle alla Bolognese at Il Corvo.',\n",
       "  \"Here's the kicker: Easton charges a mere $9 for these pastas. In a way the price is sensible: The Italian staple may be labor-intensive but the ingredients are inexpensive. Handmade pasta consists of just flour and eggs or flour and water, after all. But I can't think of another instance in my 15-year career as a critic where I've encountered such astounding pasta for under $10. The remaining roster of dishes listed on the restaurant's chalkboard usually includes a handful of rotating, affordable antipasti: perhaps prosciutto scattered with diced pickled celery, or a bowl of mixed olives, or a salad built around kale or chickpeas. But for both flavor and price, the pastas are the undeniable scene-stealers.\",\n",
       "  \"Easton's mastery and affordability have propelled Il Corvo to local cult status. He deserves it. This is the kind of animated, community-minded restaurant I wish for every neighborhood in America. That said, I've visited a great deal of neighborhoods in the past few years, and I've never come across any place quite like it.\",\n",
       "  \"Il Corvo began in the same way as a number of new independent projects by chefs: as a permanent pop-up. In 2011 Easton was working as executive chef at Seattle's Lecosho, a restaurant where entrees like New York strip with braised kale, fingerling potatoes, and chanterelle-leek ragu goes for $33. Easton longed to spend more time with his young family, and after a trip to Italy he'd begun geeking out on pasta-making. He obsessed over the recipe proportions and started acquiring the antique rollers, spindles and extruders used to shape the dough into endless forms.\",\n",
       "  'His friend Brian Garrity owned Procopio Gelateria in Pike Place Market; Easton had actually pulled espresso and scooped frozen treats there in 1999 when he first moved to Seattle. After leaving Lecosho, Easton approached Garrity about renting space in the gelateria for his pasta experiment.',\n",
       "  'From the start, Easton\\'s plan was to serve only lunch. \"I was crafting more of a lifestyle than a restaurant,\" he said by phone. \"I don\\'t mind getting up early. And crafting pasta is such a pursuit —\\x80\\x94 I love the artistry and figuring out which forms work symbiotically with the sauce.\"',\n",
       "  'Juggling three butane burners, an electric pasta boiler, and the occasional gelato order, Easton ran his pop-up on the thinnest of shoestrings. But his masterful pastas became a sensation with local critics and diners, enabling Il Corvo to open in their current space on a steep hill in the Pioneer Square area in January 2013.',\n",
       "  'The exterior of Il Corvo.',\n",
       "  \"These days Easton and his crew crank out 250 to 300 portions of pasta every shift. And they're slowly building what might be the country's most humble restaurant empire. Il Corvo's success enabled Easton and longtime employee Johannes Heitzeberg to open a second restaurant, Pizzeria Gabbiano, in late 2014. The concept specializes in thin, Roman-style focaccia topped with combinations like capicola, caramelized onions, and fennel fronds. Like Il Corvo, Gabbiano is also open solely for weekday lunch, and a meal there is efficient and uplifting: We put it on Eater's inaugural Best New Restaurants list last year.\",\n",
       "  'Easton is also gearing up to retail his pastas, since customers at Il Corvo have been asking about buying noodles for years. This summer he plans to open a pasta shop with 10 or 12 daily options and sauces to match. An Italian pasta drying cabinet is currently en route to Seattle.',\n",
       "  \"Happily, no empire-building distractions show through at Il Corvo. Easton is still there around 6 a.m. every morning, gauging the weather to determine if the day's customers might prefer warming pasta e fagioli or uplifting tagliatelle with pea shoot and almond pesto. And then he gets to work.\",\n",
       "  \"Il Corvo is notable first and foremost because the pastas are soul-stirring and eloquently fashioned. But Easton's cooking also keeps returning to me because pasta culture around the country has stretched to polar extremes. In its infinite variations, the dish is rendered as either a quick hunger stopgap prepared without much finesse, or serves as a blank slate for upscale showmanship involving uni and caviar and shaved truffles. Il Corvo returns pasta to its place of essential goodness. The restaurant turns dough into happy-making strands and whimsical shapes. Beautifully pitched sauces balance acid, freshness, and heft.\",\n",
       "  \"Maintaining pasta's core simplicity while treating every aspect of the dish with respect did more than bring good Italian food to the neighborhood: it created community. A lovingly made pasta lunch is both so obviously satisfying and so uncommon that there's a sense of lightheartedness in the room. I've noticed no one seems overly fidgety or cranky in the line. For pasta this winning at $9 a pop, a little wait feels acceptable. Portions seem spot-on, not heaping but certainly not skimpy. (And hell, if you have a big appetite, get two pastas. The cost would still be less than the pasta dishes in many tonier restaurants.)\",\n",
       "  'The service further fosters this sense of community, both in its warmth and efficiency. A sign near the entrance details the rules of etiquette: \"Order at the counter. Select a seat AFTER YOU\\'VE PLACED YOUR ORDER. Bus your own table. Enjoy your lunch.\" The brusque wording may have offended some customers early on, but the directives did their job: the place has a rhythm that works. Once you\\'ve paid and your lunch is ready, an available seat is never long in coming. Most of the tables are four-tops, though I\\'ve noticed groups with empty chairs often invite solo strangers to join them. It\\'s a thoroughly democratic shindig, with people of all backgrounds and occupations crammed into the rectangular room.',\n",
       "  \"Il Corvo reflects one of the most hopeful facets of our current restaurant culture, where skill, quality and price all meet to serve a city. When friends visiting Seattle ask for restaurant recommendations, I invariably send them the link to Easton's blog, where he dutifully details each day's pastas. That list sells them, and when they go they can't believe the energy, the prices, the deliciousness. Locals and travelers alike tell me they return for lunch over and over. In a city with so many compelling restaurants, I'm tempted to encourage variety. But honestly, when I'm in Seattle, I too join the line for Easton's pastas over and over again.\"],\n",

There’s the creative Batali that we know. The kitchen slathers caserecce pasta (a cousin to fusilli) with a gossamer coating of broccoli rabe pesto, chiles, and sesame, imparting the noodles with an assertively nutty and exhilaratingly bitter finish.

In the timeline of New York restaurants, Babbo is an essential precursor to restaurants like Momofuku and the Spotted Pig, serving up some of the city’s most iconic and creative pastas, at relatively accessible prices, to a soundtrack of Eminem and Led Zeppelin. In his 2004 review of the restaurant, then-New York Times critic Frank Bruni cited Babbo’s choice of music (and the volume at which it was blasted) as a reason for withholding a fourth star from the venue. But the music never changed — and the crowds never subsided. Del Posto, in contrast, does not play Eminem.

But the focus is a pile of pork tidbits known as carnitas. They’re emphatically not the dense fibrous cubes you usually get, but a soft, plump, moist, beige-colored heap that tumbles off the tortilla and onto the plate, tasting engagingly porky. In the Mexican fashion, the taco is finished with cilantro and sweet white onions, chopped so fine they almost fling off a mist. Three homemade salsas stand at the ready. This carnitas taco ($4) is easily one of the best tacos in New York City.',\n",
       "  'I first encountered those wonderful pork fragments late in 2013 with a phalanx of food writers who regularly shuttled up to the South Bronx to taste Denisse Lina Chavez’s cooking in a tiny bodega called El Atoradero. Later, there would be a small café next door, but at this time, a makeshift cauldron was set up in the middle of the bodega every Saturday. A bevy of neighborhood women — Salvadoran, Dominican, and Mexican — assisted Chavez by cubing the pork, perpetually stirring the pot, and performing such other tasks as hand-forming the picaditas — ridged masa discs tailor-made to hold the soupy carnitas.',\n",

       "  'What challenges Chavez must have faced as she thought about the promises and perils of the new location in a far more upscale part of town! Price rises, certainly, but would she go the route of chef Cosme Aguilar at Long Island City’s Casa Enrique, who created a bistro-ized menu featuring ceviches, composed salads, and showy regional dishes from his home state of Chiapas? Or would she stick with the same bodega menu from small-town Atlixco, in Puebla, that she had mounted in Mott Haven, keeping the full-meal prices in the teens, rather than offering entrees in the mid-20s, as Aguilar did?',\n",
       "  'She went the cheaper route, and thus the dining genre of El Atoradero nowadays might best be described as Enhanced Taqueria. Grab a couple of tacos and a beer and you won’t break the bank. Order an entrée, and you get a fully loaded plate at a bargain price. Many of the main courses are the same as those presented in the Bronx. There are meatballs stuffed with quail eggs, served in a zingy tomato sauce; a mole poblano more nutty than sweet, poured over cheese enchiladas or a quarter chicken; pork ribs and purslane in a green salsa more tart than hot; and — a weekend favorite back home in Puebla — great gobbets of the funky lamb steamed in banana leaves, called barbacoa.

You may scratch your head and wonder why a cafe mimicking the menu of a home kitchen in Puebla would offer such Americanized Mexican food as burritos, but this is part of the democratized feel of the place.

       "  'It\\'s a bold move. Even bolder: Stupak\\'s version of this meaty treat contains no flesh, just achiote-rubbed pineapple and a few slices of lardo. Inverse al pastor is the name, making it perhaps the first taco to take its cue from the formal language of logic. \"A basic formula for creativity is to change the proportions,\" says the 35-year-old, who speaks in the tone one might expect from a Yale chemistry professor lecturing to a crowd of three hundred. Stupak, in this case, is speaking to four people.',\n",

And as you eat, you start to come to terms with the following: That the final savory course of an expensive tasting isn't a cumbersome protein meant to be cut with Laguiole knife but rather a fruit taco whose sauces are meant to dribble down your chin. That this Mexican-inspired affair is the only non-Japanese omakase where the primary utensils are your hands. That pineapple with lardo manages to be a more savory expression of what you've always imagined to al pastor to be. And that Stupak, the guy who hawks nachos on St. Marks Place and guac in the West Village, has earned a spot as one of New York's most exciting tasting menu chefs.\",\n",
       "  \"When a high-tech chef rides into town to cook for a night or two – be it Grant Achatz, Jordan Kahn, or Albert Adria – Empellon Cocina is frequently where the action takes place, and with good reason: aside from Stupak, there aren't a whole lot of modernist-trained chefs running their own restaurants in the Big Apple.\",\n",
       "  \"New York is indisputably one of the dining capitals of the world, but it's never really been a global destination for the type of experimental cuisine found in Barcelona (Tickets), Bray (The Fat Duck), or Chicago (Alinea). Our neo-classical city, with teems of bankers itching for protein-heavy client dinners, has a solid track record of sending avant-garde spots to the grave, from Varietal (mushroom desserts), to Corton (sashimi-stuffed cotton candy), to Sam Mason's Tailor (bubble gum cocktails and spherical veal), to WD~50, the Michelin-starred purveyor of pizza pebbles, knotted foie gras, coconut egg whites, and carrot juice yolks that employed Stupak as pastry chef for four years.\",\n",
       "  \"Perhaps the memories of a recession-era battering (along with rising labor costs) have prompted New York restaurateurs to channel more of their creative juices not into their cuisine but rather into their business models, with chefs toying around with no-tipping policies, lightly-staffed fast casual spots, and tiny stalls in epic food halls. Stupak's kitchen counter, accordingly, is not a separate restaurant, but rather four seats in the back of his East Village Cocina. Every spot is paid for in advance via the Tock ticketing system, at $95 for the 6 p.m. seating, and at $165 for the longer 8 p.m. seating.

They\\'re not an uncommon ingredient in New York\\'s Mexican restaurants, but at tasting menu venues, bugs are somewhat of a rarity. Stupak crushes them up with a mortar and pestle. \"They taste more like celery salt this way,\" he says, using the smashed remains to garnish a single bite of fried chicken wing. Delicious. But if you don\\'t dig it, another course is minutes away, perhaps blood sopes anointed by heady boudin noir; both the corn cake and the sausage crumble in the mouth like a musky, offal-y brownie.',\n",

Shorter menus typically breed more conservative preparations – a chef has less room for error because of a higher price per course. Longer menus, by contrast, allow for more risk, as a dish that doesn't work is forgotten nine courses later. Stupak, to his credit, balances this gastronomic philosophy with the more pragmatic reality that people occasionally want more than a single bite of something. So instead of sending out a never-ending supply of wedding buffet-sized hors d'oeuvres, preparations grow and shrink throughout the meal, a little bit of palate teasing here, a hint of hunger sating there. A ten bite plate of celery root sashimi with coconut cream and chile ash mayo – an abstract study in black and white – is followed by a poached oyster topped with nixtamalized popcorn kernels – simple food that just tastes good.\",\n",

Then there's the classic Oaxacan black mole, which comes not as a chicken smothering sauce but as a star ingredient in its own right, an inky ice cream whose warming spice contradicts its cool temperature. A plate of prune sorbet with agar agar spiraled chocolate ganache appears soon after – followed by orange sorbet in gossamer gellan gum tuiles (edible cones as thin as Saran Wrap) – and you start to wonder whether you're back at WD~50.

And as New Yorkers increasingly fly to Mexico City to splurge on elegant tasting menus (or spend $125 per person at Cosme in the Flatiron), they\\'ll learn to dispense with the rosy eyed myths of authenticity and let Mexican food continue to do what cuisines hailing from countries with Michelin stars are allowed to do: evolve.

The premises seemed far older, as if it had once been a diner or soda fountain, with composite-stone floors, spaceship light fixtures, and twirling stools along a white-tiled counter. In those days it had a reputation for being the only decent place to eat within walking distance of the Javits Center. Still, despite an eclectic French and Italian menu (with some surprise Swedish twists thrown in around Christmastime), the food was hit or miss, and one was well advised to stick with the steak frites.',\n",

Crack a classic like Köstritzer, though, and you’ll soon note that lightness lurks in the dark.

The words are his version of a prayer he remembered from Buddhist ceremonial meals in Korea. He liked the intention behind the invocation, the reminder not to cling so tightly to ego, and wanted it to inform the vision for his restaurant.

He graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park in 2009, spent time afterward at Daniel in New York and the Nobu outpost in the Bahamas, and staged at restaurants like Noma and Spain's Quique Dacosta. He moved to Los Angeles last year and immediately jumped into running 16-seat Baroo, along with Matthew Kim, a childhood friend. It's just the two of them, cooking and serving lunch five days a week and dinner every night but Monday. They prepare around seven plates, $9 to $15 apiece, mostly grain salads and pastas. From these basic formats, they build symphonic raptures.\",\n",
       "  \"Take the dish Uh calls noorook. The name is a phonetic spelling for the Korean version of koji, the rice culture inoculated with the mold aspergillus oryzae that acts as a starter for things like miso, sake, and soy sauce. Uh blends the noorook with pureed roasted beets and cream, which he adds to a mix of pleasantly chewy grains —\\xa0Job's tears, kamut, and farro — and then surrounds with a dizzying number of other ingredients: seaweed dashi, toasted sunflower and pumpkin seeds, macadamia nuts, finger lime segments, and a few wisps of onion pickled with rose.\",\n",

I felt not just sated after finishing it, but nourished.\",\n",

Kim occasionally stepped into the kitchen to help, but Uh did most of the cooking alone. While waiting for my friends to arrive, I stood off to the side and watched him compose his bibim salad, a riff on Korean bibimbap. He covered a mix of quinoa, oats, and bulgur in a dressing of tomato and gochujang (fermented chile paste), drizzled an herb coulis around the plate, and buried the grains in an artful pile of shaved fennel, celery, radish, and other vegetables. And then he went on to the next task.\",\n",

Los Angeles is fertile ground right now for similarly tiny restaurants run by accomplished chefs who want to cook from the heart without enormous overhead.

The session IPA’s a bit chewy, gritty even, a not unpleasant emblem of hop hash. The resin, from Amarillo hops, imparts all the penetrating aromatics for which IPA lovers go ape, a focused charge, floral and orange-y, amplified by dry-hopping with watermelon-like El Dorado and citrusy Ahtanum.

       "  '\\n  Fifteen years ago an LA friend introduced me to the pleasures of scarfing noodles on Hollywood Boulevard. In the area known as Thai Town, the restaurants were quite different from the ones here in NY. Sure, New York has Isan places serving the fiery salads of northeastern Thailand, and khao soi cafes from the Chinese-leaning city of Chiang Mai. We have restaurants slinging the curries and basil stir fries of central Thailand, some focusing on Bangkok. And we have places like Pok Pok and Kiin Thai that take a scholarly pan-regional approach. But those Hollywood stars concentrated almost exclusively on noodle soups. My mind was blown.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'It’s been possible to find a few dishes on most Thai menus in town typical of those served at places like Hollywood’s Sanamluang, but nothing like its collection of 20 or so noodle entrees. Until 2014, that is, when Pye Boat Noodle appeared in Astoria. The lively place is tricked out like a tropical Quonset hut — all waffled metal, louvered typhoon shutters, and worm-eaten wood. The uniformed waiters are sassy, the service fast, and the food inexpensive.',\n",
       "  'Like the heroine of Brian De Palma’s Carrie, you may encounter pig blood. It’s an important component of boat noodles with pork ($9.95), also known as nam tok. The \"boat\" part refers to sampans that ply the waters of Bangkok’s canals, where the dish was invented in 1942. Like floating McDonaldses, they ladle out fast food, in this case rice noodles in a slightly sweet broth darkly flavored with soy sauce and blood, jumbled with sliced pork, pork meatballs, and crunchy pork rind. Blood makes the soup richer. In Bangkok you’d also get some offal, but who’s complaining?',\n",

For lovers of the color pink, there’s yen ta fo noodle ($10.95), seething with shrimp, shrimp balls, fish balls, squid rings, and frilly white fungus in a  too-sweet chicken broth thickened with bean paste — which is where the color comes from. If you prefer dry noodles without soup, then bamee phoo moo dang hang may be your thing. Egg noodles something like curly packaged ramen are tossed with thick slices of pork belly and shreds of crabmeat. Handfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro provide verdency in this dish often peddled in Thailand from carts late at night.',\n",
       "  'A similar noodle joint with the hippie-sounding name of Plant Love House opened on Elmhurst’s Whitney Avenue near the end of 2014. Competing with a half-dozen other Thai cafes in the immediate vicinity with more predictable menus, it never quite developed the following it needed to succeed. So it boldly picked up and moved to Brooklyn, to the Prospect Heights restaurant frontier of Washington Avenue. Cryptically changing its name to Look By Plant Love House, it mounted a similar noodle-focused menu in a deep space with two cramped dining rooms (sit in the front barroom instead), a premises that had failed as several previous establishments, including a clam bar and an Italian restaurant with Israeli flourishes.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, the food now is spectacular, perhaps a notch above Pye Boat’s. Boat noodles (guay taio num tok, $11) remain the flagship, here with more piquancy and with blood that seems better integrated into the broth. (There are no tiny clots around the rim, as at Pye Boat). If you’ve previously experienced tom yum as a small bowl of forgettable soup served as an appetizer, you’ll sit up and take notice of Plant Love’s rendition. In a broth propelled by lime juice and fish sauce swim all sorts of proteinaceous ingredients, plus a bonus fried wonton and lots of crushed peanuts. You won’t know where to start. Ask for it \"Thai spicy\" and it will leave you gasping between spoonfuls.',\n",

       "  'Once upon a time, in a pre-hoverboard world, Americans fell in love with a personal transport device known as the Hummer, a military-inspired, six-thousand-pound behemoth designed to beat up all the other cars in the Nordstrom parking lot. Then gas prices surged, and societal awareness of climate change skyrocketed. All of a sudden, the truck’s 12 miles per gallon seemed like not such great choice for driving your daughter to move-in at Oberlin. So people stopped buying them, and eventually General Motors stopped making them, instead focusing their attention on what buyers seemed to want: lighter, cheaper, more fuel-efficient cars. And the few Hummers that remained on the streets were revered (sort of) or reviled (hello) as classics (or relics). ',\n",
       "  'I recount this tale because if you were to apply to the New York City steakhouse the same consumer logic that precipitated both the rise and the fall of the Hummer, you should theoretically end up with the same result.

It's surprising that the genre has shown such intransigence in adapting to the financial straits of aspiring gourmands, in giving anything more than a curtsy toward our (nominally) healthier culinary zeitgeist, or in addressing the disparity between waiter pay and cook pay.

With its dark, moist flesh redolent of burning autumn leaves, half a mallard of good size arrives fully articulated, with a thin layer of fat quaking (if not quacking) beneath the supremely crisp skin.

But if you really crave incendiary, head for Yibin burning noodles ($8.95), named for a small city in southeastern Sichuan. Found on the restaurant's separate brunch menu, this spaghetti cook-up comes gobbed with sweet soy sauce, red-chile flakes, and the aforementioned peppercorns, which will leave you gasping as you reach for your water glass.

Per Se, after all, wasn't a Lamborghini, an out-of-reach-acquisiton that makes the buyer look like a jerk; Per Se was a night out to see Hamilton: a cultural phenomenon that middle-class food-o-philes saved up for. It was a place to understand old French indulgences (foie gras, truffles) and to seek fluency in new American luxuries (sous-vide short ribs, cryovac melons). Then the prices went up and the food went downhill. The New York Times published a devastating pan, and this critic said the tired cuisine was about what one would expect out of a high-end shopping mall. It all raises the question: Where does one now splurge for a crash course in modern fine dining? Simple: You visit the only major Kings County restaurant with a no-jeans policy.

A layer of trout mousse underneath coats your palate, tempering all the unctuous excess. This is when you realize that chef Cesar Ramirez is subtly telling you that he can do better than Keller.

As rooms shrank, the number of courses seemed to grow, giving risk-taking chefs more room to experiment. This reality, alas, also produced syllable-sized dishes served at such a rapid pace they sometimes felt like real-time slideshows of food, edible press releases designed to be instantly preserved in the electronic amber of Instagram.

Guests who were twenty minutes late would find themselves seven courses behind. (I once double fisted a few bites to catch up.) No pictures or note-taking were allowed; when I asked about this a few years back, Ramirez just smiled and quipped, \"I just want everyone to leave their guns at the door.\" The lack of a liquor license meant diners brought their own wines, chilled their own wines (you had to make cute little snow mountains with crushed ice to chill the bottlenecks), and poured their own wines.

In fact, friends and I developed the habit of sneaking into the place around six in the evening, just before it got slammed. We'd sit at the bar and knock back a glass of wine and a vinegary mussels escabeche on toast, or a bright red beef tartare crunchy with sunchokes.\",\n",
       "  \"So, if you're Mattos and partner Thomas Carter, what do you do for an encore three years down the road? The answer is, you let the pendulum swing in a more conservative direction, highlighting bankable rather than groundbreaking. Hence, Cafe Altro Paradiso, which partly functions as a surprisingly conventional Italian restaurant. Seating around 90, the U-shaped, high-ceilinged room sits behind a sliver of park at Spring and 6th Avenue, a non-neighborhood whose main commercial denizens are an outsize Trump hotel condominium and the modernistic new God's Love We Deliver.\",\n",

Modest in size, both dishes were priced at $18.\",\n",

The best starters cover the plate like an abstract canvas. A fluke crudo ($16) intersperses limpid swatches of raw fish and caper berries, irrigated with pungent olive oil; burrata flattened like a schnitzel plays tag with cured lemon rind and market greens; and a simple pork sausage poises like a blimp fallen from the skies next to a hedge of cooked greens.

Four or five in number on a series of menus, the pastas ($19 to $27) are small for the price, making sharing difficult. Simply stuffed with scintillating ricotta, the half-moon ravioli are invariably a good choice. One evening they were sauced with verdant nettles, and on another occasion, stuffed instead with prosciutto, they shone in a broth with fresh favas.

But the hozon replaces the gorgeously stinky overtones of pecorino with a marked sweetness, one that the warming pepper more or less manages to keep in check. (A little finishing salt, provided upon request, helps even more). It\\'s a dessert pretending to be a savory pasta, and it\\'s absolutely majestic.',\n",

What makes Nishi so exciting is that Pinsky is forcing New Yorkers to look beyond the framework of regional Roman or Sicilian traditions (or American red sauce affairs), and to meditate upon the fact that Italian food can be just as compelling when it's completely (and sometimes unrecognizably) interpreted through the eyes of another culture or chef. Nishi's food rebels against the shackles of authenticity.\",\n",

Sure, that's perhaps one more cocktail than the average dinner order, and yes, a zero-gratuity check is always going to be higher than one without. But still, instead of seeing the inconveniences and unpleasantness of the dining room reflected in a lower cost on my bill, I was paying close to fine-dining prices for the opportunity to sit on a seriously uncomfortable stool for the time it took to eat three courses and linger over a drink, and stare at a wall.\",\n",
       "  'On another night, I again showed up as a walk-in (most of Nishi\\'s seats are unreserved; limited online bookings are snapped up weeks in advance), and the host quoted a 40 minute wait — at 10 p.m. Not a problem, I can\\'t criticize a restaurant for being popular, so I told her I\\'d just wait around inside. \"Actually, we have a few parties coming in,\" she said. \"So we\\'ll text you when your seat is ready.\" I was sent back outside, into the 17-degree weather.

That's why critics visit more than once, and why we usually wait a while for a restaurant to find its groove.

The question it raises, however, is whether other diners know that Chang knows that Nishi isn\\'t up to par, whether they know they\\'re paying full price for something a prominent, experienced restaurateur will preemptively acknowledge isn\\'t good enough. And there\\'s also the question of why Chang, a seasoned businessman, would keep running an establishment that his team admits is the wrong space for that concept, rather than temporarily closing and re-building the restaurant that his talented staff and loyal guests deserve.

Tick off all the ways you can burn your mouth these days: Mexican, Thai, Indian, Korean, Ethiopian, and, of course, Chinese — of which its most incendiary evocation is Sichuan, right? There’s one type of Chinese cooking that\\'s often hotter. Just to the southeast of Sichuan in the province of Hunan is a cuisine considered fierier, though it generally omits the electric excitement of ma la peppercorns. Instead, Hunan deploys a devastating combination of dried red chiles, fresh green chiles, black and white peppercorns, and — somewhat unique to its arsenal — pickled chiles, often used in soupy recipes like \"steamed fish head with chopped chiles.\"',\n",
       "  'Ferried to the table in a broad, bone-white bowl, the appearance couldn’t be more striking. Rising in the middle like Moby Dick, pectoral fin pointed skyward in the semblance of a wave, a humongous fish head quavers. A good quantity of saffron-colored fluid sloshes around its perimeter, in which bits of pickled chile dance. Atop the head is a heap of chopped scallions, and the color combo of bright red chiles and dark green onions against the gray fish makes it feel like Christmas in March.',\n",

This magnificent broth can serve to moisten gallons of fleecy white rice, as the assembled diners take turns picking bits of flesh off the head, milky eyeballs first. The $26.95 price tag partly reflects the cultural value of this dish, since an entire fish with lots more flesh with an equal quantity of sauce paradoxically costs $2 less.',\n",

Which should be totally unnecessary given the excellence of its offerings and uniqueness of Hunan food in the East Village.',\n",

Aside from the mixture of chiles, the cuisine boasts lots of preserved meats and vegetables, a broad array of cooking techniques not involving woks, and a strange propensity for mashing seemingly incongruous things. Thus green pepper with preserved egg ($14.95) arrives in a bowl already half-squished, but with a wooden pestle picturesquely sticking out as an invitation to further maceration. In the bowl are fresh green chiles, eggplant, and a couple of 100-year-old eggs, in which the whites have been transformed into translucent obsidian. The taste is fascinating, but one time the mash-up was hot as hell, another it was bland baby food.',\n",

(The same vegetable appears to great effect in the highly recommended beef with pickled cabbage.) Meats and vegetables preserved by salting and drying also play an important role in the cuisine.

Just as a chef has more opportunities to try and fail with experimental dishes over a long tasting menu, rather than having to play it safe over a four-course meal (where, due to the limited scope, each course has to knock it out of the park), an aggressive half bottle program encourages diners to take more risks while drinking.\",\n",

Pastas are distinctly average, from the gritty, overcooked, undersalted Roman gnocchi, to porchetta agnolotti, which takes two powerful flavors — black garlic and braised pork — and somehow makes them almost unnoticeable. Chicken is overcooked, and tilefish is a study in how to drown delicate maritime flesh with too much olive oil.

Beer fermentation tanks contain a sampling spigot called a zwickel (pronounced zv-ick-el), which lets brewers taste evolving, unfiltered liquid.

This $16 bowlful of sunshine features perfectly cooked crustaceans heaped on chunky yellow grits, around which a flavorful reddish-brown broth swishes. So far, it’s a pure evocation of a famous Southern dish. But The Heyward embroiders on the regular recipe by substituting chorizo for bacon, then nonchalantly tossing some shishito peppers on top. Though decidedly non-doctrinaire, this version is one of the finest the city has seen since Edna Lewis left. (Shrimp and grits was a cornerstone of her 1976 landmark, The Taste of Country Cooking.)',\n",

The seats are comfortable and adult-sized; some are even padded. \"Is this place aimed at an older crowd?\" A friend inquired as she scanned the laid-back space, where she saw four divided dining zones, one of which provides stools along a semicircular counter looking into a chef’s work area that is more theater than conventional kitchen. The white-clad cooks therein dabble in the Lowcountry cooking of coastal South Carolina, which is a dangerous enterprise. Many previous New York restaurants have foundered on the rocks of American regional cooking.',\n",

At The Heyward, heirloom field peas and Carolina gold rice from Anson Mills are used, the way Sean Brock does it at his celebrated Charleston restaurants. Additionally, a piece of seared and browned pork belly is laid across the top, in a salute to Brooklyn’s favorite part of the pig. A contrasting dish substituting sunnyside-up eggs for pork belly appears on the brunch menu. Both are worth ordering, with the beans displaying assertive savor.',\n",

Paradoxically, most of the Lowcountry standards are found in the appetizer and side dish sections of the menu. That’s OK, because it’s easy enough to make a meal out of small plates. In addition to the shrimp and grits and hoppin’ John, one might include the sweet-corn-and-pimento succotash (which is not really succotash, because where are the lima beans?), the fried green tomatoes (they recently disappeared from the menu, but will hopefully reappear once summer returns, or the green-tomato truck rolls in from Florida), and the excellent cornbread, which might be mistaken for fine cake.',\n",

The thick pork chop on a gravel of heirloom carrots is tasty enough, but the hanger steak ($27) hides its few sliced pieces in too much salad for the price, and the roasted cod entrée is just plain dull.

Though I don’t usually bother with brunch (broken Hollandaise provokes my gag reflex more certainly than any other substance), I did have a wonderful dish one Sunday morning at The Heyward. Called the French toast sandwich ($15) and recommended by my editor, it wrapped two thick, egg-drenched brioche slices slathered with fig jam around luxuriantly wadded country ham and moist scrambled eggs.

The chef, who prepares my entire meal with no assistance, fans his charcoal behind the counter, wondering if I\\'m going to eat.

But in this more exclusive area, curtained off like a first class airline cabin, I\\'m the sole guest. The bill of fare is a $140 tasting of chicken parts, surely the most expensive poultry omakase in New York, if not North America altogether. Chef Atsushi Kono has already fed me whole hearts from six pound birds, slices of loin as medium-rare as Minetta steak, and something called main artery, which looks like what would happen if Steven Seagal plunged his hands into the neck of a live rooster and ripped out its carotid, just because. All of these preparations are delicious. But now Atsushi has upped the ante. He places a skewer in front of me. \"Knee bone,\" he says. Am I really supposed to eat the bone? He smiles. \"You eat the bone.\"',\n",
       "  \"The skewer contains four ostensibly edible knobs. They have not been braised, liquefied, or pulverized, nor have they been boiled into a clear consommé or a milky tonkotsu. They are simply spheres of bone covered by a gumdrop's worthy of charred meat. Soft on the outside and hard on the inside, they are inverted Tootsie Roll lollipops for carnivores.

But it's somewhat unexpected when offered as part of pricier, multi-course meals like this one. Instead of caviar, we're serving kneecap tonight. Despite the city's ongoing craze for paleo broths and crispysardine skeletons, chicken bones haven't really earned a spot on hip Brooklyn menus alongside tripe, feet, and other in vogue off cuts.\",\n",
       "  'I start to gnaw on the ossiferous treat. The bone goes SNAP between my molars, shattering like a under-licked gobstopper. Japanese menus sometimes refer to this delicacy as \"soft\" knee bone, but rest assured, it is not soft. \"We like the crunch,\" the chef tells me. So do I. The bone has no flavor. It is pure texture. It is the adult equivalent of a child eating a plastic Happy Meal toy, minus all the digestive repercussions. It is one of the final frontiers in honoring an animal that unwillingly sacrificed itself for our enjoyment. It is, without question, one of the reasons why Tori Shin remains the city\\'s best and most ambitious yakitori joint.',\n",
       "  \"Remains is the operative word because Tori Shin has been going at it since 2007, when Atsushi (along with owner  Shu Ikeda) set up shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It was a small poultry blip in a pre-crash New York overrun by pork belly, steakhouses, and pan-Asian stadium spots. I started visiting in 2012, not too long after Michelin awarded it a coveted star, and found that Tori Shin was unquestionably serving some of the city's finest (and most expensive) chicken tastings. Problem was, the cramped room felt as inviting as a dragon roll sushi shack. So in June, Atsushi relocated to West 53rd, transforming the ground floor of an apartment building into the more sedate fine dining establishment that Tori Shin always deserved to be, and giving this casual stretch of Hell's Kitchen, peppered with Korean and Japanese pubs, the high-end spot it has long needed.\",\n",

A rectangle of a window overlooks a \"zen garden\" out back; consider it a verdant counterpoint to the gloriously greasy chicken, served in hues of brown, khaki, ochre, and tar. One exception to that color scheme, however, is the tenderloin, grilled to such a creamy white it could seek camouflage in clam chowder. Take a bite. The interior is as rare as barely-cooked tuna. The flavor is faintly chicken-y, while the texture is as silky as kobe beef. Then a whisper of fresh wasabi cleanses the palate.',\n",

Option two is $70 for eight skewers plus small plates, one of which might be rice with scrambled eggs, a wintry end-of-meal preparation that's accompanied by chicken broth as rich as Thanksgiving gravy.

An entry level tasting for two at Tori Shin, after all, will cost less than a large format tomahawk steak at American Cut. That New York can sustain such a restaurant is testament to our increasing tolerance for elevating foods that don\\'t have a deep history of being elevated.

Most of the folks at Buddakan, after all, are better dressed for dancing than dealing with the effects of chile oil splattered on white shirts (spoiler: much everything here is splatter-free).

Since the early days of Northeast Kingdom, this neighborhood’s been the one to watch in Bushwick. Faro is named using a creative spelling of an heirloom grain that has been re-popularized lately. A cousin of wheat comprising several wild species, farro was prized by the ancient Romans. Faro’s unusual formula emphasizes heirloom grains; a wood-burning oven; seasonal produce, boutique meats, and local seafood cooked in that oven; and a supreme dominance of pastas. Take that, carb haters! A few secondi fill out the menu, making the place seem a little more Italian, though it really isn’t. Let’s call it an Italo-hipster hybrid.',\n",

This former sculpture storage space for MoMa is characterized by high ceilings, lots of tables, and a circumferential banquette. There’s a long bar in front, at which you can eat in an orange glow as the sun sets on the murals, metal recycling depots, artists’ lofts, and small manufacturing facilities in the immediate area.',\n",

As the dish sailed in, the appearance was striking: a mass of white foamy whey seething atop a fine-textured brown gruel, with a ring of glinting olive oil splashed around the edges. Dipping down into the depths one pulled up bright green peas like some unidentified swamp plant. The porridge was mellow, the peas almost unspeakably sweet, and the whole thing mind-bogglingly good.',\n",

Now the peas are sadly gone, to be replaced in the porridge by curls of summer squash and a fried squash blossom, offering one of summer’s best crunches. A cold soup of creamed red peppers soon became an even better soup of pureed sweet corn, with delicate fronds of fennel and a tracery of herb oil on top. The wood-burning oven often sees service where vegetables are concerned. Delicate charred asparagus debuted in late spring well-buttered and tossed with crabmeat; Faro is certainly not a place that fears dairy.',\n",

You may have thought yourself tired of beets, but this dish is further amplified with a boiled egg cut in perfect quarters and thin slices of raw-beet carpaccio. I’d pick this any day of the week over the restaurant’s beef tartare, which, despite its zany pickled mustard seeds and shards of crouton, is a bit dull and dry tasting.',\n",

The squid ink calamarati ($17) sees the chef playing a little joke. The recipe deploys a pasta shaped like squid rings, and actual squid ink generates its glossy midnight hue. But it uses no actual squid. The ink makes the pasta richer, an effect that’s goosed up by a sauce of curried coconut milk. We are already in nutsy pasta territory here, but a half lobster tail and claw flopped on top makes the dish even more surreal — it’s a pasta Salvatore Dali might have invented.',\n",

At $10, the pie is cheaper than similar renditions downtown and in Brooklyn, and every bit as good. (In Greenwich Village, Keste charges $16. Lower rents in disparate locations mean cheaper prices.) Another favorite is fichi ($12), flooded with salty gorgonzola and dotted with pancetta and quartered fresh figs that provide a touch of sweetness and spill their seeds onto the white cheese blanket. Damn, these pizzas are good! Seven more are available.',\n",

This stuffed pizza is reminiscent of roadside stands in the Umbrian countryside selling flatbread sandwiches called torta al testo. In fact, many dishes on Bono\\'s menu are attributable to the Italian regions the owners came from.',\n",

The village is known as the hog-butchering capital of Italy, and wonderful salamis, sausages, and cured hams are created there. It is also an area where black summer truffles and porcini mushrooms are found in abundance. All these go together to make Bono\\'s strozzapreti — twisted double-hanks of noodle whose name translates to \"priest stranglers,\" illustrating the humor often found in Italian food.

But whatever region is evoked, Bono tends to get the dishes right.',\n",
       "  \"There are a couple of exceptions, of course. Rather than offering a conventional Caprese salad — one of the world's most perfect preparations — Bono gums things up by adding pesto and grilled peaches to the usual ripe tomatoes, mozzarella, and leaf basil. And there's nothing seemingly Italian about the roasted beet salad with herbed goat cheese, which has become so commonplace on bistro menus it only serves to provoke a yawn. The ribeye steak and roast half chicken were substandard, too: the former because it was overdone and not that great a piece of meat to begin with, the latter because it had a reheated mushiness on the day I tried it.

Chef Daniel Humm, who co-owns the restaurant with front-of-house maestro Will Guidara, had been riffing on poularde en vessie (a French technique in which chicken is steamed in a ballooned bladder) but swapping in vegetables for the poultry: truffled celery root in the winter, asparagus when spring came around. I was at the restaurant in late summer and trying to imagine which seasonal produce might most benefit from a shvitz in a veiny orb. Pattypan squash, maybe?',\n",

Only it was more of a rumination on tomato: a pure-of-flavor tomato mousse covered with a basil scented tomato puree shaped to resemble a cross-section of the fruit, with tomato seeds, croutons, and pickled shallots scattered on top. Right after it, a tin appeared. The geometric patterns on its lid echoed the dining room’s stately Art Deco decor. It contained poached quail egg, bacon gelee, bits of ham, and corn puree resembling hollandaise; all together, they evoked eggs Benedict. A side of miniature English muffins drove home the theme.

Their driving goal: To make every diner blissfully happy, usually through fun, but sometimes through quiet menu and service choices. They’d both worked at the restaurant since 2006. Five years later, they bought the place from their boss, Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group opened it in 1998.

I sighed over a high-elevation Taiwanese oolong, the flavors shifting from vegetal to tropical and the viscosity becoming ever creamier.

But now, nearly a decade later, he's back at it on the ultra-casual front, hawking fiery chicken fingers, porky flatbread pizzas, questionable hamburgers, and crispy Old Bay fries at a little experiment called Fuku+.

The salt levels are more restrained than at Chick-Fil-A, and the heat, a product of a habanero buttermilk brine, is intense but never painful. If you're lucky, you'll get a thick, gelatinous strip of fat on one side of the patty. Ask for daikon slaw to up the tartness factor, but really, the pickles provide sufficient acidity. As for the meat itself? It's neutral. And that's fine. You're not here to appreciate the subtleties of Poulet en Bresse; you're hear to enjoy a neutral conduit for salt and spice.

       " ['Nowadays, if you went looking for a Haitian restaurant you’d probably try Flatbush, Canarsie, or Marine Park. But in the 1960s, the area around 57th Street on Manhattan’s West Side was a Haitian stronghold. The area was called Bois Verna, after a neighborhood in Port-Au-Prince known for its ancient latticed houses. New York’s Bois Verna once boasted bookstores, churches, cafes, and bodegas called petit magasins. One of the only institutions remaining is Le Soleil (\"The Sun\"), a restaurant founded in the early 70s by Rolande Bisserth, cook and owner, on a busy stretch of 10th Avenue just north of 57th, where cabbies and limo drivers often double-parked to hurry in for carry-out.',\n",
       "  'In 2011, a new landlord and rent increase forced the long-running institution to close. But this is the rare restaurant real estate story that has a happy ending, because in 2013, Bisserth triumphantly reopened Le Soleil across the street and down the hill, still on 10th Avenue but now technically in Hell’s Kitchen rather than the Upper West Side. The new premises is far more handsome and well-appointed than the previous one, with peach-colored walls above brown wainscoting, with the same collection of colorful tropical landscapes lining the walls, mainly in the celebrated Haitian Primitive style.',\n",
       "  'The menu at the new place remains pretty much the same as the old one. Divided into two parts, the first lists a core of dishes always available, including the greatest hits of Haitian cuisine; the second offers three to five specials per day that run to Sunday’s beef tongue, Thursday’s guinea hen, and Saturday’s pizzle — bull penis. Approach at your own risk. Not all the specials are available on the days promised, but on any given day you’re likely to find a choice of 10 or so main courses from both parts of the menu, all displaying the same winning mix of French and African elements that characterizes Haitian fare.',\n",
       "  'Each of these set meals starts with a simple salad of tomatoes, lettuce, and cucumbers served with French dressing — you know, the orange, gloppy salad condiment that comes in a bottle. There’s nothing really French about it; how the dressing got to Haiti decades ago and was accepted as Gallic is anybody’s guess. Nevertheless, unless you secretly have a bottle of the stuff stashed in your refrigerator, eating a salad slobbered with it is at least an interesting novelty.',\n",
       "  'Above: Accra fritters; Below: Legumes with beans and rice and beans',\n",
       "  'As an aside, there’s only one appetizer: accra ($1 each). These elongated fritters are made with mashed malanga (aka cocoyam, yautia, or dasheen), a gnarled tuber of the elephant ear plant often seen in Latin groceries. Mixing malanga with black-eyed peas and scallions, these crisp brown fritters develop a creamy gray interior and taste twice as good if you spoon on the hot sauce called piklis, which sits in a jar on the table. Formulated with vinegar, chopped cabbage, and scotch bonnet peppers, it packs a prodigious wallop.',\n",
       "  'The national dish of Haiti is lambi, but many Haitian restaurants in Brooklyn no longer serve it due to spiraling costs. Here it remains king among entrees, though at $20 it’s also the priciest. Known in English as conch, and Italian as scungilli, lambi is the horny creature pulled out of the pink-lipped shell that you hold up to your ear to hear the ocean. The thing takes a lot of tenderizing to be palatable, and Haitian cooks are experts at it. At Le Soleil the shellfish is fricasseed in a vinegary pink solution as beautiful as the shell. It’s probably unlike anything you’ve tasted before and a big raw onion ring rides on top.',\n",
       "  'Other notable entrees include griot ($12), a confit of fatty pork chunks achieved by marinating the meat in sour orange and shallots, boiling them in the marinade until it evaporates, then frying the pork chunks until dark-colored and delicious. The same very French treatment is afforded goat (cabrit), beef (tasso de boeuf), and turkey (tasso dinde) with similar results. Pork is still the best, with turkey second. Love goat? On Wednesday and Sunday, it’s available in an orangish brown gravy (cabrit en sauce, $14).',\n",
       "  'If you’re really famished, go with the red snapper. Like the lambi, it will set you back $20 for a large specimen. The fish is fried head-on and whole, then strewn with onions. For lovers of plain seafood, it’s spectacularly fresh. On the other hand, vegetable adorers will select a dish with the generic-sounding name of legumes ($12). It turns out to be the most African dish of all: a glorious moosh of leafy vegetables stewed with a few carrots and beans, flavored with chunks of beef. Pour on the piklis.',\n",
       "  'Entrees come with rice and peas and a whole boiled plantain at lunch. At dinner you get fried plantains instead of boiled, and djon-djon rice colored an alarming shade of black, not in the Italian manner with squid ink but by boiling the grain with tiny, spindly black mushrooms native to Haiti called djon-djon. These impart color and subtle flavor, but the mushrooms themselves are removed after cooking because they’re too damn tough to eat. The djon-djon rice also contains lima beans.',\n",
       "  'Ultimately, the prime allure of Le Soleil may not be its French or West African elements, but the sheer size and generosity of its app and entrees, and the warmth of the welcome. If you’re a meat and potatoes person who likes plain fare expertly cooked, give the restaurant a try. There’s no way you’ll go away hungry, or much poorer.',\n",

       "  'Hyderabad is the capital of South India’s Andhra Pradesh region. Only twenty years ago this hilly city of seven million on the Musi River was in a state of decline, but recently it has undergone an economic uptick that has transformed the city into a tech powerhouse and kingpin of the call-center industry. (Yes, many of those annoying phone solicitations you get around dinnertime come from Hyderabad.) For a South Indian metropolis, it has an unusual history. Hyderabad’s culinary roots go back to the Muslim Mughal emperors of the North, who conquered Hyderabad in 1724. They brought with them some of their most delectable recipes, including biryani, a lamb-dotted rice casserole inspired by Middle Eastern pilaf — an unusual signature dish for a southern city.',\n",
       "  'You can get indifferent biryani in any of New York’s old-fashioned Punjabi restaurants, usually a greasy mountain of rice shot with tough morsels of meat and more raisins than you can shake a stick at. Often, it’s been desiccating on a steam table for days. Instead, whiz over to Hyderabadi Biryani & Chat, a sole Indian establishment among the Northern Chinese cafes and pizzerias of Kissena Boulevard. The restaurant occupies a boxy room with eight tables in the front and a steam table at the far end — the tubs are filled with things that actually improve with age, like palak paneer and goat masala. The room’s main decoration is a wall-size mural with color photos of the menu, which would make ordering easy if there weren’t so many difficult choices to make at this astonishingly good restaurant.',\n",

Rather than sitting on the steam table and drying out, it is assembled to order with freshly cooked morsels of meat and vegetables. Two of the choices are vegetarian, one also vegan. The rice is kept exceedingly fluffy, delicately flavored with ginger, garlic, and cardamom. The shards of meat, poultry, or seafood are tender, pleasantly fatty, and cut in pieces smaller than usual, the better to hide among the tan, yellow, and orange grains of rice. Deeply brown caramelized onions and bright green chopped cilantro and scallions are heaped on top; a lime wedge is provided on the side to further irrigate and sour the rice. By all means, squeeze it!',\n",
       "  'Maybe not surprisingly if you’re fond of the can-chewing quadruped, goat is a better call than lamb, and cheaper, too ($10.99 vs. $11.99). It’s more pungent and even slightly funky, very flavor-forward. The funniest looking is the egg biryani ($7.99), a vegetarian tour-de-force crowned with ivory ovoid humps of boiled egg. Crush them up roughly and mix them in with the rice before attacking. The most unusual is \"chilli chicken biryani,\" which features boneless poultry fragments colored an alarming shade of red. The chicken comes from Indian-Chinese cuisine (which probably originated in Calcutta’s Chinatown in the 1940s), and this biryani constitutes a fascinating culinary mash-up that you won’t find elsewhere.',\n",
       "  'Goat biryani',\n",
       "  'While the gigantic menu of Hyderabadi Biryani includes dishes from several regions of India, it spotlights several fascinating recipes from Southern Indian states. Best perhaps is Kerala pepper chicken ($9.99) from the southernmost tip of the South Asian landmass, where fish, coconut milk, and banana leaves figure into the everyday fare. This dish, however, deposits chicken in a bright tomato sauce tinged yellow with turmeric and flavored with aniseed and curry leaf, among many other spices. The main flavoring, though, which makes you sweat from the heat as you gobble the curry, is cracked black peppercorns. Using peppercorns rather than chiles indicates that this recipe probably originated before the 16th century, when the Portuguese introduced chiles to India. Not only is Kerala pepper chicken hot and historical, it’s also supremely delicious.',\n",

Another Northern Indian flourish to Hyderabad cuisine is the passion for the yeast-risen flatbreads cooked in the tandoor oven called naans. The café offers seven; most compelling is the wonderful bullet naan ($1.99), which arrives glistening with oil and paved with minced jalapeños. They make the bread glow green and burn the heck out of your mouth. Named after a town on the Afghan-Pakistan frontier, Peshwari naan comes studded with dried fruit and nuts — you could almost eat it as dessert.

The floors are carpeted, the throw pillows are plentiful, and the linens are more comfortable than the sheets you sleep in. It's not a foodie restaurant, it's just a restaurant. I don't say that as an insult – the Michelin star is merited – I say that as a reminder that this isn't a place where chefs double as waiters, where lilliputian proteins hide under canopies of Belgian endive, or where postprandial dollar pizza is a requirement for filling up.

       "  'For many of us who grew up in the tri-state area, eating pizza was not something that happened in what could be considered a \"restaurant,\" and there was no talk of mozzarella di bufala or San Marzano tomatoes. Meals were paid for in cash. The guy at the register always had a Keith Hernandez mustache. And faded pictures of celebrities hung on the walls. The modern consumer of Neapolitan pies, of course, expects more in 2015, though it\\'s unlikely anyone expects precisely how much more is in store at Bruno Pizza in the East Village. Bookshelves hold copies of the world\\'s most serious culinary tomes: Modernist Cuisine. Manresa. Alinea. Tattooed cooks, working underneath lighting bright enough for a double kidney transplant, perform elective surgery on a plate of okra until it looks like a Cy Twombly composition. And bar diners listen, for five minutes at a time, to the Maserati hum of the Pacojet, a $5,000 blender in which all frozen treats are spun.',\n",
       "  '[The pepperoni pizza with ranch dressing.]',\n",
       "  'Bruno is not an old-school pizza place. In fact it has more tricked out tools than some tasting menu venues. Too bad the dopest toy of all is out of sight and downstairs, a Meadows Mills stone burr. The machine grinds wheat berries from a collective farm near Ithaca into fresh flour, which is then used to make the restaurant\\'s nouveau-Neapolitan pies. \"I think there is a lot of flavor potential in fresh flour that gets lost in typical AP flour or ‘00’ flour (the gold standard pizza flour) after it has been processed, bleached, bromated, and after it has sat in a warehouse, a boat, or a store shelf for a while,\" co-owner Demian Repucci writes in an email. This extravagance, along with the wood burning oven, was paid for the 2015 way: through a $30,000 Kickstarter campaign.',\n",
       "  \"Repucci, along with chefs Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, with their nutritional yeast and bee pollen garnishes, really, really, really want you to know they're doing something more exquisite than the other pizza guys. And who can blame them? Pizza, like barbecue, is a white hot foodstuff whose evolution is limited by our own nostalgia, by our allegiance to how we ate it growing up, and by how little we spent on it. Pizza does not yet have its Alex Stupak, a universally recognized subverter, or its Thomas Keller, someone willing to push the refinement factor into the stratosphere.\",\n",
       "  \"Slojkowski and Gulino, who previously ran the set menu Box Kite on St. Marks, are willing to push the pizza envelope a little harder (haute ranch dressing makes an appearance) and place their pies amid a menu of composed dishes that could alone merit a crowd of destination diners. This is why Bruno, despite its flaws, is the most compelling and creative expression of a pizzeria since Roberta's opened in 2008.\",\n",
       "  \"Here's how to make the most of your experience here:\",\n",
       "  '[Local squid with hatch chiles and charred onion; corkscrew pasta with smoked bone marrow, clams, collards.]',\n",
       "  'Going pizza-only is temping, but that would be a mistake at Bruno where the small plates, which look like curated forest canopies or tidal pools, wouldn\\'t feel out of place at Aquavit or a fancy Danish flower shop. Squid, fortified with an aromatic dose of \"ocean-herbal\" sauce, finds its natural shellfish sugars amped up with slices of smoked and charred onion. Then the hatch chiles hit you. Time for a beer. Fairytale eggplant, roasted to the texture of slow-cooked bananas, derives its sweetness from cashew butter, its verdant bitterness from roasted shishitos. If the chefs put it all on bread, they\\'d have an A-grade PB&J. And then there\\'s compressed watermelon with lardo, roasted okra, pickled okra, and poblano emulsion, a sweet-sour-spicy-fatty affair that\\'s straight up Paul Liebrandt — which is to say an outstanding combination of ingredients that no inside-the-box chef would think to put together.',\n",
       "  \"David Chang, an original gangster in serving high-end (yet affordable) food in cramped, noisy spaces, would be proud of the Bruno boys. Surely no other U.S. restaurant utilizes a more painful counter stool. Designed by Repucci himself, they lack both lumbar and pediatric support. Your feet dangle and knock up against the poorly-spaced bar wall, and I'll bet Air Turkmenistan has more legroom than this. The lighting is cafeteria bright, meaning the environs are more conducive to food photos, less so to first dates, or lingering.\",\n",
       "  'You don\\'t tip at Bruno, where servers are paid an hourly wage. Such policies are increasingly common at tasting menu spots like Atera and Brooklyn Fare, but still rare at the casual, a la carte level. Amanda Cohen\\'s affordable Dirt Candy is an exception in that regard, and Repucci\\'s conversations with Cohen informed his decision to do away with gratuities at Bruno. \"We both agreed that tipping is racist, sexist, etc., and doing away with it seemed the best way to simplify things and potentially pay cooks a little more for all their hard work,\" Repucci says. The fairest way to eliminate tipping is by raising prices, a practice that lets diners know how much they\\'ll spend without having to do any mental math. \"But then our prices would be 20 percent higher than everyone else’s.\" Indeed, a service-included policy would push Bruno\\'s margherita pie from $15 to $18. So instead, the restaurant levies a 20 percent administrative fee, which more or less functions as a mandatory tip. Will Bruno eventually go full-on service-included? \"I think eventually, as more restaurants move to no tipping, the consumer’s pricing perception will change and restaurants will be able to just have higher menu prices,\" Repucci says. Right on.',\n",
       "  '[The margherita pie.]',\n",
       "  \"The margherita pie, with mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil, is too often like a Beatles cover band – overly faithful to the original. Bruno tweaks things just a bit. Rounds of Caputo Brothers mozzarella sport a welcome, almost toothsome chew. This isn't milky mush; this is cheese, dammit. Then there's the fruit. The chefs use a blend of fermented and canned tomatoes, with the vine itself steeped into the juice, creating a marked pucker and a distinct vegetal perfume that's aggressively headier than standard pies. A whisper of garlic, a hint of dried clay pepper, and a wallop of basil stimulate and sharpen the palate, cleansing it for more pizza eating. This all lies on top of a gently sweet whole wheat crust the thickness of two credit cards, with just a hint of droopiness and – as is increasingly common in New York – no Neapolitan-style soupiness. It's as close to margherita perfection as I've encountered in over a decade.\",\n",
       "  'If it\\'s in season, try the country and peach pie, a clever sweet-savory combination that function as a Southern take on a pineapple-spiked \"Hawaiian\" pie. Or do the salad pie, which employs bottarga-topped, dressing-slicked greens as a samurai sword to cut the sugars of roasted cherry tomatoes and the fat of milky ricotta. Lamb pie, covered in coppa, is a clean expression of farmland funk. Pepperoni pie, in turn, introduces a wild card into the mix: ranch dressing, a high-end take on the fringe movement that involves Americans dunking their hot pizza in cool, spiced buttermilk. At Bruno, the effort is more subtle: the ranch is an elegant finishing touch, something to gently reduce the tang of the tomato, with a clean dill-infusion playing foil the porky sausage.',\n",

       " [\"Amid our verdant culinary era where steaks are often made out of cauliflower, where veggie burgers are increasingly the burgers of choice, and where bacon isn't so much a porky slab as a tiny lardon at the bottom of a soup bowl, it’s sometimes hard not to look back upon the artery-clogged aughts with nostalgia. Those were the heady days when chefs of all stripes popularized techniques that made unhealthy foods unhealthier. Crif Dogs championed the deep-fried frankfurter. Per Se, using an old Alain Ducasse hack, folded whipped cream into its cheese-y risottos. Resto won accolades by smearing grilled cheese sandwiches with bechamel, swine belly, and aioli, while DB Bistro skyrocketed to stardom by stuffing its burger with foie gras. Sure, many of those dishes are still popular; it’s just that they're no longer at the heart of our leaner, quinoa-spiked zeitgeist. But rest assured, there are rebels hovering at the fringes, waiting to push the envelope in a meatier, fattier direction. Among the members of that clever minority is Oiji in the East Village, a beefy little Korean restaurant dishing out rice and potato chips that taste like they were larded up by a Michelin-starred amusement park chef.\",\n",
       "  'Let’s start with the what Oiji\\'s menu calls \"buttered rice,\" an understatement that evokes a Rockwell-esque image of dairy fat melting over simple white grains. As if! The kitchen takes cooked rice and fully soaks it in warm butter. Then, during service, the starch is toasted with beef braising liquid and a richer French butter. The flavor is startling; it recalls a cleaner version of the delicious yellow goo with which you douse your movie theater popcorn. On top of the firm grains lie a poached egg and a few slices of braised beef shank, packing a concentrated, bovine punch. It\\'s all a gourmet version of the classic jang-jo-rim, a dish more commonly found in Korean school lunchboxes than a high-end restaurant. Order it.',\n",

It\\'s a sweet, salty, crunchy side dish that essentially functions as the restaurant’s only dessert. Think of the candy-like crisps as a lighter, more uncomplicated answer to baklava, with the tuber acting as a fine stand-in for phyllo. A rep tells me that Oiji \"can hardly keep up with demand\" for the confection, which is based off of a mass-produced snack that spawned a Cronut-like craze in Korea this year. A small bag of those in-demand chips will cost $9 on eBay. At Oiji, they\\'re $5.',\n",

Chefs Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, who trained at Gramercy Tavern and Bouley, respectively, have challenged themselves to refine the comfort food of their native Seoul and beyond. In doing so, they've made Oiji one of the most exhilarating openings of 2015, not to mention one of the city's finest modern Korean restaurants.\",\n",

David Chang’s Momofuku empire, while largely a collection eclectic American restaurants, deserves credit in this regard, for introducing a certain class of food-crazed Westerners to the joys of eating lettuce-wrapped pork, and for proving that large-format Korean fried chicken can merit luxury status with a $135 price tag. Then there’s Hooni Kim’s Danji and Hanjan, two trendsetters whose non-GMO meats command sizable crowds and higher prices than the cheaper commodity fare one finds in certain K-town restaurants. And the fact that the two-Michelin-starred Jungsik is still open proves that at least some folks are willing to spend $180 on Korean tasting menus. So while New York has maintained a somewhat complicated relationship with high-end Chinese or Mexican fare in recent years, the city has generally accepted ambitious, creative Korean cuisine with slightly more open arms.',\n",

       "  \"\\n  The most compelling time to dine at Fore Street — long the grand dame of Portland, Maine’s ever-more-dynamic dining scene — is in the fall. I first ate at Fore Street last August and thoroughly appreciated my dinner, though I’ll confess that I didn’t quite grasp its legendary status. I remember salads electric with summer freshness and local seafood and meats brightened by the sunny hues of tomatoes, corn, stone fruits, and singular Maine blueberries. Every bite earnestly conveyed New England's high-season bounty. But in the same way that dining downstairs at Berkeley’s Chez Panisse can be simple to the point of dullness, the fish entrees and desserts in particular at Fore Street came off a little dozy. \\n  \",\n",
       "  'I returned to Fore Street last month, and this time my appreciation deepened to adoration. Every aspect of the food and atmosphere resonated with the precise moment in the calendar. Walking in, the signature scents of spit-roasting chicken and steaks sputtering over the grill tempted profoundly. The dining room — a collage of timeworn, mismatched bricks and woods in a former warehouse — felt like shelter designed to ward off the spiraling temperatures. ',\n",
       "  'October’s gingered carrot purees, sweet potato and sage gratin, and savory apple griddlecakes matched the grilled and roasted meats and seafood with more elemental oomph. Even a chilled seafood plate seemed designed to thaw moods and bodies with its uplifting flavors: It included plump smoked mussels and the last of the season’s lobster (poached and served with garlic aioli) fished from Casco Bay viewed out the restaurant’s windows. A hunk of pork loin cut as thick as filet mignon satisfied with the complexity of a great steak, its charred and peppery edges giving way to gutsy meat. The twang of garlicky red cabbage sauerkraut beneath the pork made for an ideal autumnal grace note.',\n",

       "  \"Finding Fore Street to be at its most spiritually attuned was just one of the deep pleasures of visiting Portland in the fall. As seasons go, it is nearly impossible to compete with Maine’s summer: the mild temperatures, the diverse topography at its greenest, the jutting coastline dotted with lobster shacks that go dormant as the foliage begins preening. The dropping thermometer and lack of crustacean temptations along the shoreline meant that it was easier to hunker down in Portland, especially before the snow moves in to bury its picturesque roadways. With the exception of Fore Street (where one should book two months in advance to avoid agonizing waits for a place at the bar or in the dining room's unreserved section), reservations are easier to snag most places this time of year.\",\n",
       "  'Given its favor as a vacation destination, it’s widely known that the town has an astounding breadth of quality restaurants. And the options only keep growing broader and better. It is Maine’s largest city, though the population of the town proper only numbers around 67,000. In my 16 months of near-constant travel for Eater, I’ve yet to encounter a U.S. metropolis of its modest size where I eat more superbly.',\n",

       "  'Sam Hayward energized Portland dining when he and his partners opened Fore Street in 1996. He is among the pioneering chefs who began forging close ties with local farmers, fishermen, and other producers. Rob Evans, who had cooked at The French Laundry and Virginia’s equally luxe Inn at Little Washington, furthered the town’s burgeoning reputation when he took over laidback Hugo’s (perched on a prominent corner two blocks from Fore Street) in 1999 and gave it a high-end makeover. Evans differentiated himself from Hayward’s rustic straightforwardness with sous-vide playfulness and Maine ingredients sometimes accented with European or Asian flavors. Generations of Portland cooks trained in these two kitchens.',\n",
       "  'Almost two decades later, it is Portland’s array of cuisines from around the globe that astounds. It speaks to the sophisticated palates of food-savvy residents and visitors alike that so many of them serve such remarkably accomplished cooking. At Japanese restaurant Miyake, customers graze on small plates like tai snapper braised in dashi, sake, and ginger, or they settle in for a $70 omakase of sushi, sashimi, and dishes such as grilled uni or seared duck breast that would easily cost three figures in a larger city. At upscale-ish Greek stalwart Emilitsa, even a crowd-pleaser like chicken souvlaki is finely tuned: The rice pilaf underneath tingles with just the right amount of lemon juice. I’m still hoping that the Sicilian street snacks and billowy flatbreads like the\\xa0ones served at Slab (which opened last year) catch on as national trends. I’m sorry I missed the sambusas and stewed cassava leaves at Chez Okapi, a Congolese restaurant that opened the week I was in town.',\n",

       "  'But I did make it to Tempo Dulu, a white-tablecloth restaurant serving Southeast Asian tasting menus that launched in June in the newly renovated Danforth Inn, a mansion built in 1823. Dutch owners Raymond Brunyanszki and Oscar Verest went all in on the decor: edgy contemporary art, plush banquettes, extravagant flower arrangements. There are three options for dinner: a three-course menu for $67, a five-course meditation on lobster for $98, or (the one that most intrigued me) an $87 variation on Indonesian rijsttafel, the \"rice table\" tradition that developed during the 300 years that the Dutch ruled over Indonesia. Rijsttafel lives on most prominently these days as a specialty of Amsterdam\\'s restaurant scene.',\n",

       "  \"At Tempo Dulu, the meal began with green papaya soup and lobster spring rolls. Then the straight-backed servers marched out the main event: a spread of nearly a dozen dishes arranged in small bowls, including plenty of rice and the fiery condiment called sambal. Halibut steamed to suppleness in a banana leaf was the centerpiece. Chicken satay had a caramelized crispness that lifted the dish from its usual blandness. Only coconut-sluiced beef rendang disappointed; an overdose of lemongrass obliterated every other flavor. Few rijsttafel restaurants exist in the U.S., and the sense of giddy abundance worked in the posh surroundings. And at this time of year, the food's tropical sultriness whisks away the palate to warmer climes. If the splurge for dinner doesn’t appeal, at least swing by the bar to ogle the furnishings (especially the chandelier covered in what appears to be moss) and to savor the cocktails (tiki-esque but light on cloying sweetness) by Trevin Hutchins, one of the city’s most lauded bartenders.\",\n",
       "  'The current richness of Portland’s culinary landscape — the cherished Maine ingredients mingled with the international reach of its dining options — manifests most rewardingly in the three restaurants owned by Arlin Smith, Mike Wiley, and Andrew Taylor. In 2012 the trio purchased Hugo’s from Rob Evans. They had been overseeing the restaurant as Evans began concentrating on Duckfat, a runaway success specializing in Belgian fries and sandwiches that Evans opened in 2005 with his wife, Nancy Pugh. The same year that Smith, Wiley, and Taylor bought Hugo’s they also took over the space next door to Hugo’s to create Eventide Oyster Co., a bar that muddles foods from Maine and \"from away\" in dazzling mash-ups: Pemaquid oysters glossed with kimchee or pickled ginger ices, a classic New England clam bake alongside green curry lobster stew, peekytoe crab rolls next to fried chicken buns topped with pickled watermelon.',\n",
       "  'And this past April, on the other side of Eventide, the three of them launched The Honey Paw, a casual hangout serving homemade pan-Asian noodles and other globetrotting comforts.

(Crowds still occasionally spill out the door in the fall; go early or late.) That said, I enjoyed the other two restaurants mightily on this trip. The Honey Paw struck me as a restaurant that will be deeply useful to its community, a place to stop in solo for a lunchtime lobster tartine (beautiful with its blanket of radishes and hijiki seaweed and celery leaves) or for sharing bowls of Thai khao soi (potent with smoked lamb, coconut curry broth, fermented greens, and fried noodles) when winter descends. The lists of craft beer and unusual wines come off as skillfully calibrated as the food.',\n",

Categories of dishes focusing on meats, seafood, and vegetables define the menu, with diners encouraged to mix and match from each section to create two-, three-, or five-course meals. Choosing a volley of contrasting proteins paid off: fluke cured in umeboshi (pickled plum-like Japanese fruits) with translucent apple slices and crackly rice puffs segued to a hearty salad of duck tenderloin, gizzards, and liver punchy with mustard vinaigrette and then to gently smoked cod over potato puree and a clever, pleasantly rough sambal made from tomato skins. Taken together, the group’s restaurants capture Portland’s specific strengths — a mingling of cherished Maine ingredients with a port city’s receptivity toward international influences.',\n",

The attention has made a seat at the restaurant (which doesn’t take reservations) nearly as hard to claim as at Fore Street. A friend and I arrived at 6 p.m. to be told the small dining room had just filled and the wait could easily stretch to over an hour.',\n",
       "  'We returned for lunch next day instead. The noontime offerings were a truncated version of chef Christopher Gould’s evening menu but still provided a gratifying tour of his signatures (with a table available immediately). We eased in with the bread and butter, a deceptively banal name for a dish that includes a white beer sabayon whizzed through an aerosol dispenser into the shape of a giant, tremulous egg yolk set over hazelnut butter. Spicy beef salad jolted with Sriracha; roasted bone marrow with horseradish delivered fatty, pungent happiness. The Bluefin tuna crudo, presented as tidily stacked dominoes with radish and mustard and sesame seeds, reminded me that I’d seen the fish at a surprising number of restaurants in Portland. I’ve certainly noticed its presence dwindling across the country in light of overfishing and its endangered status. But the restaurant receives the fish from the city’s Browne Trading Company, one of America’s most respected seafood purveyors. It sells fish caught wild from the Gulf of Maine, in limited catches and in season from June to October. At lunch that day Gould also had a plucky open-face tuna melt on the menu, a smart way to use the leftover fish.',\n",

To savor it means leaving behind Portland’s cobblestone streets for a 20-mile drive south to the town of Biddeford. Last month the trees along I-95 practically lit the highway in their blaze of yellows and crimsons. By now their branches will be stark. Biddeford still merits the short jaunt, for both Palace Diner and for Rabelais, a national treasure of a cookbook store that specializes in out-of-print and rare tomes, some of which are hundreds of years old. Owners Don and Samantha Lindgren frequently travel at this time of year, so call ahead to make an appointment, even simply to browse or buy the latest Ottolenghi cookbook. ',\n",

For breakfast, make it the deluxe sandwich, a beguiling combination of egg, bacon, cheddar, and jalapeño on English muffin that chefs and co-owners Chad Conley and Gregory Mitchell somehow elevate beyond the sum of its parts. Around 12 o’clock, order the tuna melt or the Palais Royale, a double cheeseburger stacked with patties griddled until the edges crisp. Hell, the restaurant also serves the Palais Royale at 8 a.m. Go for it.

These shops, which numbered in the hundreds, were often run by Iranis, a group that had emigrated from Persia in the late 19th century. By the mid-20th century, the teahouses already had a worn colonial air, furnished with bent-cane chairs, high ceilings, giant blemished mirrors, and lazy ceiling fans, something like New York’s older French bistros. A place for friends to meet in advance of a movie or after a shopping spree, Irani cafes furnished Bombayites with a quick cup of chai and a plate of English biscuits long before the era of fast food. They also offered larger meals that constituted a mash up of Indian, Persian, English, and Portuguese influences.',\n",
       "  'Riding a wave of nostalgia, Irani cafes have recently re-emerged as a fad in other Indian cities like Delhi and Hyderabad, while a handful of much older establishments remain in Mumbai. Now, miraculously, one has appeared in Jersey City. It occupies the former Paratha Junction space on bustling Newark Avenue, the most important Indian shopping street in the metropolitan area. The color scheme is black and red; ladder-back chairs surround lacquered tables, and squarish sconces march along walls covered with cartoons and drawings. A window at shoulder height looks into a kitchen a half-floor higher, approached via a stunted stairway. Nevertheless, the place doesn’t go very far in evoking the décor of an Irani café back in India.',\n",
       "  'The place is run by a gentleman with the canine nickname of Fido; wearing a fez, he smiles down at you from the outside awning and will occasionally pop into the dining room in person to see how you’re enjoying your cup of chai. That Indian milk tea comes in four varieties. Irani chai ($3) is the signature, made with sweetened condensed milk and heavily scented with cardamom. It’s irresistible, if you like your tea thick and sugary. In the early 20th century, this version was reputedly sometimes doctored with opium, made possible by Persia’s primacy in the poppy trade. Fido’s Irani chai, alas, doesn’t contain any drugs.',\n",

It means something more like \"buttered up,\" meaning that the sheer quantity of butter is supposed to flatter you.

       "  \"Beverage guru Nancy Cushman and chef Tim Cushman have given New York one of its most expensive new restaurants since Per Se and Masa opened in the Time Warner Center over a decade ago, and they've tucked it into one of the city's most affordable culinary districts. Naysayers will mourn this as yet another example of how unfettered extravagance is spreading through the four corners of our five boroughs, and indeed it would be sad if Hermes outlets started replacing Indian sweet shops in the East 20s. But until that happens, I'll argue that an excellent fine-dining institution (which this mostly is) in an unexpected location can serve as a boon to the community. \",\n",

       "  'Hamachi with banana pepper mousse and foie gras balsamic chocolate kabayki',\n",
       "  \"O Ya, like the Boston original, is a sedate rectangle of a room, boasting exposed brick walls, a wonderfully eclectic playlist (Gorrilaz, Butthole Surfers, Chicano Batman, Taj Mahal), and a 16-seat walnut bar that's nearly as smooth as those 500-year-old Hinoki wood slabs that certain critics rave about like they're Lamborghinis. Smart diners will ask for seats at that counter and avoid the tables. Sushi, after all, is a performance art, and because each morsel is so small and ephemeral, much of the enjoyment comes from the build-up, from watching a chef slice the cool fish, anneal it, in an almost magical slight of hand, to a mound of warm vinegared rice, and place it in front of the guest. Good raw fish joints are compact enough to allow such spectating and interaction, while at larger ones, the chef will often reposition himself in front of the intended recipients.\",\n",
       "  \"That visual luxury, alas, isn't guaranteed at O Ya. Those sitting at the north side of the counter often won't see anything until a slice of hamachi with banana pepper mousse appears on a plate delivered by the server. It will still be delicious, with the pepper cutting through the fattiness of the rich fish. But it's sushi that's missing half its narrative, an admittedly nitpicky issue that nonetheless feels amplified at these prices. So the key is to request a seat at the south side of the bar, closer to where the action takes place.\",\n",
       "  \"New restaurants typically price themselves a few dollars less than their more experienced peers, as an enticement to hesitant diners and as a general act of deference as they work any kinks of their system. Then there's O Ya, which, when it opened in June, instantly become New York's third most expensive sushi spot after Masa and Kurumazushi. It also happens to be pricier than Le Bernardin, New York's most heralded seafood restaurant. That's bold, baby.\",\n",

That means dinner for two, after tax and tip will run anywhere from $477-$722. Add on pairings and you're at just under $1,000. And while that's less than what you'll spend in Boston, where the longer menu is $285, O Ya is still markedly spendier than in vogue sushi spots like Nakazawa ($150) or Shuko ($135-$175). So the million dollar question is whether O Ya is worth it. The answer is: It depends. While the restaurant isn't necessarily more accomplished than its cheaper competitors, it does enough things differently enough, and with enough skill, to merit the attention of any die hard Japanese restaurant aficionado.\",\n",

There were no shaved foie gras spoons or shots of tomato shiso kombu water, two of the longer menu\\'s more whimsical intermezzos, nor was there a proper mignardises service, a highlight of the $245 offering.

Once a small mall, it’s a multi-leveled, disproportionate construct plastered with white stucco and all but windowless. Without the restaurant\\'s sign out front it could be mistaken for a distribution center or a sound stage. In the foyer, gilded padding wraps around stairway rails and an antique bust sits near an ornate chair that could double, in a pinch, as a throne. Painted portraits hang on a craggy white brick, doused in eerie light from wrought-iron fixtures across the room that reflect the glow of scarlet wallpaper. It looks like a mash-up of sets from True Blood and Penny Dreadful with bonus inspiration from Amsterdam’s Red Light district.

There will be slabs of beef cut from the short loin and tenderloin, potatoes in myriad guises, and outlandish desserts for which no one saves room. Eating at a chophouse is America’s most universal ritual for indulgence. We go to broker deals or to celebrate and live large, even if we wince at the credit card receipt the next morning. Yet the steakhouse’s basic blueprint provides plenty of freedom for individual expression. Yesteryear’s carnivorous dens like Keens and Peter Luger in New York or London Chop House in Detroit cleave to tradition, their clubby machismo inseparable from their menus. Head-of-the-class reinventions such as Wolfgang Puck’s Cut in Los Angeles and Las Vegas or David Burke’s Primehouse in Chicago infuse the genre with celebrity-chef personality; virtuoso seafood starters and slick rooms reframe the steak dinner in modern contexts.

Bern and Gert Laxer moved from Manhattan to Tampa in the early 1950s, wading into the restaurant business by first running a luncheonette until they bought a place called the Beer Haven in a retail complex in 1956. They started their steakhouse with Bern overseeing the kitchen and Gert running the floor. One by one, the Laxers bought the other businesses around them as they grew their restaurant to a 350-seat behemoth. ',\n",
       "  'Bern was a shrewd tinkerer who nurtured obsessions and found ways to incorporate his fixations into the steakhouse — particularly when it came to wine. He purchased so many cases that he eventually bought warehouse space in the neighborhood for storage. At its zenith, the wine list was 2,000 pages long. ',\n",
       "  'An auto accident forced Bern to retire in 1993 (he died in 2002); Bern and Gert’s son, David, took over the business. David, proving his own entrepreneurial know-how, expanded on the brand by opening a second and more casual restaurant, Sidebern’s, in 1996. It was recently remodeled and renamed Haven, focusing on small plates and a extensive cheese program. And in 2013 he opened the Epicurean hotel — with a cooking classroom and an eclectic American restaurant called Elevage — right across the street from Bern’s. ',\n",

The wine program alone remains a thrilling pilgrimage for oenophiles. I don’t know of a more profound selection in America. The tome has been pared down to around 200 manageable pages, with lists of marquee producers from around the world, many offering vertical vintages that go back fifty years or more. For most of us, it’s too much to take in. The sommeliers, fortunately, are champs: They’ll zero in on your interests and budget and yield something majestic. I love white Burgundy and was prepared for a splurge (a modest one; there are five-figure reds in Bern’s cellar). The somm brought us a 1983 Mersault for $125 that tasted at first of lemon and butter and then something richer, almost like melted cheese on toast. Happiness. ',\n",

Shellfish stands out among the starters, with familiar pleasures like a Maine lobster cocktail, formed into a tower and surrounded by strange moats of mashed avocado that taste better than they look, and grilled shrimp over creamed corn and beurre blanc. There are 20 caviar variations (whitefish roe for $25 per ounce all the way up to $190 Osetra) and a charming, throwback Caesar salad prepared tableside. Seven cuts of steak dry-age in-house and ordering each involves a thorough discussion: How thick would you like your steak? To what degree of doneness, and how heavy on the charred crust? (A chart lays out all the options and corresponding cooking times.) Another relic from restaurant culture of yore: French onion soup (not worth filling up on), a basic salad, a baked potato, onion rings, and a daily changing selection of vegetables all come with the entree. But plenty of upgrade side dishes — creamed spinach with leeks, potatoes fried or mashed, truffle-laced creamed corn — tempt with their more refined preparations.',\n",

A Delmonico (aka ribeye) afforded the classic marbled pleasure, but I slightly preferred the porterhouse, which includes both filet and New York strip sections. The aging sharpened the meat’s individual qualities; the filet was taut rather than flabby and the strip, while not quite reaching blue-cheese funkiness, expressed fathoms of mineral tang. ',\n",
       "  'Dessert brought the themes of the evening full circle. We paid our bill (which includes a 12 percent service charge; that can slip by after several glasses of Burgundy) and then joined other guests for a tour of the kitchen and, more memorably, the tight, packed wine cellar, where we glimpsed bottles of Port and Madeira from the 1800s. Then it was up a flight of stairs for the finale: sweets in the Harry Waugh Dessert Room, named for Bern Laxer’s friend who was previously the director of Chateau Latour. The whole floor comprises 48 booths made of redwood wine casks; each table has a retro sound system you can tune to a variety of musical styles, including, naturally, a live pianist taking requests by phones attached to the stereo.

It was already America’s most influential restaurant, the one where contemporary ideas about fresh, local, and farm-driven were first hatched. Waxman exited Berkeley and went downstate in 1979 to help found Michael’s in Santa Monica, one of L.A.’s most revered restaurants of the era. If you want to know what those early days were like, read Ruth Reichl’s Comfort Me with Apples, in which Waxman figures prominently. But these were mere prelude to what was to follow — his departure for New York in 1984, taking the seeds of the cuisine he helped create with him, and planting them in the rich soil of the restaurant scene here during one of its most opulent periods.',\n",
       "  'Founded in 1984, Jams was an instant hit, capturing not only the essence of California cuisine, but its insouciance, as well. The centerpiece was a grilled chicken-and-fries entrée that shocked everyone with its price tag of $23, but additionally causing a sensation were red snapper ceviche, crab cakes with corn-and-tomato salsa, and, especially, tiny pancakes served with smoked salmon, crème fraiche, and yellow whitefish caviar. New York had never seen a restaurant quite like Jams, causing Bryan Miller to coo in the Times, \"Of all of the trends that have sprouted in New York City in recent years, however fleeting, one that has thrown strong roots and become part of the landscape is so-called California cuisine.\"',\n",
       "  'On this wave of approbation, Waxman opened two more restaurants in New York and another Jams in London. Then came the stock market crash of 1987, and suddenly high-rollers with expense account money drifted away, and Waxman’s empire was wiped out in the blink of an eye. The peripatetic chef returned to L.A. for a while, then reappeared in New York, where he worked behind the scenes on several restaurants without much visibility. At times he seemed only partly engaged in his restaurant career, staying out of the spotlight for years at a time.',\n",
       "  'Finally, his fans cheering on the sidelines, he dove into the pool again, opening Washington Square Park in 2002 on Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village.

Not only did models mince down the adjacent ramp from the overhead studios, they were seated among us in skimpy dresses, their lips glinting with lip gloss.

When the place first opened, the bearded and curly headed Waxman was to be seen wrangling poultry. Served with an Italian salsa verde redolent of anchovies and capers, the half chicken is every bit as good as it ever was, perhaps better.

This is Italian cooking with a California twist, a cuisine that L.A. chefs like Nancy Silverton, Wolfgang Puck, and Mark Peel (one of Waxman’s associates at Michael’s) have been exploring for decades, and one to which Waxman has added impressive innovations of his own.',\n",
       "  'Yes, over the years Barbuto has only gotten better, with a practiced crew in both the front and back of the house who have learned every trick to what makes a restaurant great. And the recent sale of Industria Studios, leaving the fate of Barbuto up the in air, means making what may be a last visit only more imperative.

The high-ceilinged room is attractively lined with wood and hung with Edison light bulbs, and the chairs that surround a multiplicity of square tables have a groovy 60s feel to them.

Our tastes have collectively changed since then, principally through the incorporation of culinary principles espoused by Waxman and his California pals 30 years ago, now incorporated into every menu in town and become keystones of the foodie philosophy. Soon after Jams 2.0 opened, I sat there with a bunch of colleagues from Eater (including three critics, who managed to remain anonymous) and pondered this truth, as we ate our way around the menu. We paid special attention to the handful of dishes that had been transferred nearly intact from the original menu at Jams.',\n",

More than once we endured a 30-minute interval with no food brought out at all. The dishes readily divided themselves into good and awful. An ample bacon cheeseburger ($21), named after the restaurant and listed as a bar snack, was fat and juicy and required frequent visits to the cloth napkin, while an oblong pesto-and-goat cheese mini-pizza tasted more Greek than Italian; it was delicious, though, with its smoky crust. Squid ink rigatoni with crabmeat was too al dente, the underdressed noodles black and glistening with not enough crustacean. The worst dish of 11 sampled was a bone-in pork chop cooked like wiener schnitzel, overcooked, really, into an almost-burned toughness.

The tiny pork belly tacos ($19), though, were thoroughly delicious — accompanied by one teacup of smashed avocado and another of pico di gallo made with perfect ripe tomatoes. The biggest disappointment was an entrée called mezze ($23), which connotes a set of Greek or Middle Eastern starters that often include baba ganoush, hummus, and tabbouleh.

Back then potable drinking water was a pipe dream, so Belgian farmers brewed beer (primarily during winter, when the risk of infected batches was lower) that handled farmhands’ thirst during the hot harvest season.

Pounded and breaded, it splayed across the plate resembling a three-dimensional map of a small country with ragged borders.

And the kitchens of yore produced place-specific creations that are wholly delectable and adaptable: the Colonial cornmeal souffle of sorts called spoonbread, for example.

A similar mixture gives the famous fried chicken at Watershed in Atlanta its distinctive porky savor; Lewis developed the recipe with her protégé Scott Peacock, who was the chef at Watershed for a decade.

Walter, who died in 1998, was also a culinary historian who penned the joys of bourbon cocktails 20 years before the recent revival and studied 19th-century recipes full of spices like fenugreek that arrived via Mobile’s lively port trade.

It resides in the small town of Spruce Pine about an hour northeast from Asheville in the thick of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Spruce Pine’s population is below 2,500. As I drove into town a fire (burning trash?) smoldered by the curving train tracks across from the restaurant. It was a Wednesday in early May; the spare dining room (sage and green walls, chairs with wicker backs around simple wooden tables) was nearly empty. Most of the diners had instead gathered around smoky gray picnic tables on the restaurant’s garden patio.',\n",

Allen cooked for 10 years in Los Angeles at restaurants like A.O.C. and as a private chef for Hollywood stars whose identities he won’t confirm (his rumored clients included Reese Witherspoon and Tobey Maguire). In 2009 he and his then-wife Wendy relocated from California to be closer to her family in western North Carolina, where Allen also has relatives. As a cook, Allen had been yearning for a climate more closely tied to actual shifting seasons. Selling alcohol in restaurants had just become legal in Spruce Pine that year.

But over time his cuisine has evolved into a more modern and personal expression: He might fold in global nuances, but the ingredients largely hail from the region, most strikingly in the form of wild fauna that liberally peppers his dishes. The staff could easily present field guides along with the menus.

He enthused about how the sturdy, sharp green known as stonecrop holds up to heat as a finishing touch to rabbit loin with black radish and ramps. He rhapsodized over the slight nuttiness of an herb called Solomon’s plume served alongside zippy sochan, another springtime green, to accompany our grilled pork chop. Often the leafy additions are as much for the eye as for the palate: A slice of washed wind tomme from Vermont (Allen allows himself shipments of cheese from Murray’s in New York) came camouflaged among tender spruce tips, lemony sumac, and wood violets. Talk to him long enough about his work and the conversation takes on spiritual shadings: \"The more I discovered what grew and when it grew, I saw that the hills will take care of you if you stop, look, and listen.

He put the vertebrae of the cleaned trout through the wringer — pressure-canning them, blending them in the Vitamix, mixing them with agar agar to set, whirring them again — until, infused with cream and wine, they tasted like spreadable chowder.

       " [\"When seeking culinary inspiration back in the mid-aughts, I'd often ride the polished escalators up to the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center and peruse the daily menus at Per Se, ogling dishes that lucky guests would enjoy in the cushy, coddled, quiet dining room. The preparation that fascinated me most of all was a 48-hour brisket; I’d heard Thomas Keller was doing cool things with sous-vide cookery, creating the possibility of magical medium-rare braises, imparting fascinating color and textural contrasts to cuts that should've come out uniformly brown. How did the meat taste? Couldn’t tell you. The $210, service-included price (before supplements), was too high for this young writer. So it wasn't until a few years later that I got my fix, not at Per Se but at David Chang’s $85 Momofuku Ko, where a high-tech water bath treatment left my short ribs gorgeously pink. There were no supplements at Ko. There was also no coddling. The setting was a cramped East Village counter. The first course was a pork rind. And the entertainment was listening to chefs drop f-bombs as they sent the last course – McDonald’s-style apple pies – into the deep fryer. It was all very punk rock.\",\n",
       "  \"The setting was all enough to let you know you weren't meditating in the prayer room at Masa. Ko, which Chang opened in his old Noodle Bar space in 2008, was an unambiguous birdie flip to the expense account pomp of haute gastronomy.

One can only play human Tetris while heading to the restroom so many times. So last November, Chang moved his flagship tasting spot to a 23-seat counter space just off The Bowery, a neighborhood that, in its present incarnation, is the precise opposite of punk rock; Ko’s neighbors are an art gallery and an apartment complex where studios start at $3,600/month. And with the new location came a $50 price hike, pushing the dinner menu to $175, which is what Ko used to charge for its extended lunch service. Momofuku raised the course count as well, bringing it up to around 18 servings.',\n",

Edward McCrady completed the construction of his tavern in 1778; George Washington reportedly drank his fill of ale in its second-floor banquet room.

Further investigation reveals that Puebla De Los Angeles was the original name of Puebla, the capital and largest city in the state of Puebla. (By comparison, the original name of Los Angeles, California was El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles de Porciúncula. The early Spaniards had a way with place names.)',\n",

Eat it with the country’s famous red rice ($1.99), nutty tasting and here mixed with basmati, or with tingmo ($1.50), a delightful steamed bread tied in a big knot like a weight lifter’s shoulder.

The thin branches are burned as incense in Buddhist temples for its pungent aroma. The bark, when distilled into a medicinal decoction, is purported to fight chronic dysentery, male infertility, gonorrhea, and flatulence. But most prized of all are the tree’s purple, oblong leaves. They harken the arrival of spring in China in the same way that ramps do for certain segments of the American population. The tender toon leaf, or xiangchun as it's called in Mandarin, contains an essence of garlic so ethereal that the wannabe allium is safe to consume before intimate encounters. So if you’re reading this in May, you're in luck: It’s toon season.\",\n",
       "  'As luck would have it, that backyard in Yonkers belongs to the family of chef Jonathan Wu. The Bronx-born Per Se alum harvests the toon leaves himself and serves them at Fung Tu, his envelope-pushing year-and-a-half-old restaurant on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Chinese cooks traditionally stir fry the leaves with eggs. Wu, in a nod to that preparation, uses them to garnish airy ile flottantes scented with smoked fish broth; the delicate sting of the leaves acts as an antidote to the umami-rich fumet. It’s a lot of flavor for a dish that sits on the tongue with as much heaviness as a spray of cologne.',\n",

But the good news is that Fung Tu has since evolved into one of the city’s most compelling destinations for Chinese-American cooking, boasting cleaner flavors and spicier food than in its early days.

He stuffs fatty pork belly into an egg roll but keeps the richness in check via something unexpected: the salty bitterness of olives. He takes a fluff-tacular bowl of brisket fried rice and finishes it with pomegranate seeds, adding a juicy, Sephardic counterpoint to the heady meat. And he pays homage to the classic softness of dan dan noodles with a German twist; he douses spaetzle in a bitter and fragrant Sichuan pork sauce. If the texture recalls Chef Boyardee a bit too much, just think of it as a spicy porridge and deal with it.',\n",

In the early days, Kevin, the chef, sent out maple syrup-spiked pastrami (better than Katz\\'s), grilled cod collar (nicely fatty), and best of all, raw hamachi with trout roe and jalapeno — a dish imbued with so much oil and heat it tasted like what would happen if a Michelin-starred chef took over Guy Fieri’s test kitchen.

The combination is so startling that David Chang could serve it at Momofuku Ko and watch a flurry of think pieces roll in on the blogosphere.

What was was once a multi-million dollar mainstay, generally confined to better-heeled parts of town and packed with pricey supplements (or infinite prix fixe options), is now more recognizable in its post-recession iteration: a pared-down, smaller-staffed, single room hangout on the city’s lower-rent fringes. The modern set menu venue is populated by cooks whose names you might not recognize; they didn't rise to chef de cuisine at Per Se or Cafe Boulud before striking out on their own.

The first time I tried it, the creation was unambiguously delicious and straightforward enough to serve at a football party.

And during my final meal, I detected yet another layer of flavor, this one the flatulent funk of cabbage, like a dry-aged piece of beef disguised as a vegetable (the chef tells me he brushes the leaves with duck fat, which hikes the up the flavor to NC-17 levels).

Take the shallot tart, a mess of sweet roots atop a pastry crust, with a hint of black truffle, a dab of mornay, and an almost invisible slice of lardo. The result is a shockingly delicious, solid-state French onion soup.

       "  'Before session IPAs became all the craze, there was 21st Amendment’s Bitter American. The San Francisco brewery was born in 2000, when writer Nico Freccia and paralegal-turned-brewer Shaun O’Sullivan opened a brewpub right by the Giants\\' new baseball stadium. The proximity to 81 annual home games helped the brewpub survive in the lean early years—thanks, dotcom crash!—and it’s since grown into one of the country’s 50 biggest craft breweries.  The company’s canned beer line-up (all featuring quirky, graphic-intensive artwork) includes the summery Hell or High Watermelon wheat beer; spiced Fireside Chat strong ale; roasty and lightly resinous Back in Black IPA; and until recently, Bitter American. First released in early 2007 at the brewpub, the golden \"extra pale ale\" was an easy-sipping tango of nuts and biscuits, grapefruit and pine, lemons and flowers. At 4.4 percent ABV, Bitter American was a beer that you could polish off by the six-pack.  I did. Repeatedly. Until this spring, when news came down the pipeline that 21st Amendment was killing the brand. From a marketing standpoint, I understood the move. Bitter American was never branded a session IPA. Those three letters are sales gold. Moreover, the word \"bitter\" is a bit misleading, as the beer was never all that bitter. Despite its popularity, the beer was dispatched to the dustbin, replaced by Down to Earth.  Though branded a session IPA, Down to Earth is not all that different from Bitter American. The ABV (4.4 percent) and bitterness (42 IBUs) are identical, and like its predecessor, DtE is made with plenty of Golden Promise malt, which supplies that nutty, toasty note. The huge difference is the hops. The session IPA is lavishly flavored with voguish Mosaic, a cultivar that calls to mind berries and tropical fruit. The beer drinks crisp and clean, the bitterness a moderate peck on your palate.   It’s a session IPA tuned to modern tastes, a cooler-ready crowd-pleaser that’ll keep the party going all day and night, whether you’re picnicking, at the beach or taking care of a tiny, precious human.'],\n",

Separating Bolivia from Peru at a whopping 12,507 feet above sea level, it's the highest navigable lake in the world. Feeling a bit peckish, you row your vessel over to a thatched concession stand on the side of the lake to buy a hero sandwich. What would it be like?\",\n",
       "  'The answer lies at Cumbre, one of only three Bolivian restaurants in the city. Located on Queens’ Woodside Avenue where it wends its way across the chasm of the BQE between Woodside and Elmhurst, the restaurant is intimate and boxy, with charming paintings of indigenistas and Andean villagescapes. The women in the pictures, of course, wear colorful woven shawls and those bowler hats that make them look like London gentlemen circa 1850.',\n",
       "  'The interior of Cumbre',\n",
       "  'The sandwich in question — available at Cumbre for $8 — is the tranca pecho (\"chest clogger\"). Eliciting oohs and aahs from fellow diners as it sails in on its demi-baguette, the sandwich comes diversely stuffed with a breaded beef cutlet, fried egg, chopped purple onions, ripe tomatoes, and diced beets that leave little rivulets of violent color on the stark-white egg. But the strangest ingredient of all is a layer of moist white rice that blankets the cut surface of the bread like a sort of granular mayonnaise, also ramping up the carb component — a real asset when you\\'re toiling uphill all day.',\n",
       "  'Maybe it\\'s the thin mountain air, but much of Bolivian cuisine presents similar unexpected (and often delightful) collisions of ingredients. Another case in point is pique macho ($15), a massive platter of beef swatches and hot dogs, constituting one of the world\\'s craziest culinary pairings. Also featuring onions and tomatoes, the dish looks like a stir-fry, and indeed it was probably inspired by the Chinese cuisine that appeared in Bolivia a century ago. On top of the pique macho — which means something like \"manhood challenge,\" a reference to the size of the platter — is a heap of cheese cubes. Stir them in immediately so they melt and glue the whole thing together.',\n",

       "  'Hands-down the best thing on the menu are Bolivia’s delightful empanadas, called saltenas ($2.50). The domed pies stuffed with beef or chicken also contain chopped eggs, raisins, olives, and peas. The pastry is fantastically obdurate, with a precisely braided spine. Why is the crust so hard? Tap into one and out squirts gravy. Indeed, these pies are as technically marvelous as Shanghai soup dumplings — they might be called Andean soup pies. Other dishes showing the influence of the Conquistadores include an escabeche mixto of pickled head cheese, pig foot, and vegetables that tastes good in a vinegary sort of way but requires lots of gnawing; it may not be your cup of tea.',\n",
       "  'In fact, one of the advantages of Cumbre for a certain type of adventuresome diner is the unreconstructed nature of the food, which hasn’t been gussied up to appeal to a broad spectrum of Americans. Organs, for example, abound. There’s a beef tripe soup using the type known as \"book tripe,\" which might be mistaken for white polyethylene plastic, and a kidney soup laced with cumin, for pee lovers only. Much better is an entrée of cow tongue in big tender sheets blanketed with an agreeable sauce made from fresh tomatoes. This is one of only two sauces you’ll be seeing at the restaurant, both of which have an improvised quality as if concocted on the spot and not worked over the way French sauces are.',\n",
       "  'Another use of tomato sauce is falso conejo ($7 large, $13 humongous), featuring the same breaded beef cutlet you saw in the hero sandwich. The name means \"fake rabbit,\" and the dish must have been invented just after the last bunny was shot in Bolivia, when some resourceful cook decided that a substitution smothered in sauce might go undetected. (Or you could make up your own story.)',\n",
       "  'The other improvised sauce, a bit grainy and exceedingly mild in flavor, is made with peanuts. It appears on a couple of Peruvian dishes that swam across the lake, including the beef-heart shish kebabs called anticuchos, and in the in the famous mountain concoction of boiled potatoes, papas ala Huancaina, here replacing the usual cheese sauce. Potatoes and peanuts also recur in a soup with a creamy base that floats french fries like boats on a lake. Should the fact that the fries are of the crinkle-cut frozen variety deter you from trying sopa de mani? Maybe not. This juxtaposition is only one of many startling and unpredictable features of the food at Cumbre.',\n",

Hawaii, located in the middle of nowhere in the North Pacific, is 2,500 miles from the U.S. mainland. It\\'s so far South it makes Alabama feel like a Yankee state. Its official motto is Ua Mau ke Ea o ka Aina i ka Pono, which I like to roughly translate as \"Amazon Prime shipping costs more here.\" And it\\'s an indisputable fact that there are more daily nonstop flights from JFK to China than there are to Honolulu; a Brooklynite could even fly to Moscow more quickly. The state is, by its very nature, inaccessible, which perhaps explains why only a handful of New York establishments commit themselves to Hawaiian cuisine.',\n",
       "  \"It's therefore a boon to Big Apple diners that three young restaurateurs – chef Chung Chow, Gerald San Jose, and Jin Ahn – have opened the 56-seat Noreetuh in Manhattan's East Village, a promising work-in-progress that seeks to interpret the Global East (and beyond) through a distinctly American lens. If Hawaii's melting pot cuisine has historically fused itself along the lines of its Polynesian, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, and Chinese residents, many of whom immigrated to the archipelago long before Uncle Sam annexed it at the turn of the 20th century, Noreetuh takes things even further, mixing in influences from France, New York, and elsewhere.\",\n",
       "  \"Things stay fairly traditional with the poke, a seafood salad that typically comprises raw fish, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chiles.

Take the musubi, a Hawaiian \"national\" snack that involves wrapping up sushi rice with nori and Spam, that famous luncheon meat whose consumption by World War II GI\\'s would eventually help it become a staple of Pacific cuisine. Noreetuh takes the smart step of omitting that industrial pork product and replacing it with something one might find at Katz\\'s a few blocks away: corned beef tongue. The meat is supremely flavorful by itself, but Chung tosses on a layer of chimichurri-like cilantro puree to brighten up the affair.',\n",

No cocktails at Noreetuh, just a smart list of beer, sake, wines, and something quite rare for an affordable, a la carte restaurant: beverage pairings. For $35 or more, Ahn, the general manager, will match your meal with three pours or thereabouts. Such a policy, at such a low price, should encourage more oenophilic novices to think of ordering wine as a conversation with a beverage director, rather than a random walk down an unfamiliar list.\",\n",

Chung divorces himself even further from his native Hawaii with that oceanic charcuterie. The flavor is vaguely saline, while the texture is closer to an airy ile flottante than the foie gras it aspires to be. A dollop of passionfruit gelee and slices of Portuguese-style sweet bread nominally evoke the islands, but the sensibilities of this dish are more like a French chef's dream of the Pacific. It all recalls the kind of creative elegance one might've encountered in the early aughts back at Thomas Keller's Per Se, a fine dining establishment that once employed all three of Noreetuh's principals. And here it's worth noting that while Per Se's alumni populate a wonderfully heterogeneous group restaurants throughout the city (and the world), they've been particularly active on the Asian front in NYC, giving birth to such capable institutions as Uncle Boons, Mu Ramen, and Fung Tu.\",\n",

Too bad there's little pork flavor – the meat itself, which you dip into a very run-of-the-mill barbecue sauce, is bland. The spicy gobi, a preparation that's about as incendiary and complex as a bowl of breakfast cereal, is a skip too. Kimchi-spiked octopus poke could pass for a mayonnaise-heavy seafood salad at any fine gourmet market.

Servers race between the covered patio's knobby wooden tables and the kitchen framed by sheets of corrugated aluminum siding. Meats sizzle on the asador, spitting back at the lunging flames. Down a nearby slope, an abundant garden spreads out next to a pen of goats whose bleats sound like old men bellyaching to one another. A fermentation tank, encircled with planks and bound by iron belts, flanks the restaurant. This is wine country, as the view makes plain: Rows and rows of vineyards extend into the distance, clear out to the jagged mountains carving through the horizon.\",\n",
       "  \"Just over a 90-minute drive south from San Diego, the Valle and its stark, fertile beauty have become beacons for culinary pioneers designing their own culture around the terruño (roughly the Spanish language equivalent of terroir). Nearly 100 wine producers now operate in the area, and a cottage industry of boutique hotels and some exceptional restaurants flourishes around them. This is an optimal time to visit. Creature comforts can be found, but the place doesn't yet feel commercialized or completely tamed. Beyond the main routes, many of the roads are dirt. The locals like them that way.\",\n",

       "  'Wave away the billows of dust and prepare for some sophisticated indulging. Among the many dining options, friends from the area suggested rustic Finca and the much tonier Corazón de Tierra (the two sit about seven miles apart) for examples of two gifted but very different chefs reveling in the region\\'s abundance. Finca is the Valle outpost from Javier Plascencia, Baja California\\'s cross-cultural ambassador. A native of Tijuana born into a family of restaurateurs, Plascencia runs Mision 19, opened in 2011 and heralded as the upscale trailblazer that catalyzed the city\\'s current dining renaissance. During Tijuana\\'s troubled times last decade, he ventured north with Romesco, a small plates \"Mex Med\" restaurant in Bonita, near San Diego, that\\'s still thriving. This year he\\'s launching Bracero Cocina de Raiz in San Diego\\'s Little Italy neighborhood.',\n",
       "  'Above: Grilled quail with mushrooms and pancetta; Below: Smoked clams, Octopus with Asian flavors',\n",
       "  \"Finca is to Plascencia what Husk is to Sean Brock: his place of truest expression, both personally and geographically. Most of restaurant's vegetables come from out back; meats and seafood arrive daily from local farmers and purveyors. The food matches the surroundings in its blatant, wonderful earthiness. The flavors are recognizably Mexican but stripped down. Plascencia favors cooking lamb and suckling pig slowly in a caja china, or roasting box. Each arrived as a mix of roughly chopped meat with bones for gnawing, strewn with a few strands of pickled onions and a roasted scallion. Glassy fragments of pig skin crackled against the teeth like porcine rock candy.\",\n",
       "  'Smoky dishes also seemed right with the scenery. Campfire-scented quail arrived on a platter with mushrooms and pancetta; the birds were plump and bronzed and we ate them by hand. A sea-blue pan held a shell filled with Pismo clam that had been smoked in an oak barrel and accented with fennel, Serrano chile, herb butter, and a sprinkling of queso fresco. Alongside we ordered tacos made from hot, freckled whole-wheat tortillas that we stuffed with rendered nuggets of beef cheek and dressed with chunky salsas.',\n",
       "  \"A few menu items weaved in global flavors. Grilled octopus came doused in a marinade of soy sauce, citrus, ginger, and peanuts, a nod to the influences of the Chinese and Japanese immigrants that arrived in the area nearly a century ago. Plascencia like to evoke Baja's topographical similarities to the Mediterranean with starters like beef tongue tonnato, served with the creamy tuna sauce that's a classic in Italy atop shaved veal. And note the Caesar salad among the appetizers: A few years ago Plascencia's family took ownership of the Tijuana restaurant where the leafy ubiquity purportedly originated.\",\n",
       "  \"If Plascencia is the face of emergent Valle cooking, then Diego Hernández-Baquedano, a native of Ensenada, could be considered the hands. Certainly, no Sysco truck is delivering supplies to the back door of his Corazón de Tierra. The restaurant is part of La Villa del Valle, a 70-acre property with six guest rooms and a winery. Owners Eileen and Phil Gregory, Hernández-Baquedano, and their employees maintain vegetable patches, tend beehives for honey, press oil from onsite olive trees, raise chickens for eggs (among other animals), and gather fruits from their citrus orchard. Hernández-Baquedano isn't overly dogmatic in his approach, though: He'll ship in the occasional truffles and foie gras, and he exchanges ingredients, like uncommon strains of beans and corn, with chefs in other regions of Mexico.\",\n",

(His mentors include Enrique Olvera of Pujol in Mexico City and showstopper Cosme in New York.) There isn't a menu, only a seven-course progression that changes daily and costs $68 at both lunch and dinner, with wine pairings for either $30 or $45. For the quality of the food, the skill of the preparation, and the artistry of the plating, most restaurants in America would be charging at least double that.\",\n",

After a gentle salad of impeccable lettuce leaves came a gorgeous study of fennel: the bulb cooked to silk, the root roasted to creamy crunchiness, and the fronds tickling the other elements, with a potato puree dotted with charcoal oil for a hint of smoky depth.',\n",

Crumbly bits of dehydrated masa enriched with pork fat washed the dish ashore. Corazón, too, served sublime lechón (suckling pig), this one prettily strewn with young root vegetables, and the veneer of crackling skin sculpted into a precise rectangle.\",\n",
       "  'Then, my favorite dish: a variation on tamal colado, a specialty of the Yucatan in which the masa is strained, spread over a banana leaf, and steamed until the texture resembles pudding. Yellow and red Oaxacan moles pooled around the tamale in a multihued pottery bowl; crema and black speckles of vegetable ash crowned it. The swirl of flavors and textures and colors and histories in every spoonful made the U.S. border feel very far away.',\n",
       "  'Dessert nearly dislodged my reverie. A server delivered a pure white bowl mounded with an equally colorless foam. I leaned down and sniffed: truffle oil mousse. I loathe few things more than truffle oil. Happily, there was so much going on underneath — caramel panna cotta, a \"chlorophyll sauce\" made from spinach and mint, the crunch of pistachios (plucked from the trees of Russian farmers across the way) — that the stinky whiff faded to a pheromone. Hernández-Baquedano told me later the creation was a finale he\\'d first unveiled this past New Year\\'s Eve that had been in and out of rotation since then. The dessert\\'s global bent jarred me back to reality enough that I considered asking for another order of lechón.

Seating totals around 70, twice as big as your average bistro. Which brings us back to that hamburger, a standard feature of nearly every Brooklyn bistro menu, intended to attract slightly more frugal customers intent on a bargain meal at the bar. Eschewing it on the part of The Finch is a statement in itself.\",\n",

Instead, there are separate platters of charcuterie and cheese, and ensembles of chicken-liver mousse and pork rillettes — though what you see on nearly every table is a bread course ($8) featuring warmed slices of Bien Cuit sourdough served with homemade butter and colorful radishes cut thin. Nothing feels quite so transgressive these days as knocking back gluten-intensive carbs. \"I could make a whole meal of this bread,\" said my dining companion, while thickly buttering a slice.',\n",

But sometimes these dishes are way too elaborate, with platings in which the visual aspects outweigh the flavor. One such was a serving of tiny charred purple and white cauliflower florets pent inside swooshes of colorful sauces, now gone from the menu — the assemblage evoked a trash-strewn highway interchange.

She's assisted in this endeavor by having grown up on a farm north of Florence.

Then there's Mendes, trained by the likes of Spain's Martín Berasategui and, for a two week stint, by Adria & Co. at El Bulli.

An example of the latter is khao soi ($15), a meal-size soup in a rich yellow broth stippled with red chile oil, which also shows Burmese influences. Soft egg noodles lurk in the depths while crunchy fried noodles float on top — as if the cook couldn’t decide which type to use.

Where once great Gallic behemoths like Lutece, Le Cirque, and La Cote Basque dominated the fine-dining landscape, these places were overtaken with a great whoosh by neophyte New Italian and New American establishments. A great Tuscan craze swept the restaurant industry, emphasizing fresh pastas, seafood, and vegetables in simpler, lighter preparations. Heck, these ascendant cuisines were practically sauceless, decreasing cost and prep time for restaurants increasingly plagued by cash-flow problems. But the tide was bound to turn and French food is making a comeback. With a modern twist, upstarts like Cherche Midi, Lafayette, and Dirty French have ushered in a new age of culinary opulence.',\n",
       "  'Mid-priced French bistros are beginning to bounce back, too. While we’ve retained a slender collection of old guard bistros, new ones are materializing, recalibrated to hold their own in today’s small plate and wine bar culture. One such restaurant is Le Baratin (\"The Sweet Talk\"), with a smirking fox logo that seems about to holler, \"This is an ideal place for romantic seduction.\" Le Baratin is located in Greenwich Village, once a hotbed of casual French restaurants. And the place has a pedigree: brothers Michael and Cyril Touchard, two-thirds of the ownership, grew up working with their parents in the Theatre District’s oldest bistro, Tout Va Bien. Like the proprietors of old, they personally tend the bar and patrol the dining room waiting on customers.',\n",

The bill of fare incorporates French standards, but also features a sprinkling of Italian dishes such as gnocchi and pizza. Comprising nine sections, the menu juggles all the classic hors d'oeuvres, cheese and cured-meat platters (that’s the wine-bar angle), and steaks and seafood, among such hoary bistro commonplaces as coq au vin and beef bourguignon.\",\n",

Well-marbled and tender, the thing comes smothered in a green peppercorn sauce with a bit of piquancy to it. Welcome back, sauces! The accompanying french fries are superb – scraggly, salty, and slightly greasy. Once the steak has been demolished, there’s nothing better than sopping up the last of your sauce with these unruly fries.',\n",

The salade Lyonnaise ($12) topped with a poached egg comes with way more bacon lardons than is traditional, with the dressing toned down so the vinegar doesn’t burn your lips. Call it a tamed frisee salad. The pate maison arrives in a pair of thick chunky slices, a real rustic version sided generously with toasts and a heap of salad. If this were mainly a wine-drinking evening, this could be your whole dinner. Still hungry? Many of the apps come in two portion sizes, so nibbling an order of six snails, or hogging an order of 12, or sharing it with friends, provides plenty of noshing options.',\n",

The all-French wine list is exceptional, with lots of action among the Bordeauxs and the Rhones, a good deal of it around $50 and on down. There are plenty of glasses of red, white, sparkling, and rose priced at $10 to $13, and the pour is generous.

Enormous skill is required to create colossal-scale lagers that tastes the same no matter where they’re sold, be it Alaska or Alabama. But the era of one-size-fits-all beer is ending.

The hopped-up pilsner drinks light, crisp, and daintily sweet, with a grassy finish that gently lingers like a bitter kiss.

       " [\"For the fine dining naysayers of Manhattan's gilded aughts, the pre-crash years that brought us $1,000 meals at Masa and Per Se, the 2005 debut of Danny Meyer's The Modern represented a welcome counterpoint. Located on the ground floor of MoMA in Midtown, The Modern was where one could enjoy a cocktail or a small plate for less than the twenty bucks it cost to visit the museum. Even if a longer tasting could run hundreds, there was something refreshing about an entry-level culinary experience being more accessible than an entry-level art experience – in the same building, no less. The Modern wasn't a captive audience institution designed to shake down gallery-goers with overpriced panini; it was an independent establishment, with no entry fee, designed to bring in guests who might not have visited a museum in the first place. And now, eleven years later, as the city's gastronomic and artistic centers of gravity have shifted downtown, Meyer has scored with another affordable museum eatery, this one in the Meatpacking District. Welcome to Untitled at the newly-relocated Whitney.\",\n",
       "  \"The folks to thank here are Michael Anthony, who also runs Meyer's Gramercy Tavern, and chef de cuisine Suzanne Cupps. Together, they're serving some of the city's most accomplished vegetable-forward fare at very reasonable prices. A snack for two – a glass of muscadet, a beer, a pickle plate (with stunning curried cauliflower ribs), and a lemony lobster toast – will cost less, after tax, but before tip, than two $22 tickets to the museum. Call it a boon for those who'd rather take in one of the city's newest pieces of celebrity architecture – Renzo Piano is the designer – while sitting down and eating, instead of while schlepping around the exhibits without booze.\",\n",

       "  \"Meyer, the hospitality guru behind Shake Shack, and Anthony, who once led the kitchen at Stone Barns, are doing important things here with food, wine prices, and even reservations. It's the kind of restaurant whose merits and quirks you'll be pressed to debate with your colleagues – just as you might after seeing Carroll Dunham's NSFW nude on the Whitney's fifth floor. So here are your talking points for Untitled, as well as for Meyer's more casual Studio Cafe on the 8th floor.\",\n",
       "  \"The Modern still ranks No.1 in the looks department; it's where diners relax in Arne Jacobsen chairs (which individually cost more than a MacBook Pro) while overlooking the museum's serene sculpture garden. But the Piano-designed Untitled, with its sloping ceilings and never-ending glass walls, is a close second. Guests sit in plush Eero Saarinen chairs (about $1,500 retail) while overlooking a down-the-block line of people waiting to get into the museum; it's as if Piano is saying that in the Meatpacking District, the well-heeled street denizens are the real sculptures worthy of observation. The room and the vistas, incidentally, are a heck of a lot prettier than the Whitney itself, which looks like a well-polished 1980s Xerox machine.\",\n",
       "  \"Here's a quick list of dishes that wouldn't be out of place at even an upscale museum restaurant: burgers, sandwiches, fries, or steaks. And yet Anthony doesn't serve any of the above, not even at lunch. Instead, he sends out the type of edgy, small-to-mid-sized plates that one might encounter at a boundary-pushing restaurant in Brooklyn or the Lower East Side. He gives us chamomile-infused peas with favas, a whisper of summertime sugar, or matzoh-thin flatbread anointed with bacon and creamed corn, a heavier dose of vegetable-based sweetness. He takes beets with yogurt, a fairly run-of-the-mill pairing, and turns the ingredients into an epic cold borscht of sorts; the addition of pickled cherries, sweet cherries, currants and tarragon evoke a fragrant summer evening in the Russian taiga.\",\n",

Anthony pairs creamy pole beans and soft calamari in a grilled riff on fritto misto, with an incendiary guajillo salsa for dredging and dunking. And he coats Tokyo turnips with aioli, pecorino, and guanciale, creating a hot, porky, cheesy, root vegetable carbonara.',\n",

Note to other beverage directors around the city: If you want to encourage novice oenophiles to drink more off-the-beaten track wines, this is how to do it. And here it\\'s worth mentioning that while good restaurants rarely sell more than a bottle or two of Champagne at $100 or less, Untitled, taking a cue from sister spot Marta, offers eleven in that range, including a lean, mean, 100 percent pinot meunier (Christophe Mignon) for $69.',\n",

Better are the cubes of swordfish over roasted eggplant; take away the delectably oily flesh and the dish would still boast a breathtaking degree of complexity, with a tomato saffron vinaigrette lending a floral counterpoint to the smoky nightshade. And the chicken – Anthony uses an insanely flavorful Green Circle breed – is the game-changing protein here; the breast is roasted on the rotisserie, imparting the skin with a funky, pliable softness, while the soy-and-garlic marinated thighs are fried, evoking a masterful, Japanese-style karaage.',\n",
       "  'Chamomile panna cotta with honey and berries',\n",
       "  \"Vegetable-centric restaurants don't need to push squash pudding or tomato soufflé for dessert, but like at any good culinary establishment, the sweet and savory kitchens should at least be speaking the same language, and that's not necessarily the case at Untitled. The postprandial treats of Miro Uskokovic, unlike the innovative fare of chef Anthony, can feel as generic as a pair of khakis at Georgetown University. Cake, be it the peanut butter blueberry variety or chocolate fudge, wouldn't be out of place at any airport restaurant, anywhere in America. And poundcake with strawberries is no better than the supermarket version you could make at home. Panna cotta, bland and overgelatined, is rescued by a tart berry compote, while a coconut and apricot tart packs such a dense shell it flips on its side when you try to cut it. Even the chocolate chunk cookie, while technically brilliant (and delicious), feels out of place on such an ambitious menu.\",\n",
       "  \"The Studio Cafe, a separate restaurant on the 8th floor, requires a ticket to the Whitney, and therefore qualifies as more of a traditional captive audience venue – an institution that faces little competition because this is inevitably where museum guests will come to refuel without leaving the building. And yet Anthony's mostly-toast menu (cue eye rolling) is as awesome and affordable as anything one might encounter at a cool East Village establishment. Everything's an essay in balance. Cucumbers inject a dose of watery freshness into buttery avocado toast. Green tomato jam imparts acidity to rich cheddar toast. Spicy Thai pickles cut the sweet density of honeyed peanut butter toast. And summery tomatoes, in a more traditional preparation, take the edge off the tartness of goat cheese. They're all $12 each and you enjoy them on the elevated outdoor deck, with its stunning vistas of One World Trade, the Hudson, and The Empire State Building. It's the type of food, and the type of view, that'll alone justify the museum's $85 yearly membership. And it's all enough to make us wonder whether Meyer, the new king of captive audience dining, will find a way to make us want to have dinner at the local DMV or the nearest hospital in the coming years.\",\n",

It comes with dusky collards atop a plate-size disc of injera, the spongy bread made from the tiny grain teff and, in this case, some wheat to cut its sourness.

Chef de cuisine Joseph Ward takes a mushroom mixture that's part duxelles and part mousseline and adheres it to tenderloin using meat glue, and then cooks the whole thing sous-vide. For the final assembly, he wraps the tenderloin in industrial plastic wrap before encasing it in pastry. After baking, he carefully slides off the wrap and voila — a ring of crisp pastry without a trace of sogginess. A side of mushrooms and potatoes roasted in beef fat echo the Wellington's earthy-meaty umami, and a slick of béarnaise adds old-school richness.\",\n",

They meet every week to discuss obsessions, curiosities, works in progress, and previous creations (like the Wellington) that proved popular with customers, and then they print a sheet with a dozen or so items. Each cook takes responsibility for a few dishes, which they prepare and then personally circulate through the dining room on trays and carts. Diners say yay or nay, and then the cooks hustle back to the stoves. Beyond Ethiopia and Americana, a recent dinner included the flavors of Thailand (duck leg in red curry), New England (a gorgeous lobster roll nestled in a brioche bun atop a pristine leaf of butter lettuce), Louisiana (crawfish beignets with remoulade), and an Italian-Southern amalgam (Georgia white shrimp with wilted greens in broth).

But is it? Gaston Acurio, Peru's most famous chef, belly flopped here at his high-end La Mar Cebicheria, shutting it down after less than two years. But long before Acurio, New York City possessed a decent collection of small, inexpensive Peruvian cafes aimed at immigrants and rotisserie chicken joints targeting the general population, both mainly found in Queens. Now along comes Jora, a Long Island City gastropub with a concept poised between fancy restaurant and budget café. Is Bourdain right, and can Peruvian cuisine succeed in attracting an enthusiastic citywide clientele?\",\n",

Think of the neighborhood as Greenpoint North. A friend and I stumbled on Jora after being told there was a two-hour wait at nearby Mu Ramen. We forged inside to discover a waiting area outfitted with plush couches and a pair of dining rooms sumptuously adorned with gilded Inca motifs. A line of Indian pottery lurked in niches up near the ceiling, making us feel like we were raiding a Pre-Columbian tomb. At the end of the dining rooms we found a rather luxurious bar.

Anticuchos ($9) were a pair of ruby-red veal-heart brochettes — not minuscule morsels, but hefty chunks tender enough to remind you that, like steak, the heart is a muscle. Marinated in chile paste, the symbol of bovine love had a vinegary tang with a touch of cumin and came with enough sides to be mistaken for an entrée. Scattered around the plate were bulbous kernels of hominy, a couple of red spuds, and a heap of pickled purple onions.\",\n",

Even before Jora appeared, you could see jalea being munched in taverns up and down Roosevelt Avenue.\",\n",
       "  \"The starter of octopus squirted with a curious lavender sauce, though, was dull enough to make us scream, which once again suggests the main problem of a gastropub like Jora: the owners don't trust the general public to like chili peppers as much as they do. This can be easily remedied with aji panca, a yellowish chile paste that is readily provided if you ask for it.

Strangers become acquaintances. People bring lawn chairs like they're claiming spots along a parade route. They hide from the sun under umbrellas. A staffer wanders down the row, quizzing customers on how much they're planning to order to glean an idea of when the day's meat will run out.

I arrived around 1:15 p.m. on a weekday to find no line. The brisket skewed dry, but the beef rib was sumptuous, like eating pot roast cooked over a campfire. Potato salad, a few degrees from being mashed, was flecked with onion and bell pepper, and the cole slaw's light dressing crunched with poppy seeds.

Stuckey's presence reassured that wintry night. The longtime staff, balletic pacing, and a love of the business that showed in every smile all remained very much in evidence.\",\n",

And I don’t mean the cocktails, which are stunning. I mean the bar itself. \"Every morning I come to work and I sand it down,\" chef and owner Nick Kim tells me. He forged the C-shaped counter from unfinished tamo, a type of Japanese ash used in Taylor-brand acoustic guitars. It evokes the the soft hinoki wood found at Masa, where Kim worked as head sushi chef in the mid-aughts. \"It\\'s one solid tree that we butterflied,\" Kim says. \"The surface that you\\'re touching is the middle of the tree.\" Sexy.',\n",

       "  'Inside Shuko',\n",
       "  \"Kim and his co-chef and co-owner, Jimmy Lau, have come a long way from Neta, their old 8th Street hangout where neither the brightly lit space nor the uneven food (early on, at least), matched the prices they were charging. Here, you know where your dough is going. That's good because Shuko isn’t just one of New York’s most exciting new Japanese restaurants — it’s one of the most expensive ones as well.\",\n",
       "  'The kaiseki menu runs $175, while a shorter sushi-only omakase costs $135. Either way, the first course is a stunner: two bites of homemade mochi, with pistachio miso and shiso. The taste is akin to putting a Michelin-starred piece of nut and mint-flavored Bubblicious in your mouth, a squishy, savory dessert at the beginning of the meal. Three hours later you and your date are eating a slice of apple pie, $500 poorer, and none the worse off.

Shuko's kitchen treats its ingredients with a delicate hand. The chefs amp up the natural sweetness of Dungeness crab with a hint of bonito-infused soy vinegar, while keeping the sugars in check with cucumber and chrysanthemum. Firm Chinese schrenckii caviar acts as a very expensive salt for a mound of toro tartare. And squab breast, walking that tightrope between livery and gamy, gets its natural umami essence amplified through a simple yet intense sauce reduced from the bird's bones. Getting full? Well here comes the sushi. So if you've got the scratch for a second visit, do the cheaper menu to save more stomach space for raw fish over rice.\",\n",

Hard alcohol isn't the best beverage pairing to bring out the subtleties of sushi, but forgoing Shuko’s mixed drinks ($16) would mean overlooking one of the city’s better restaurant cocktail programs.

So before a slice of giant clam over rice, he’ll serve it plain first, to let you appreciate the mollusk’s intoxicating cucumber crunch. He’ll give you a spoonful of uni from \"in between Santa Barbara and Monterey Bay,\" so you can better discern its concentrated kinship with Maine urchin. Got it? Now you\\'re ready for the orange roe over rice.',\n",
       "  'This is all somewhat atypical, as a sushi course often consists of sushi and nothing else. Shuko trades in gentle aberrations. If the palate starts to feel overwhelmed after a slice of creamy sawawa or fatty ocean trout, Lau might toss over a slice of vinegared cucumber, or a knob of daikon. It makes you want to eat more. And like at Masa, the final piece before dessert is pickled lotus root wrapped around shiso; it awakens your senses before the sweets appear.',\n",

Enjoy that bite, because there’s not a lot of it here. Instead of the tuna-paloozas that are common elsewhere (Ichimura is famous for stacking up to three slices on a single piece of rice), Shuko often only serves about two pieces of the meaty delicacy as part of the $135 menu, or three if you count the excellent sinew, which Kim grills over the binchotan and places in a hammock of nori.

As more traditional sushi (and fine dining chefs) needlessly keep the Scoville meter in check, Shuko likes to lay it on hot.',\n",
       "  \"On my visits, Nick and Lau didn't quite keep their rice consistently firm. The grains here don’t always roll around on the tongue as they should, like balls of good caviar, separate and distinct. Sometimes they mush too easily. Sometimes they lack enough vinegar.

It often flows over the sides of the shells and then quickly darkens under the broiler. The color underneath remains a few shades brighter than the ink used to dye a wad of Benjamins. Anise shoots through the puree, underpinned by fennel and a shot of Herbsaint liqueur. The greens (at least spinach and parsley; perhaps watercress lurks as well) taste sharper than one would expect.

An order of soufflé potatoes, like puffy fries, arrived tepid; our server whisked them away with a nod and soon returned with a fresher batch. The flesh of fried trout prepared amandine style crackled against the teeth; a scattering of slivered almonds echoed the crunch. Brown butter and crabmeat heightened the sweetness of pompano, the restaurant's default fish special. I've been eating at Galatoire's since the 1990s but never had a meal impressed me more: There was a finer tuning to the preparations than in years past.

Apple and sage spoonbread was the stuffing for copper-skinned quail on a cushion of farro, butternut squash, and torn shards of mustard greens.

Call it an unusually delicious menage a trois of fat. Such preparations can border on feeling like a Dean & Deluca raid, but it's all so awesome that Hamilton somehow manages to pull them off.

How big is the steak? It's so big our waiter pushes two tables together to serve it. What does it come with? A side of dry-aged beef fat and mushroom carpaccio. How intense is the lardo? It's so rich that we cleanse our palates not with wine but with butter-laden pommes puree, which is like drinking a double espresso to come down from an eight ball and a can of Four Loko. Now you know.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'Interior of Dirty French. All photos by Daniel Krieger',\n",
       "  'How does it all taste? Bite into the beef and a peppery crust gives way to a crimson, silky interior. The Niman Ranch cow is aged for 60 days, imparting a level of tenderness that allows the steak to be served rare; try that temperature with a lesser cut and it would be all sinew and chew. The flavor is clean and sweet, the tell-tale sign of a proper grass-feeding. Want more tang? Take that funghi and fat carpaccio and drape it over the beef; the funk is so intense I ask if the chefs slipped a little blue cheese in there. They did not.',\n",
       "  \"How much does it cost? The smallest cut was $167, which works out to over $200 after tax and tip. It is one of the city's spendiest steaks, not surprising because Dirty French, located in the Lower East Side's Ludlow Hotel, is brought to us by the team behind Torrisi and Carbone, two of the city's best and most expensive Italian-American restaurants.\",\n",
       "  'Dirty French calls itself a \"bistro,\" which is about as accurate as calling Sofia Coppola\\'s rock-and-roll narrated Marie Antoinette a true account of the 18th century matriarch. It is rather a globally-minded Gallic chophouse and seafood emporium, with nods to India, Southeast Asia, North Africa, and thanks to Cajun-spiced porgy, Creole Country. If Keith McNally\\'s lovely Cherche Midi is a hat tip to the old ways of fancypants French dining, with its cheese soufflées, frog legs, and île flottantes, Dirty is a look toward the diverse and diaspora-fueled future of high-end French fare. It is also one of the fall\\'s finest openings.',\n",
       "  \"Torrisi roasts Island Creek oysters over coals and tops them with parsley butter for an easy umami high. Lamb carpaccio, dotted with figs, sheep's yogurt, and mint, boasts the gossamer texture of tissue paper but still packs a mighty musk. Humble baked clams, sweetened with almonds and spiked with a smattering of Berbere spices, sport a lingering brine more characteristic of the regal sea urchin.\",\n",
       "  \"Lamb carpaccio with mint, charred eggplant, figs, sheep's yogurt\",\n",
       "  \"And then there is the mille-feuille. It contains no phyllo. Chef Rich Torrisi slices royal trumpet mushrooms on a mandoline, presses the leaves of funghi into a mold, roasts them, and finishes the vegetarian terrine with bright green curry. It's as delicate and buttery as baklava — until the coconut and coriander of the verdant sauce kick everything into overdrive. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, one of the original gangsters of global French fusion, should be jealous as it's the type of dish that wouldn't be out of place at his three-Michelin-starred flagship.\",\n",
       "  \"It's also the type of $17 snack you'd like to eat every day — something you could at a proper bistro, which this is not. Dirty French is still largely for those who reserve in advance. Partner Jeff Zalaznick tells me he'll be able to accommodate more walk-ins when things settle down and that he'll debut a full menu at the bar in 2015. For now, the good news is you won't be alone when you take that 11 pm reservation. Close to midnight on Thursday, there's a Ferrari parked in front and Dirty French is packed with well-dressed folks drinking $16 cocktails or good Champagne (there are five bottles under $100). That means that unless everyone here is unemployed — unlikely given the prices — a select group of New Yorkers is going to wake up for work six hours later hungover and smelling like old lamb.\",\n",
       "  \"Those are good problems to have. Dirty French, after all, could stand on its own as a high-end cocktail bar thanks to Thomas Waugh, who's put together a list of original potables that match the global spirit of Torrisi's cooking while still tasting good. He softens the blow of Irish whiskey with creme de banane; he amps up the spice of bourbon with ancho chile and cinnamon; he tames the power of tequila with the tang of yogurt and lime.\",\n",
       "  'That last creation is what you drink with the lamb saddle, essentially the same \"mutton chop\" you get at Keens except this one is cheaper ($38 vs. $51) and more expertly seasoned.

What makes the soup grand is its use of octopus to mimic the gelatinous eel in the traditional Marseille preparation, as well as the addition of nutty rouget to evoke the heady flavors of the Mediterranean.',\n",
       "  \"Feeling bloody? Torrisi\\xa0transforms duck a l'orange, after a few turns on the rotisserie, into a study in silky fat, irony-meat and crispy skin. But even better is the $72 chicken for two, which deserves credit for making the $200 steak seem cheap by comparison. Torrisi roasts the breast and finishes it in mustard sauce and foie gras fat. He then marinates the thighs in fish sauce, kaffir, and lemongrass before slowly confiting them into fall apart bliss. Wicked stuff. Dab some house-made harissa onto the meat, wrap it all up in flour pancakes, and there's your Peking Chicken, an excellent ode to nearby Chinatown.\",\n",

       " [\"\\n  Our first restaurants from Uzbekistan appeared in the 90s in Hell's Kitchen and the Diamond District, dispensing charcoal-grilled kebabs to a mixed constituency of Orthodox Jewish gem traders and barbecue-obsessed destination diners. At Gan Eden on 47th Street, the luscious, grease-glistening brochettes were cooked next to an open window over a baking sheet filled with lump charcoal — making patrons fear asphyxiation. They came in droves anyway. Subsequent larger restaurants appeared in Rego Park, Queens, and Borough Park, Brooklyn, offering full menus from the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Tashkent, where Silk Road influences informed a cuisine of noodle-bearing soups, meaty rice pilafs, circular breads indented in the middle, purse-shaped dumplings, and those charcoal-grilled kebabs we first fell in love with.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'But many of the two dozen or so newer establishments catered mainly to interminable Russian banquets, where the vodka flowed more freely than the food, and tables of only three or four intent on having a normal-length meal and ordering from the menu were made to feel like unwanted orphans. But now a new place called Uzbechka has appeared on Avenue O in an obscure corner of Bensonhurst, much friendlier to outsiders and small parties alike. The immigrant family that runs the place — two brothers, one sister, a mother, and an uncle — settled in Kansas City and Key West before moving to Brooklyn and have thereby acquired a certain savvy where American restaurants are concerned. And the younger members speak perfect idiomatic English, just in case your Russian or Farsi is rusty.',\n",
       "  'Uzbechka\\'s menu has its specific origins in Tashkent, a city of two million in the eastern region of the country that was razed by Genghis Khan in the 13th century. The interior of the large dining room offers two rows of tables under swooshes of colorful fabric that make the interior feel like a caravanserai; the walls are plastered with photos of craftspeople, cooks, and monuments in fanciful frames. (\"My uncle made those frames,\" our waitress proudly announced.) An impromptu stage framed in Persian carpets is found at the far end of the room, where a door leads to a tented backyard seating area that will be quite an asset when warmer weather returns.',\n",
       "  'Lagman soup and Uzbechka salad',\n",
       "  'The Tashkent take on the national dish of plov incorporates carrots, chick peas, yellow raisins, and fatty chunks of lamb into a wonderfully oily rice pilaf. The $8 serving will easily give four diners a good taste. If you were back in Tashkent, the dish might also include horsemeat sausage. Another city themed dish is called Tashkent salad, which makes surprising use of shredded daikon and a green radish native to China, along with lamb, sauteed onions, and boiled eggs, \"with a little bit of mayo,\" as the menu charmingly puts it.',\n",
       "  \"While the bill of fare offers a bumper crop of salads, most deploy meat and much larger quantities of mayo and thus may not conform with your ideas about salads. An exception is achichuk ($6.50), which is mainly ripe tomatoes and slightly pickled onions in a light vinaigrette, wearing a lovely carved crown of cucumber like a medieval potentate. Named after the restaurant, Ubechka salad ($9) finds the family (they take turns cooking) freestyling with a bewildering array of Western ingredients, ranging from kielbasa and beef to cheddar cheese and corn, with crunchy potato straws on top. Reflecting their time spent in America, there's a Caesar salad, too.\",\n",
       "  'Manti; Kebabs',\n",
       "  'You could begin with composed salads and then go right to the kebabs, or you could commence instead with apps like manti (beautiful lamb dumplings served with dilled yogurt) or samsa (flaky and deeply brown meat pastries dotted with sesame seeds). Alternatively, you could start with soups ($6.99 each): the most famous is lagman, based on a rich beef-and-vegetable broth and swarming with long, irregular, handmade noodles — by legend the ones Marco Polo discovered and brought back to Italy. If you believe that, I have an ornate Silk Road mosque to sell you.',\n",
       "  'The lagman served at Uzbechka is indeed one of the best in town, but even better is okroshka, a cold yogurt soup whose pale white surface bobs with potatoes and radishes, while fresh herbs float on its surface and a beef julienne lurks in its depths. The soup is supremely tart and tasty and resembles something you might find in a health-food restaurant. Unfortunately, as colder months arrive, okroshka disappears from the menu.',\n",
       "  'On to the kebabs! As a barbecue lover, they might be your entire motive for visiting Uzbechka. Heavily laced with onions and lamb fat, the ground-meat lyulya kebab is the smokiest, reeking of animal funk. Referred to as \"chicken soft\" — meaning it has benefited from a yogurt marinade in the Persian fashion — the chicken skewers are tender and flavorful. While lamb-chunk kebabs are often tough in Central Asian places, here they\\'re not. As for the liver: liver is liver, and charcoal does little to improve it. Other choices include not-bad beef kebabs, luxury lamb chops, and exceedingly fatty lamb ribs. If you\\'re ordering kebabs for a table of three or four, why not get all seven ($26)? Which is a steal for such a large heap of meat. And don\\'t forget the dill-dusted french fries ($3.25). Though they didn\\'t originate in Uzbekistan, the fries are the kebabs\\' natural companion on any continent.'],\n",

Dependable Cuban sandwich cafes thrive, and there are the homegrown successes like Michael's Genuine Food & Drink in the Design District and Miami Beach's Pubbelly that have spawned flourishing restaurant groups. But the city also rivals Las Vegas in its appetite for glittery concepts imported by national and international celebrity chefs. The lure of their bespangled dining rooms, housed mostly in hotels and resorts along the water, proves powerful. Over the years, though, I've found too many of them inconsistent, particularly beyond the first months in business when the parent company turns its attention to the next project. Even spinoffs from local talent can be uneven: A recent lunch at Seagrape — a new restaurant in the freshly renovated Thompson Hotel helmed by Michelle Bernstein, a chef whose food I usually admire — proved a letdown with fishy grilled snapper and lackluster salads.\",\n",

Color detonates from every corner of the restaurant; murals by Haitian artists cover the walls and the tables. Tourists as well as local Haitian expats fill the labyrinth of dining rooms, sipping rum cocktails laced with passion fruit or lime and sharing dishes like fried chunks of goat with a vinegary dipping sauce; grilled conch, chewy but satisfying; and shrimp in coconut sauce. I hadn't been to Tap Tap in a decade. This time I was particularly taken with a plate of spaghetti tossed with tomato, onion, and potent, anchovy-like bits of herring.

       "  'Preparations showed cheffy finesse: Bolitas de queso, a typical snack of fried cheese spheres, combined mild queso paisa with Monterey Jack and cheddar for smart ratios of gush and tang. Drizzles of guava sauce provided tropical-sweet complexity. Arañitas de platano (shredded green plantain fritters) were fun but probably redundant when ordering mofongo, the traditional dish of fried and mashed plantains in which Carey takes pride.

When I inquired after the city's model Cuban sandwich, several locals pointed me to Enriqueta's, a breakfast and lunch staple in Wynwood long before the community began its ascent into gentrification. It was the Cubano of the mind's eye and palate, the shiny, oblong bread griddled to crispness and the pressed stack of thinly sliced meats exclamatory with mustard and pickles. It held up well against a powerhouse new Little Havana contender, Little Bread Cuban Sandwich Co., launched in November by Alberto Cabrera. He also operates Bread + Butter in Coral Gables, where he serves pork-filled empanadas, grits with oxtail meat, and other dishes inspired by his Cuban-American heritage.\",\n",

His cooks stack black forest ham, salami, pork belly rillettes, and Swiss cheese; heat them on a baking sheet in a massive red smoker for a few minutes; and then transfer them to a squishy toasted roll slathered with mustard aioli and pickled mustard seeds. The bread didn't have the archetypal crunch, but in every other way it was a superior sandwich. A fun appetizer of croquetas suffused with the flavors of a media noche, the Cubano variation made with sweet bread, reinforced how masterfully Cabrera owns this iconic mix of flavors and textures.\",\n",

Rich in woods and touches of turquoise, the place clicked as a group destination: We passed platters of causas (potatoes whipped with aji chile and topped with whimsies such as beet, crab, avocado, and fried kale) and marveled over a version of fideos fashioned using squid ink pappardelle. And a second outpost of downtown Miami restaurant Ceviche 105 on Lincoln Road successfully remade itself in a South Beach image, all sleek lines and sexy shadows and outbursts of tropical hues.

I’m guessing, though, that he might quickly drop some aspects to his 15-course tasting menu that recall the sillier facets of U.S. molecular gastronomy madness from a decade ago. For example, after a starting round of empanadas and ropa vieja splattered with peanut sauce, my friend and I soon had metal bowls in front of us. A staffer then carried over a carafe of rose-scented, Pepto-bismol pink goo and poured it over our hands.

       " [\"\\n  The homemade soba delivered toward the end of an omakase meal at Tei-An was served on a traditional woven bamboo mat. But the noodles also came with an avant-garde accessory: a whopping block of ice. It loomed large atop the nest of chilled soba, catching the light like an obscene diamond or some sacred object carried by the White Walkers on Game of Thrones. The frozen bling was meant to give the soba a stroke of sex appeal. We're living in the age of ramen, the extrovert among Japanese noodles with its steamy pork-bone broth and its garnishes of just-set egg, whiskery scallions, and glossy meats. Soba, best eaten simply to appreciate its subtleties, can by comparison seem meditative, perhaps even dull.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'Chilled soba noodles with ice block',\n",
       "  'There was nothing banal, though, about the taupe strands that Teiichi \"Teach\" Sakurai, Tei-An\\'s chef-owner, crafts daily. They had life force. As with the differences in fresh and dried Italian pastas, Sakurai\\'s handiwork sidestepped the brittle or waterlogged textures that often plague packaged soba. These briefly resisted against the teeth before yielding their flavor, faint but pleasing with buckwheat\\'s distinct, roasty earthiness. A turquoise ceramic cup alongside held a dipping sauce of dashi and keishi (soy sauce, mirin, and sugar) simmered with duck meat and skin. I dunked and swished tangles of noodles, slurped, and repeated. When the last noodle disappeared, a server rushed over to pour hot soba cooking water into the cup to create a few sips of liquid umami.',\n",
       "  \"If Dallas doesn't rank as one of the country's great bastions of Asian cuisines, North Texas food lovers nonetheless know that they have something special in Sakurai. I lived in Dallas when he opened Tei-An in 2008; I consider him one of the country's outstanding and\\xa0— outside the city — largely unsung Japanese chefs. A native of Tokyo, Sakurai brought Dallas its first true-minded sushi bar with Teppo in 1995, and soon after introduced Japanese-style grilling (not the Americanized clowning where cooks juggle knives) at Tei Tei Robata Bar.\",\n",
       "  \"Some Japanese chefs famously devote their career to perfecting one dish or genre. Sakurai's driving curiosity spurred him last decade to sell both businesses to employees and devote himself to soba, a famously querulous dough (with its ratio of eighty-percent buckwheat and twenty-percent wheat) to form and cut. In preparation for launching Tei An, one of the anchors in the One Arts District complex near downtown, Sakurai returned briefly to his hometown to study at the Tsukiji Soba Academy. In keeping with the ritual around eating soba, he designed a sanctuary of a restaurant: calm lines, grainy woods, and a rock garden with a trickling fountain in the center of the prominent soba bar. (A window behind the bar looks into the room where Sakurai makes the noodles.) A separate bar area in the front caters to a rowdier crowd.\",\n",
       "  'Above: Sanma mackerel; Left: Crab and uni risotto; Right: Caviar nigiri',\n",
       "  'Not that one shouldn\\'t be imbibing. Sakurai gave an instructive quote when I wrote about Tei An for the Dallas Morning News: \"When I was young, my grandfather told me over and over, ‘Teiichi, never drink sake at a sushi bar. Sake is for drinking at soba houses. Drink sake and enjoy appetizers first, and then, at the very end of the meal, enjoy the soba.\\'\" Heed grandpa\\'s words. There are sakes here that meet every budget and taste, and the staff, many of whom have been with Sakurai since the restaurant opened, are skilled guides.',\n",
       "  \"In the six years since Tei An launched, its menu has grown three-fold to accommodate diverse tastes. Look for the purest expressions of Japanese cooking, like a salad of fluttery white seaweed, cucumbers, and carrots dressed in white vinegar, or cubes of silky-crisp tofu coated in buckwheat flour and deep-fried. Specials might include smoked salmon collar or a buckwheat version of okonomiyaki, a pancake filled with vegetables and seafood. The specials also wade into Sakurai's cross-cultural whimsies, like caviar nigiri or crab and uni risotto served in the crab's hollow shell. Though I prefer the more strictly Japanese dishes, these adjuncts are undeniably delicious.\",\n",
       "  \"I'm definitely less inclined toward the soba variations sauced in riffs on carbonara or Bolognese. Sakurai views them as gateway pleasures for the uninitiated. My hope is that diners will come to appreciate the soba in its sublime purity, paired with dipping sauces like black sesame or matched with greaseless tempura for stouter appetites.\",\n",
       "  \"To best understand Sakurai's mastery, call ahead to request the seven-course, $100 omakase, built around a gamut of techniques. My recent meal began with sashimi and then custardy, saffron-hued egg, steamed with dashi, returned to its shell, and topped with one sliver of musky black truffle. Next, two exquisite seasonal treats: tempura of woodsy matsutake mushrooms, which grow wild around white or red pines in Japan. They sat in a crackly cluster alongside a small bowl of gohan, rice flavored with the matsutakes. Now something grilled: sanma mackerel. Sakurai appeared from the kitchen to tell us how these fish swim down from northern Japan in the fall and are caught off the waters of the central Chiba prefecture. If the fish swim too far south, Sakurai said, they lose too much fat and aren't as luscious.\",\n",
       "  'Soba and tempura',\n",
       "  'Before the ice sculpture soba finale, there was one more delicacy: A5 wagyu beef, from the Miyazaki prefecture along the southeastern coast of Kyushu island, so marbled in even patterns of pink meat and white fat that it looked more like a dress print than dinner. A staffer seared a few slices for each for us on a hot stone. After the soba there was a gentle denouement with dorayaki, a spongy pancake filled with sweetened red bean paste. I felt deeply and precisely sated.',\n",
       "  \"Now that I've enumerated Tei-An's singular qualities, it's probably time to mention that the place also serves what many regard as the finest bowl of tonkotsu ramen in Dallas — the broth textbook milky, the chashu pork sweet, saline, and limpid. Also: Sakurai is opening a ramen bar called Ten in early 2015. It'll be a smash, no doubt. But when the ramen carousers need repose, the temple of soba will be waiting.\",\n",

That’s all the more true as Meyer gets ready to shutter his beloved Union Square Cafe, a move that will make Gramercy, founded in 1994, his oldest restaurant. This reliable (and perennially-packed) mainstay is, without question, New York’s quintessential American restaurant, a status affirmed over the course of two recent visits by Eater critics Ryan Sutton and Robert Sietsema. Below, they both provide their takes.\",\n",
       "  'In an age when big ticket restaurants open nearly every day, when expensive and wildly creative tasting menus are a given, and when a cornucopia of small but colorful ingredients often explode across the city\\'s small plates, we tend to forget how revolutionary Gramercy Tavern was when it was debuted in 1994 by Danny Meyer and Tom Colicchio. Ruth Reichl gave the place two stars in 1994, noting somewhat shaky service and a few menu missteps, but also declaring, \"Gramercy Tavern is a grand attempt to reinvent the American luxury restaurant.\" By 1996, she\\'d upped her rating to three stars, offering unstinting praise for Colicchio\\'s cooking.',\n",
       "  'It seemed like an entirely new sort of restaurant.',\n",
       "  \"My East Village pals and I were well aware of Gramercy Tavern, too. It seemed like an entirely new sort of restaurant. While we'd never dared set foot in a luxury French establishment, Gramercy Tavern seemed strangely accessible, and the lure was the cheaper bar menu in the front room. I remember going several times in the mid-90s, happily downing a leg-of-lamb sandwich and a beer. The meat was richly textured, smoky like barbecue, and almost gamy. Most important, a satisfying meal could be had for $20 or so, a splurge my friends and I could afford.\",\n",
       "  \"Some tip their hats to Larry Forgione’s 1980s-era relic, American Place, in helping to break the French stranglehold on East Coast fine dining. But let's be real. Gramercy Tavern is the one that’s still alive and thriving. The 20th Street space has been sending out vegetable-focused tasting menus in the formal dining room long before it was the cool thing to do, and the more casual Tavern Room has been whipping up ambitious and affordable fare to a no-reservations crowd years before Momofuku Ssam Bar or Roberta’s championed that stripped-down style of dining.\",\n",
       "  'Gramercy, like any decades-old establishment, went through at least one rough patch, when Michael Anthony took over the kitchen reins in 2006. Alan Richman of Bloomberg News (where I worked at the time) responded to his young tenure with a fast and furious takedown. But things improved soon after, and now, eight years later, Anthony is putting out clean American fare that’s occasionally as breathtaking as anything at Dan Barber’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns.',\n",
       "  \"Above: Gramercy Tavern's formal dining room; Below: Turnips and Celery root chowder\",\n",
       "  'The formal dining room is where half of the magic happens. So many chefs send out raw scallops with citrus, most of which are too cold, too bland, too acidic, or too sweet. Here, they could pass muster at Masa. Anthony’s Peconic bay mollusks pack that delicate balance of sugar and brine, with such a modicum of yuzu you wonder whether the fragrant Japanese fruit is simply a figment of your imagination.',\n",
       "  'That fine shellfish course, incidentally, kicks off a seven-course affair that could easily cost $150 at a lesser restaurant. Gramercy asks just $120 for its vegetable-heavy chef’s tasting, an exceedingly reasonable price tag. And for a few dollars less, Anthony also sells a $102 menu of equal length with even more vegetables (and no meat), as well as a $92 three-course menu (for those who get stressed out by small plates).',\n",
       "  '\"The menu is all about celebrating modest ingredients,\" Anthony tells me, which is why we have dashi-braised turnips with turnip foam — edible rubies on a plate. He stuffs beets inside ravioli for a crimson punch of sugar and forges his finishing sauce not from a pound of cream but from a lighter parsnip puree. And he transforms lobster from a dominant protein into a equal dance partner for seasonal vegetables.',\n",
       "  'The tasting showed off clean, clear, accessible flavors.',\n",
       "  'The tasting was quick by modern standards — about two and a half hours — and showed off clean, clear, accessible flavors. Sous-vide squash did its best impression of a ham steak, with the vegetable’s heft emphasized over its delicate sweetness. Anthony turned seafood chowder into study of surf and earth: flavors of ocean and brine (trout roe, halibut, mussels), contrasted against rich celery root soup (which, alas, didn’t exhibit any of the clam stock it was supposedly made with). And for a clever curveball, the kitchen slipped petals of brussels sprouts underneath three slices of duck breast, gently perfuming the gamy protein with their verdant musk.',\n",

The soup arrived dry but was dramatically finished with an arc of creamy broth poured from a teapot, one of several tableside flourishes. A close second was the rare but crisp-skinned duck breast, three miniature slices that rolled in rather comically on an undercarriage of four small brussels sprouts.

It was an outpost of the empire of Indian dining impresario and B-list Bollywood actor Shiva Natarajan, whose other holdings in the city include Chola, Dhaba, Malai Marke, and Chote Nawab — oddly named after a 1961 movie nobody seems to like. But Natarajan has done more to popularize the regional cuisines of his native land than anyone before him, and has also been instrumental in remaking the restaurant scene on lower Lexington Avenue, nicknamed \"Curry Hill\" since the 1980s. The food at his establishments — at slightly elevated prices — is frequently excellent.',\n",
       "  'Which is why I was disappointed when Bhojan shuttered just as it was gaining traction, and Natarajan replaced it with Haldi, specializing in the food of Calcutta and Bengal. Sprinkled throughout the menu are a small collection of Jewish-Indian delicacies, real critic bait. I was there in a flash. The Indian-Jewish stuff proved OK, though lacking in nuance, but when I brought a Bengali friend to sample the food he\\'d grown up with, he wrinkled up his nose and exclaimed, \"The curries are well-prepared and wholesome, but the place has got the spicing scheme all wrong!\" And I had to agree: the food tasted way more Punjabi than Bengali, with a dearth of mustard oil and too many entrees awash in brown gravy.',\n",

Instead, I took a chance and dragged myself and my friends to another Natarajan restaurant a few doors down, Kokum. We found an interior decorated with hanging basket lamps and a mural of the high-prowed and brightly painted fishing boats of Kerala, India's southernmost state. The dining room was deep and narrow, with rows of tables along both walls. A bar at the end of the room dispensed beer, wine, and cocktails.

Another dish featuring the same red fruit is Nadan fish curry ($18), name-checking a 2013 film set in Kerala featuring an old-fashioned dramatic troupe on the skids.

Eggs occur in stealthier fashion in egg dosa, a crepe featuring the usual potato filling. But when you cut into it you'll find an egg annealed to the inside of the pancake. In likewise fashion, eggs appear as the star of the show in a biryani; scrambled with tomatoes, chiles, and torn-up flatbread in egg kothu paratha (like some mutant bread pudding); and most spectacularly in egg appam, bowl-shaped breads, each with a runny fried egg at the bottom, sided with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry.\",\n",

A wry take on American predilections paired deboned chicken wings painted with subtle teriyaki sauce atop a gratin of long macaroni noodles. Lobster salad with sherry vinaigrette bundled in a nest of butter lettuce was as appealing in taste as in beauty. Two Robuchon classics that often rotate through the tasting menu showcased his mastery of decadence tempered with sophistication. Morsels of foie gras-stuffed quail shaped like sausage links came with a side of the chef’s famous potato puree — the one that incorporates a pound of butter for every two pounds of spuds.

Both gratified, but the rib-eye brought deeper, more rewarding notes of mineral and blue cheese. (My palate leans to dry-aged steaks, though.)

I liked it so much I asked for a second \"main course\" dessert: The Carib, a whirligig of ingredients in a bulbous wine glass that included coconut panna cotta, caramelized banana, diced mango and kiwi, cantaloupe sorbet, and a stick of cinnamon pastry for crunch. A white chocolate wafer was placed atop the glass and then melted like one of Salvador Dalí\\'s clocks when hot mango sauce was poured over it.

In a dish called sen mee kang pou, lumps of crabmeat lulled in perfumed coconut milk, with knots of vermicelli rice noodles to help capture the sauce. It wasn’t all gentle: A pungent fermented fish curry with bamboo shoots, Thai eggplants, and other vegetables jangled my sinuses.

Mark Marhefka — a second-generation fisherman who runs a small business called Abundant Seafood — catches the iridescent blue fish and delivers them to Charleston chefs clamoring for a local catch. None likely render the mackerel\\'s oily richness more delectably than Mike Lata, one of Marhefka\\'s steadiest customers. At FIG (\"Food Is Good\"), the restaurant Lata opened in 2003, he recently smoked the fish and arranged generous slices around Napa cabbage cooked down to lushness and mixed with chopped egg. In the center he piled trout roe and the dish\\'s one overt wink to the region: whipped buttermilk. The flavors more reflected the province of New York delis (via Eastern European cooking traditions) than Southern kitchens. It didn\\'t matter. The combination seduced the palate the same way the harmonics of a Beach Boys tune hook the ears.\\n  ',\n",
       "  \"FIG was among a new generation of Charleston restaurants that led the city to modern culinary acclaim, and a decade later the attention is nowhere close to letting up. It helps, of course, that the 350-year-old city is one of the most visited places in America. Around 5 million travelers amble along Charleston's cobblestoned streets annually, and plenty of them come expressly to eat. It keeps the dining scene electric and competitive. And yet, similar to New Orleans, the best of the established restaurants in Charleston continue to improve. Though I'm always curious about the latest openings, this is a place where, more than most, I find myself compelled to return to a handful of stalwarts each visit.\",\n",

One week Lata and executive chef Jason Stanhope will showcase lean, mustard-crusted amberjack glossed with brown butter and capers, or cook grouper, mild in flavor and texture, in sherry sauce with spaghetti squash; the next will feature roasted black bass accented simply with breadcrumbs, garlic, and oregano.\",\n",

It was the kind of bold plate I've often enjoyed perched at the long bar, sipping a sparkling rosé or a cocktail that headlines rum, a longtime favorite of Charlestonians. The place instantly feels like an entrenched part of the dining landscape, housed in 1920s-era bank transformed into a grand dining hall with 22-foot ceilings.

If you show up at Hominy at 12:30 p.m. on a Sunday, the restaurant can at first feel like a tourist trap: Dozens of people may be waiting for a table, and the take-out window for beverages near the entrance can run out of coffee.

Stehling's honors lineage as much as geography: His version hews closely to the one perfected by his mentor, the late Bill Neal of Crooks Corner in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Friends sent me far up King Street to Leon's Oyster Shop, an airy hangout in a former auto garage co-owned by Brooks Reitz, who managed FIG and then The Ordinary. Reitz's chef, Ari Kolender, bridges the flavor spectrum between regional and global. Every table has at least one order of char-grilled oysters, piled on a plate with batons of toast for sopping up the puddles of butter and parmesan that remain in the shells. A list of easygoing small plates includes avocado toast, fried Brussels sprouts, and Siam salad, a whirl of Napa cabbage, avocado, orange segments, herbs, and fried shallots. It's the oysters and the fried chicken I'll return for, though. In a city (and world) agog with fried chicken, Kolender nevertheless serves impeccable fowl: The bird stays succulent under a bronze veneer of breading that almost shatters like caramelized sugar.\",\n",

Made with fragrant, locally grown Carolina Gold rice and topped with crabmeat and scallions, the porridge recalls Asian congee: It soothes the nervous system and rouses hunger. And thirst — which Edmund's is more than equipped to quench. Owners Scott Shor and Rich Carley opened South Carolina's first craft beer shop in 2007. Cocktails like the Tchoupitoulas Sling (cognac, Rittenhouse Rye, absinthe, Benedictine, Peychaud's bitters) show mastery of balance, but beer, including several house-made brews, is the official house drink.

A generous filet of black sea bass arrives speckled with brown butter, alongside farro and cabbage cooked risotto style, and softened with a nage of milk and Meyer lemon.

       "  \"One such dish is Lao chicken soup ($10), a sizable tureen that deposits the unusual combo of fresh chicken and pickled fish in a tart brown tamarind broth. Dredge around and find shredded green papaya, tangling tendrils of water spinach, firm long-beans, and Thai eggplants, which look for all the world like tiny watermelons. A perfumed odor wafts up from the bowl as the soup is served. Isaan strikes back with a seafood soup ($15) also based on tamarind broth, flavored with fish sauce, basil, lemongrass, and jaew — a fiery ground-spice mixture that explodes with umami. Jaew is just one of the surprises that lurks around every corner of Lan Larb's menu.\",\n",
       "  'The heart of the bill of fare are the ground-meat salads called larbs (alternatively known as laaps, larps, or lahbs, according to a footnote on the menu). While most Thais in town offer pedestrian chicken and pork versions, here there are eight, of which the best is made with duck ($11). It incorporates little tidbits of skin among micro-nuggets of the feathered creature, conferring a welcome crispness. Back in Isan, the salad would be dressed with duck blood, which may be a little more funk than Soho could stand.',\n",
       "  'Above: Pad kee mao and Larb pla krapong; Below: Sai krog isan',\n",
       "  \"The catfish version is also worth ordering, utilizing a sun-dried form of the fish broken up into chewy shreds redolent of a muddy and lazy river. Another version, and one not offered at Larb Ubol, is larb nam-tok nuer, featuring beef that's been grilled in strips rather than merely ground and steamed, and hence retains more meaty savor. Any larb comes accompanied by cabbage and cucumbers; one way to eat these larbs is by piling bitefuls on the veggies. Sumpatboon offers competing renditions of som tum, too, the famous shredded green papaya salad prepared with a mortar and pestle, which more effectively releases the aromatic flavors than, say, a food processor. The Laotian version of the papaya salad adds raw crab and pickled fish, while the Isaan one deploys dried shrimp.\",\n",
       "  'It will be like a flamethrower in your mouth',\n",
       "  'While Larb Ubol pointedly ignores curries entirely, Lan Larb offers them out of necessity, given the broad range of expectations for Thai food on the part of its patrons. While the green curry is predictably humdrum, the massaman curry of beef and potatoes is a paragon of unspicy mellowness, suggesting you should order it if only to staunch the extreme burn of the Isan fare. By the way, there is an exception to the \"curries tend to be bland\" rule at Lan Larb Soho. It\\'s called jungle curry (with mock duck, $12), and you should order it with some caution. If you request it at the top of its potential hotness — the waitress is likely to offer you a four or five point spiciness scale — it will be like a flamethrower aimed at your mouth.

But beyond his juggernaut of influence—the ever-proliferating restaurants in America and abroad, Lucky Peach magazine, the line of Asian condiments he’ll soon unleash on the world—there is still the joy of returning to eat at his first business, Momofuku Noodle Bar in the East Village. He opened it in 2004 and struggled at first with his ramen recipes, working with a distributor to hone the noodle’s soft-chewy texture and ditching tradition in favor of a pork bone broth that blew bacony steam onto diner’s faces.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'He also added other dishes to the menu beyond noodle bowls, creations that reflected his Korean heritage, his Virginia upbringing, and his time cooking in kitchens like Craft and Cafe Boulud. From his rookie panic and resolve for success came creations like rice cakes in chile sauce with caramelized onions and—they need no introduction—steamed Chinese buns swabbed with hoisin and folded around pork belly squares with scallions and cucumber. Within a year the restaurant would be a phenomenon. Chang’s style merged cultures and dining formats in fresh ways. His bar with the plywood wall that bent the mind serving such sophisticated flavors? It helped to strike a crack in upscale formality that spread until the genre shattered.',\n",

       "  'A decade of fetishism and imitation later, I’m so sick of pork belly buns that my vision blurs when they appear on menus. I only want to eat them at Noodle Bar to savor their archetypal rightness: the airy squish to the bun, the ratio of dense meat and tremulous fat, the sweet sauce colliding with oniony sharpness and clean-tasting cucumber. Order a bunch of dishes and the buns often arrive first. Nothing compares to the original but other persuasive variations entice, including an oily-crisp shrimp cake with spicy mayo, pickled red onions (sometimes they’re shallots) and shredded iceberg lettuce.',\n",
       "  'Last month the restaurant served a weeklong menu celebrating its tenth anniversary, lugging out some beloved recipes from previous head chefs. Garlicky smoked chicken wings were worth returning to the rotation, as was a witty riff on caprese salad with tofu masquerading as mozzarella and pungent shiso subbing for basil. The chile-slaked rice cakes with their jammy onions made a triumphant return, too.',\n",

Other ramen efforts in the city surpass Noodle Bar these days, but don’t discount the contentment this bowl still delivers. The egg’s yolk enriches and smooths the broth, and the bevy of textures (frilly shoulder, firm belly, pleasantly spongy fish cake, the yielding noodles) ensures that every spoonful is varied. Share another bowl with an eye out for contrast, like the zingy ginger-scallion noodles topped with shiitakes and the cucumbers that the kitchen quick-cures with sugar and salt.',\n",

       " [\"\\n  Long before there was a Faviken, a Relae, or even a Noma, many refined gastronauts came to appreciate Nordic food in a very different way than we understand it today thanks to a groundbreaking restaurant called Aquavit. No, not all culinary institutions age gracefully; just making it to a decade is a triumph. And so that's why I'm happy to report that 27 years after it opened, Hakan Swahn's Manhattan establishment still kicks ass, with a new chef, Emma Bengtsson, who turns out to be a serious gastronomic force to be reckoned with. And really, who could doubt a restaurant named after Swedish vodka?\\n  \",\n",
       "  \"Icy shots (I repeat, shots) of that alcoholic beverage still flow freely here — when was the last time you had shots at Per Se? The caraway and fennel-infused spirit is precisely what to drink with Bengtsson's scallop and sea urchin, a duo of crustaceans that tastes right and relevant even if there's nothing new about this pairing. The diver scallop, one-dimensional and cloying elsewhere, exhibits a powerful brininess here, with a hint of sugar from the Maine urchin and a lick of acidity from a pungent vinaigrette. The whole affair, colored in swaths of green, red, white, and orange, ends up looking like a psychedelic tidal pool somewhere in the North Atlantic, a magical place where the ocean tastes like good balsamic.\",\n",
       "  'Top: Place setting; Left: Sweetbreads with compressed blue cheese foan; Right: Torched langostines with hay-smoked oysters. All photos by Daniel Krieger',\n",
       "  \"And so here, alas, it's worth giving credit to the Michelin Guide for putting Aquavit back on my radar, a feat it accomplished by bestowing a rare honor upon Bengtsson — two stars. That makes her the second woman in America, after Dominique Crenn, to receive that accolade.\",\n",
       "  'She\\'s not the first chef to make a name for herself at Aquavit. The Midtown mainstay, which opened in 1987 at a Rockefeller townhouse on 54th St., garnered national acclaim in the 1990s under the auspicious reign of chef Marcus Samuelsson, an Ethiopian-born Swede whose \"New Scandinavian Cuisine,\" took a global view of Northern European fare, an approach that resulted in one of the most memorable meals of my life in 2003. I remember Kumamoto oysters with curry mango sorbet, cured salmon with tandoori spices, smoked arctic char in a Japanese-like mushroom consomme, and on a later visit, foie gras lava cake.',\n",
       "  \"But now, at the 55th St. digs (Aquavit relocated in 2005), we get a different approach to Scandinavia. There's crispy cod skin with bleak roe, fragrant rye crisps with fennel seeds, and bacon-topped pig's blood cakes — the flavor of boudin noir times five.\",\n",
       "  'Gravlax with smoke and roe',\n",
       "  'Bengtsson, who was previously pastry chef at Aquavit, is continuing the good work of her predecessor, Marcus Jernmark, in producing fare that\\'s leaner, more focused, and more Swedish than Samuelsson\\'s. Her cooking is a happy midpoint between classic European cuisine and the strongly indigenous \"no olive oil let\\'s use sea buckthorn\" New Nordic ethos espoused by Noma\\'s René Redzepi. That means no tandoori spices on Bengtsson\\'s chopped gravlax, just a classic hay smoke (for a hint of sweetness), and a garnish of roe (for textural pop and a clean punch of oil). It\\'s nothing groundbreaking. It\\'s just perfect.',\n",
       "  \"There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York.\",\n",
       "  \"Is Aquavit's food as exciting and compelling as the offerings at Atelier Crenn, Atera, Blanca, Elizabeth, Annisa, the late Aska, or Manresa? Not necessarily, and perhaps that's where Michelin and this critic would disagree. Aquavit's pedestrian, 5 - 6oz lamb chop has no place on an ambitious tasting. And while brined cod with fried anchovy is straight up FlavorTown, the 4oz portion, on the same menu as the lamb, is another gut buster. That's up to ten ounces of protein in two consecutive courses. Not cool. But still. There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York. The price is right too, with a five-course menu at $95, and an eight-course tasting at $135. Order the longer menu, as that's the only way to sample the epic sweetbread preparation. The duck-fat cooked organs are wrapped in compressed fuji apples and topped with a blue cheese foam — an accidental fondue course. Another highlight: barley risotto with summer truffles, as a rich, earthy, al dente porridge.\",\n",
       "  'Heirloom tomatoes with horseradish snow',\n",
       "  \"And for those who haven't dropped by Aquavit in a while, note that the former dining room, a windowless affair that evoked an executive lounge in Corporate Purgatory, is now reserved for private events. Guests now enjoy their three-hour tastings up front in the old bistro room, an airier space overlooking 55th Street. Smart move.\",\n",
       "  \"Another bonus: Should you bring a pocketbook or backpack into the dining room, the wait staff will provide a raccoon fur-covered stool for it to rest upon. It's the type of adornment one might expect for a restaurant that smells like a campfire, which this one does, thanks to a ubiquitous (albeit judicious) use of smoke throughout the meal, perfuming striped bass (good), leek and potato soup (very good) and Swiss chard-wrapped duck leg (even better).\",\n",
       "  \"That duck leg, incidentally, plays a supporting role to a breast boasting such densely crispy skin that I'm halfway tempted to call it the new archetype for this dish throughout the city. And amping up the iron-y funk are tiny bits of crispy duck skin scattered throughout the plate. Cleanse the palate with chili mango aquavit and the evening starts to take on a warm glow.\",\n",
       "  'Arctic Nest; Petit fours',\n",
       "  'The evening improves further with the arrival of the Arctic Nest, a naturalistic riff on the classic Aquavit dessert. In the past guests were served a cylinder of goat fromage parfait topped with blueberry sorbet and a swooping honey tuile. It looked like a modernist sculpture in an overpriced Danish design store. Bengtsson, in turn, has reimagined that delicacy as a goat cheese egg, filled with a \"sea buckthorn\" yolk and all nestled in a tangle of tuiles shaped to resemble a proper avian abode. The tart-sweet-crunchy combo is as good as ever, and so is Aquavit. Finish off with pate de fruit flavored like \"Sour Patch Kids\" and raise a glass to Hakan Swahn for continuing to make his restaurant a breeding ground for important New York chefs.'],\n",

The two cultures' foodways entwine effortlessly, given their mutual agrarian roots, long growing seasons, and devotion to pork and vegetables. Frank Stitt, an early adapter, opened Birmingham's Bottega in 1988 and still serves collusions like grouper with fregola sarda, Sea Island peas from South Carolina, currants, and pine nuts. Earlier this year Hugh Acheson debuted The Florence in Savannah, where trout comes with rice grits and salmoriglio (Southern Italy's answer to pesto) and tagliatelle entangles pork belly and burrata.

He spent part of his childhood in Belgium and lived near families who'd immigrated from the Boot. He learned to make pasta from Italians he worked alongside in a Swiss hotel-culinary school. After nearly a decade in Florida (he earned four James Beard noms for his cooking at Fish Out of Water on Santa Rosa Beach), he moved to Nashville in 2012, launching his own restaurant at the base of a loft building refashioned from a century-old factory.\",\n",

Just relax into his soothing, country-cool cooking. Those agonolotti are masterful, the triangles of al dente pasta giving way to the gush of pureed, dairy-rich beans. Krajeck's signature is squid ink canestri, a ridged macaroni (the preferred pasta shape of Southerners). He pairs it these days with 'nduja (the Calabrian-inspired salumi with the consistency of deviled ham), clams, and breadcrumbs nearly the size of small croutons.\",\n",

Start with the $5 house-baked sourdough served with butter given an umami left hook by whipping it with momoya (Japanese seaweed paste)—a prime example of why exceptional bread service is worth charging for. Toasted slices act as crostini for punchy dry-aged beef tartare, angled over a pool of salsa verde. Another wheaty wonder: Freekeh (the young, roasted grain) is the foundation of a stunner scattered with slivered green tomatoes and cucumbers, torn parsley and mint, and a healthy dose of the Turkish chile urfa biber.',\n",

Krajeck takes pride in his whole-animal pig cookery, and his mixed roast of pork includes lean pork loin, fat-stippled belly, and sausage with smart seasonal fillips like green peanut stew and halved okra seared hard enough to dispel its sliminess.

Once the home of a cotton tycoon, the Italian Renaissance-style property welcomed the public in 1980 and directly established itself as a playground for socialites and billionaires at a time when the city was drenched in oil money. The reputation cemented. Even at a time when fine dining is downscaling (and Dallas' trend toward casual took root later than in most cities) the Mansion remains synonymous with occasion and indulgence.\\n  \",\n",
       "  \"Much of that has to do with the restaurant's reputation for doting service (particularly enjoyed by regulars) and with the three unusually gifted chefs who led the kitchen over the last thirty years. Dean Fearing came on as executive chef in 1984, catapulting the restaurant's fame. He worked the dining room in his chef's whites and cowboy boots while pushing forward the era's Southwestern cuisine craze with luxurious tortilla soup and lobster tacos. He stayed for 21 years, sometimes veering into rococo fusion flings (imagine fried quail surrounded by pot stickers, egg salad, and gingered rice salad) before leaving in 2006 to open Fearing's, with its four stunning themed rooms, in the Ritz-Carlton Dallas.\",\n",

Tesar moved on in early 2009 (he currently operates two Dallas restaurants, Spoon and Knife); Bruno Davaillon, previously at Alain Ducasse's Mix at the Hotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, replaced him nine months later. Davaillon hails from the Touraine area of France's Loire Valley. He isn't an extrovert like his predecessors and stays close to the stoves. But he has the same degree of virtuoso talent.\",\n",

The kitchen offers an a la carte menu, but when most appetizers are priced over $20 and mains cost $38 to $59, you might as well go for one of four five-course tasting menus themed to vegetables ($85), seafood ($95), and meat ($105), or the \"gourmand\" ($115) that covers the protein gamut.

It mixed French and Lone Star State aesthetics and hinted at the exotic. It telegraphed Davaillon's headspace as a chef: His imagination meanders but his technique is classical and micro-detailed. The sculptured courses that came next traveled the world of flavors, but the kitchen's precision gave the meal a cohesive arch. Dashi broth and gelee, cubed daikon, and a sprinkling of buckwheat offset the richness of cauliflower panna cotta and caviar.

The siblings brought aboard Jason Franey as executive chef in 2008. Franey worked as Daniel Humm's sous chef at Manhattan's Eleven Madison Park, and the Canlises intended him to push the menu in more progressive directions.

We had the choice of ordering three- or four-course meals with options in every category (starters, entrees, desserts), or a set seven-course chef's tasting menu that required both of us to order it. In hindsight, the tasting menu—with dishes that night like matsutake mushrooms with chicken liver mousse, Sauternes, and purslane—would have likely delivered more modernism. The regular menu read docile and familiar: heirloom tomato salad with mozzarella, watermelon, and arugula; butternut squash with brown butter and sage; lamb with potato rösti and carrots. Continental classics filled out the offerings, and I have a soft spot for well-executed vintage dishes, so we largely charged ahead on that path.\",\n",

Fresh mint added a distinctive glint to this Americana charmer. Prawns splayed in a tidy row were dappled with a sauce of vermouth, lime, and a whisper of garlic. Wagyu New York strip delivered plenty of char and sanguine savor. We ordered its faithful chophouse companion alongside: twice-baked mashed potatoes, fluffy with sour cream and riddled with more bacon. This was Continental without the theatrical frisson\\xa0of a place like La Grenouille, but it was a spread that my four-year-old nephew or my 88-year-old grandmother would equally appreciate.

Inside was the odd protein combination of ground pork and shrimp and masses of steaming beansprouts. It was delicious, a definition of mellowness. \"This giant version is a city thing.

Striped from the grill and smoky tasting, the pork glistened with sautéed scallions; crushed peanuts were heaped on top. Alongside came fresh basil, lime wedges, lettuce leaves, and pickled daikon and carrot. The idea is to select combinations of ingredients and wrap them up inside the leaves, then dip them in the fishy vinegar called nouc cham, goosed up with hot chiles or hoisin at your discretion. As Mai delightedly pointed out, \"This is something that is served at weddings.\" Indeed, the process of assembling and eating banh hoi tends to make you feel happy and talkative.',\n",

Don\\'t worry, it won\\'t turn you into a vampire. The rice noodles are thicker and looser than pho, so light you can have a mouthful and almost not be aware of it.

From among two dozen permutations, one is well advised to order the deluxe xe lua ($7.25), which contains the full catalog of beef additions in a complex broth with cinnamon and star anise accents. What does \"xe lua\" mean? I asked my Vietnamese friend on that first visit. \"It means ‘fire car,\\'\" she explained with a smile.

Nashville, though, does have dibs on the genre known as hot chicken. Sure, a flicker of pepper or chile may be a standard part of most recipes. Gus’s fried chicken in Memphis famously swats the taste buds with a cayenne backhand. But Nashville hot chicken is something else altogether. The final product comes doused in a shellac of lava capsicum (often laced with lard), turning it a deeper, scarier crimson than Buffalo wings could ever hope to achieve.\\n  ',\n",

To taste the prototype, a trip to Prince’s Hot Chicken is mandatory. Current owner Andre Prince Jeffries can’t say exactly how long the family has been in the chicken business (she estimates since the 1940s), but she tells a great tale about founder Thornton Prince III. It seems Thornton was fond of the ladies, and after staying out too late one Saturday night he came home in the morning to find his girlfriend preparing the traditional Sunday chicken. But she had a surprise for him: She’d saturated the chicken with chile powder to inflict pain. Instead, he loved it, and eventually began selling his version.',\n",

Don’t arrive in a hurry: The staff makes each batch of chicken to order. There are half a dozen tables. Many people take their meal to go, but for maximum savor—when the chicken is hot in temperature as well as seasoning—stake out somewhere to sit.',\n",

It took about 40 minutes from the time we arrived until our first bite. The medium, for those of us who appreciate spice but don’t crave daredevil extremes, smoldered pleasantly. My mouth thrummed, but it didn’t set off alarms. The hot, however, took it to the edge. First there was a fleeting \"no big deal\" reaction: The spices felt gritty-dusty against the tongue, and I registered the skin’s crispness, the vegetal flavor of the chiles, and the juicy flesh underneath. Then the fire began raging and the involuntary reactions kicked in. My nose tingled. My scalp felt prickly. I was suddenly gushing sweat, and so were my friends. Bites of creamy (otherwise mediocre) potato salad became our burn salve. All that said? We polished off both chickens.

The hot version did sting, but through the cayenne’s blaze the nuances of black pepper, garlic powder, and paprika helped round out the flavors.

Trout roe adds pop, cucumber juice lends astringency, and dollops of cream steeped with marigold and lemon mint (also the flowers and herb in the glass) emit an herbal pheromone.

An essay on lamb—loin cloaked in belly fat and roasted, pickled tongue—was punctuated with artichoke heart chips braised in brown butter, smoked paprika gastrique, curling white anchovies, frisee, and oxalis, a lemony herb that's part of the sorrel family. The evening's crowning glory was gorgeously marbled beef from Japan's Miyazaki prefecture. Duffy loves this protein and has concocted several stagings for it; this one was in the form of a deconstructed Thai beef salad. Raw and cooked forms of the meat hid among a forest of herbs, romaine lettuce cooked into marmalade, and peanuts both caramelized and pureed. Citrusy tom yum broth, poured tableside, provided the soprano line to the meat's baritone smoothness.\",\n",

This is the first time the kitchen has used it in a sweet dish, and it was wondrous: Braised and fresh white peaches, cream cheese ice cream, and Champagne foam filled the tea canister, which held its form but could also be easily sliced with a spoon. A lot going on, but the purity of the flavors gave me the same innocent happiness as eating a drippy peach over the kitchen sink.',\n",

       "  \"In 1987, the same year Bayless published his first tome, Authentic Mexican, he and his wife Deann (who also co-penned the book) opened midscale Frontera Grill. It bridged the gap for Middle America, eschewing the combo plate but luring customers with smoky wafts from the grill fueled by hardwood coal, build-your-own tacos, and enigmatic moles. Precision-engineered margaritas smoothed the conversion. Two years later the Baylesses launched fine-dining Topolobampo in a room off one side of Frontera. It was the sophisticated approach to Mexican cuisine that Bayless had wanted to take in the first place, though he was smart enough to know he needed to first win over palates with Frontera's accessibility. He wooed at Topolo via saucing: wild turkey breast with heady chocolate mole, mahi mahi with poblano cream, empanadas napped in avocado puree.\",\n",
       "  \"Topolo is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary this fall. Since then, Bayless has opened other restaurants, including a second location of casual torta shop Xoco in Chicago's Wicker Park last month (the original Xoco is next to Topolobampo) and two locations—with a third on the way—of his Mexi-Cali concept Red O in Los Angeles. Checking in on the siblings that became icons, I Bayless-binged by lunching at Frontera Grill and then having dinner at Topolo.\",\n",

       "  \"One of my closest friends, a Chicago native, took me to Frontera Grill on my first visit to the city in 1990. We stood huddled in the cold outside, waiting in line, and the restaurant's spasm of primary colors and campfire scents thawed us as soon as we shuffled through the door. I remember being mesmerized not just by the warmth of the flavors but the exactness of the food's seasoning: the fastidious ratios of salt and citrus in the ceviche, the black mole's dusky-sweet alchemy, the revelation of fresh corn tortillas. Eating at Frontera was an awakening.\",\n",
       "  \"The same friend and I are having lunch at Frontera over two decades later. We're wiser now: We arrived at the restaurant at 11:20 a.m., ten minutes before opening, to beat the wait. She wants all the classics: guacamole, smoked chicken taquitos, tacos, the killer chocolate-pecan pie with Kahlua whipped cream hat's been a staple since the restaurant's first month. I'm eyeing the novelties that frequently revolve through the menu and keep the kitchen's energy kindled. We order some of everything.\",\n",
       "  \"Part of Bayless's savvy as a restaurateur has been to distill his years of research into menus that provide all-inclusive tours of Mexican cookery. Oaxacan chile-marinated steaks and Mexico City-style quesadillas that resemble cornmeal turnovers share the spotlight with Veracruz salsas and Yucatan ceviches. Rather than a regional immersion, it all blurs into a satisfying whole. And the kitchen sometimes takes creative liberties with staples. Beyond the standard guacamole, for example, there are seasonal variations: We try one with fresh habaneros, grilled onions, roasted garlic, sour orange (popular in the Yucatan), and minty hoja santa as an intriguing departure from cilantro. The description sounds cacophonous but the flavors mellow and merge harmoniously.\",\n",

       "  \"Not every dish electrifies, though; the kitchen doesn't seem as rigorous with its execution as it once was. The flavors in the Frontera ceviche—albacore tuna with tomatoes, olives, and cilantro—are muddier than I remember, and the Oaxacan sopes filled with shredded beef aren't as wonderfully crisp. The lunch's most exciting effort is a study in duck: rosy breast in date mole (dates are an important crop in Baja California) with ancho chile to offset the sweet spices, and garnishes of duck prosciutto and duck chicarron that further balance with their earthiness.\",\n",

The sweets have always been the least truly Mexican dishes at the restaurant, but it doesn't matter. Frontera is like an old friend at this point. Maybe the cooks could more finely tune their final results (a constant challenge in such an always-mobbed place) and perhaps nostalgia fuels some of the enjoyment, but Frontera is still worlds better than most of the country's serious Mexican restaurants. 445 Clark Street, 312-661-1434, fronteragrill.com.

He refreshed the sanctuary of a room with subtle decor tweaks, ordered new tableware (a mix of Bernardaud china and handmade Mexican pottery), and most notably changed the dining format. Rather than starters and mains, the kitchen makes every plate the same size and groups the menu into categories of dishes that reflect their defining characteristics: \"fresh,\" \"enchanting,\" \"complex,\" \"luxurious.\" Three, five, or seven courses are standard, though the engaging staff will happily customize the meal to however many dishes you\\'d like.',\n",

I\\'m not exactly sure what it means that I was drawn to \"ancient\" and \"soulful,\" but the attraction brought haunting pleasures like goat barbacoa in a broth of braising juices and red chiles, strewn with chickpeas cooked just to the point of creaminess and with radishes for crisp, juicy counterpoint. Roasted purple potatoes achieved similarly profound flavor steeped in chileatole, a cross between a soup and a beverage thickened with corn masa and aromatic from guajillo chiles and musky epazote. One more meaty wonder: blushing lamb shoulder braised in hatch chiles (leaving traces of vegetal smokiness), flanked by wilted amaranth greens and sauced with red chile gravy and bone marrow-enriched potato crema. Chef de cuisine Andres Padilla knows how to romance the proteins.',\n",
       "  'These dishes succeeded so richly because they conjured the comforts of rustic Mexican cooking—the slow heat, the spicy insinuations. The most memorable creations stayed that course. A dish called \"Flowers and Cheese\" was comely but surprised with its intricacy: homemade queso fresco and sungold tomatoes hid under a \"masa veil,\" which was like a tamale rolled flat and crisped. Toasted ancho chile and browned butter gave the composition some heft, and the spray of edible herbs and flowers atop were of course from Bayless\\'s rooftop garden overhead. When a dish\\'s theme wandered too far, it disappointed. Lemon-tequila ice cream wasn\\'t enough to wrangle a fiddly, deconstructed raspberry shortcake back to the fold.

With South Indian establishments now dominating, the two-block strip boasts the metropolitan area’s most concentrated collection of vegetarian restaurants, 11 out of a total of 22. And even the places that serve meat offer extensive vegetarian menus – it’s what South Indian diners demand. While dedicated dosa parlors like Sri Ganesha’s and Dosa Hut tender dozens of variations of the potato-stuffed pancake, more interesting perhaps are the restaurants that seek to cover the entire range of regional South Indian vegetarian fare. Sapthagiri was the first; now we have Chutneys.\\n  ',\n",

The table settings include stainless steel drinking glasses, water pitchers, and chutney caddies offering a lavish assortment of six. Included are an unusual curry-leaf chutney, a generous cup of ghee, a zippy tomato chutney, and a spicy peanut powder that you might want to dump on everything.

For something more byzantine, head for \"Chutney’s classic dosa,\" which is anything but classic: the filling runs to the frankly bizarre mixture of potatoes, raw baby spinach, crumbled paneer, cubed carrots, and melted cheddar. For the curator of obscure regional oddities, the steamed dosa ($8.99) might be the perfect thing. Rather than being fried thin and crisp, this pancake has been cooked in a steamer to something pale and spongy. Be forewarned it lacks the usual oniony potato filling; in fact, it lacks any filling at all. Then there’s MLA pesarattu, a mung-bean flapjack flavored with cumin and ginger. In this case the filling is upma – a cream of rice doctored with butter, chiles, and black mustard seeds that can be purchased separately ($6.99), making an excellent stoner’s breakfast.',\n",

The curries on Chutneys’ menu will be familiar to anyone accustomed to eating Indian food on, say, the Upper West Side, with the exception of a few of the crazier ones, such as kaju masala, featuring cashews bobbing in tomato sauce. Another equally novel curry is aimed at Jains, a religious group that eschews onions and garlic. Nilgiri korma ($9.99) glows an eerie shade of green, a diverse collection of vegetables in a sauce of pureed fresh mint. Don’t worry, it doesn’t taste like toothpaste!',\n",

A friend who grew up in Houston but often returned to India to visit his family in Bangalore pointed to the mellifluous-sounding bis bela bath ($7.99) and exclaimed, \"My grannie makes that. I never expected to find it on an Indian menu in New Jersey.\" This delectable damp risotto of crushed rice and veggies in a shredded coconut sauce is scented with asafoetida: a tree resin that tastes like onions, which gave the English language the word \"fetid.\"',\n",

To magnify their essence, Moran and his cooks lightly brined and dried the tomatoes for two days, until their color turned bloody but the texture remained lush. They shaved on grizzled specimens from The Hamery in Murfreesboro, Tennessee; it looked like rousong (a.k.a. Chinese pork floss) and tasted, pleasantly, of mineral and funk. Tomato water flavored with tomato vinegar and lemon verbena oil created a fragrant moat.\\n  ',\n",

After apprenticing at The Catbird Seat for six months, he replaced departing chef Erik Anderson in January. Anderson—along with Josh Habiger, who left The Catbird Seat to help run the new dining and entertainment complex Pinewood Social (the two share owners)—earned raves almost as soon as the restaurant opened in 2011. They had stints at Alinea, Noma, The French Laundry, and The Fat Duck between them, and they created wizardly tasting menus that mashed local and global flavors with modernist wit. Their most famous creation was often the meal’s first bite: an ode to Nashville hot chicken in the form of fried chicken skin seasoned with sorghum, Korean chile flakes, dill powder, and a winky puree of Wonder bread.',\n",
       "  'Left: Cobia in sweet potato broth, Right: Ice cream salad with sorrel',\n",
       "  'The city’s restaurant boom has already detonated, but Anderson and Habiger’s daring achieved another level of cachet altogether. No one in the sweep of the country between Washington DC’s Minibar and Houston’s Oxheart had previously pulled off this kind of high-minded cuisine. It succeeded in part because Nashville is a city of performers. Two chefs preparing dinner center-stage in an intimate space and then delivering theatrical (and delectable) dishes to a counter-side audience? The format resonated.',\n",
       "  'Thrillingly, Moran stepped into the spotlight and has made the platform his own. He bandies his share of culinary bons mots—whipped fondue spiked with PBR comes in a cone made from crushed bar nuts, a hillbilly homage to Thomas Keller—but he uses his Noma training to stunning effect. For tartare, he blends dry-aged strip loin with grains like quinoa, buckwheat, forbidden rice, and sourdough bread crumbs; dapples the mixture with blackberries for sour-sweetness and green peanut oil for richness; and decorates the bowl with citrus begonias that, beyond their beauty, also lend a rhubarb-like astringency. He simmers small potatoes just to the edge of tenderness, and then serves them in a broth buoyed with ale yeast from local Yazoo Brewing Company, thickened with smoked bread, and smoothed with crème fraîche.',\n",

The cooks kept us engaged in descriptions and conversations, but not so much that it distracted from the pleasures at hand—literally. Much of the food is eaten without utensils; it would have been wonderful if the staff had presented hand towels when the evening started. For a superb finale, pastry pro Kelly White assembled discs of moist cake arranged with last-of-the-season blueberries from Saskatchewan (far superior to most Southern blueberries, so I didn't mind the distance these traveled), elderflower spheres, and orbs of cucumber.\",\n",
       "  'A refreshing closer, but there was one more dish to come. Kartoffelkage is a Danish pastry. The word means \"potato cake\" but refers to the shape; there are no spuds in the original recipe. In a nod to his Irish heritage, Moran added it by whipping mashed potato as part of an airy custard that he piped into an tuber-shaped choux pastry glossed with marzipan. I usually wince at edible soil, but this number did look awfully cute sitting in a paper bag on a bed of crushed cookies with cocoa nibs, powdered trumpet mushrooms, and tonka beans.

The flames concealed logs of parsnip and pork belly wrapped in kombu seaweed. Servers plucked them from the fire and unwrapped tableside—a flambé flourish for the new millennium.

The ceremony was preceded by a brief dialogue on how the flavor of the brew would’ve been different had the Chinese product been harvested at a different altitude, and just in case there was any confusion, the gentleman overseeing the rituals handed me his business card, on which was printed a single, Portlandia-esque title: “Tea Curator.” You’ve got to be kidding me.\\n  ',\n",

I lived in Seattle in the late 1990s and haven't spent much time here since, but eating at Sitka & Spruce helped fill in the years. This is a place to linger to absorb the city's essence.

Yet Ricker, with four restaurants in Portland and three in New York, has proven to be a careful translator with mass appeal. He's troweled and deconstructed recipes during two decades of travel to Thailand (and counting), and his replicas hit the hot spots of our modern palate. Ricker's signature charcoal-roasted hen — garlicky, stuffed with lemongrass, and served with sharp, puckery dipping sauces with ingredients like tamarind — opens a portal to fiercer, funkier pleasures such as chopped duck salad, the bird's liver offset by an uppercut of lime juice and fish sauce.\",\n",

We crossed the street to Ricker's Whiskey Soda Lounge, which launched in 2009 as a valve release for the mounting pressures on Pok Pok. It soon developed its own personality, serving Thai pub snacks and cocktails potent and acidic enough to keep up with the spice and heat. It would be tempting to settle in for dinner at the bar, its back wall painted a shade of tropical turquoise that makes one long for a swim, and graze through the list of nearly 20 dishes.\",\n",

Miang kham made an ideal early-evening nibble: minced clusters of chiles, ginger, peanuts, dried shrimp, coconut, and lime were bound in a sauce that included palm sugar, tamarind, and shrimp paste and then placed on pepper betel leaves. Like so many of Ricker's recreations, it had more ingredients than the brain can easily absorb, but it tasted more harmonious with every bite. I sipped a cocktail made with mekhong, the Thai spirit largely distilled with sugar cane but also infused with rice for a sneaky aftertaste that recalls sake.\",\n",

Our server was tall and serious and took unusual pride in pacing out our meal so the plates never piled up. What struck me was the symphonic balance in every dish. Chiang Mai sausage, for example, soared with fluty lemongrass and galangal and boomed with fish sauce and chile while ground pork shoulder and belly took the melody. Fresh turmeric and cilantro gave it painterly color. Green chile dipping sauce and pork rinds echoed the flavors. It was cooking that doubled as tabletop performance.',\n",
       "  'The finesse extended to the dishes that weren\\'t strictly Thai. The restaurant\\'s famous chicken wings were as narcotic as expected. Ricker\\'s first employee, Ich \"Ike\" Truong, hailed from Vietnam. To the Pok Pok repertoire he contributed a snack of marinated wings fried and then tossed in a wok until set in amber of fish sauce, sugar, and chile paste. Bits of caramelized garlic were caught in the stickiness. And Ricker\\'s take on Cha Ca La Vong, a catfish salad of sorts inspired by a restaurant in Hanoi that serves this one specialty, was a marvel of satisfactions. Golden hunks of fish (the hue in part stemming from oil tinted with turmeric) contrasted with herbs in turn bitter, earthy, and sweet; rice noodles underneath entertained the teeth.',\n",

Then, in 2008, the financial crisis hit. Veritas shuttered in 2013 and became Élan in June, selling affordable duck burgers and confining the majority of its wine list to bottles under $105.

It was a fine dining spot that would, along with Drew Nieporent's Montrachet, help establish downtown not just as a destination for fine dining but for fine living as well. Chanterelle's menus were handwritten (in English, no less) and there was no dress code, a stark contrast to jacket-and-tie joints like Lutece, La Caravelle, and La Côte Basque. Such policies all helped usher in an era of more relaxed haute-gastronomy that everyone from Gramercy Tavern (across the street from Élan) to Craft (around the block) owes a bit gratitude toward.\",\n",

No, it doesn't have springy texture or head-turning clarity of flavor as April Bloomfield's better version at The Breslin, but it gets the job done.

First there's the decor; the owners looked to Wes Anderson's The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou for the twee, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic.

When he opened Fore Street in 1996, it helped set Portland's now-roaring dining scene into motion. Hayward was an early champion of the locavore aesthetic.

Case in point: the newly opened Slab in former Portland Public Market building, which serves Sicilian-inspired street food. Stephen Lanzalotta made his name at a local grocery store, baking billowy loafs of flatbread that share little in common with the dense, rectangular pies often served in Italian-American restaurants. To launch Slab, Lanzalotta teamed with four business partners, including Jason Loring, chef-owner of nearby Nosh Kitchen Bar. The beverage of choice is beer, with twenty rotating (and mostly local) brews on tap.',\n",

But it was, and the hits didn't stop there. Sicilian is most often referenced as the ancestral homeland of Sunday gravy, and the restaurant duly offers a mean meatball sandwich. But the cuisine is also knotty from centuries of conquest, including from Arab colonists who brought their crops to the island. Lanzalotta honors the heritage with Sicilian street food dishes like hummus, an edifying variation seasoned with whole crushed oranges, turmeric, fried sage, a mere scent of cinnamon, and homemade tahini.

To attempt a cuisine so arduously local in a climate that is bitter much of the year, it's no surprise that Levi looks to the New Nordic movement for inspiration. He staged at both Copenhagen's Noma and Sweden's Fäviken. His dining room has an appealing, natural minimalism—light woods, knobby birch twigs covering sound-muffling panels. Though he still likes them crafted as close as possible, Levi makes concessions for alcohol. There are wines from Slovenia and France and Italy, though a cocktail like the Pine Gimlet (Barr Hill gin from Vermont, condensed yogurt whey, white pine syrup) evokes a satisfying sense of place. \",\n",

The menu of small plates can be ordered a la carte or in five courses for sixty dollars. Some of it is splendid, like a smooth herb soup refreshing with cucumber and dots of locally processed sunflower oil. A plate of chicken—white and dark meat in a shallow pool of rich stock with squash and an herb sauce earthy with sage—was so satisfying my group ordered a second round, but largely because many of the other dishes had left us wanting.

A lovely stack of shaved fennel with yogurt and cucumber needed salt and acid: Could a gentle vinegar be made useful? The elements on an arty plate of pork belly with blueberry splatters, grits, pickle, and pork rind never quite came together. A bowl of blueberries lolling in custard sounded like a comforting finale, but steeping the custard in anise hyssop made the custard astringent and unpleasant.\",\n",

Ciminieri, who owns Totonno’s with siblings Antoinette Balzano and Frank Balzano, secured enough bank loans and help from the community to resurrect the place in five months. Sietsema has visited more than once post-Sandy and said the pizza was as sublime as ever. (He didn’t recognize the pizzaiolo on duty that day.) There were heartening sights: the room filled with families and couples, the walls lined with framed clippings from decades of praise, and Ciminieri zigzagging around in her lovably gruff way. Too bad the pies didn’t reach anywhere near their usual distinction.',\n",

Salads transcend any specific mealtime. One recent example combined varieties of tomato with cucumber shavings, sesame seeds, and a smooth pesto feral with garlic. Rotating egg dishes mimic lunch counter breakfast specials. A melted slice of American cheese clings to an egg cooked sunny-side up and draped over half of a croissant.

The popular Dakine rotates on and off the menu but particularly appeals at brunch with its sweet-savory repartee—a 2.0 take on the Hawaiian with slivers of fresh pineapple, mozzarella, ricotta, extra hammy prosciutto cotto, and splotches of jalapeño. Ours came pockmarked in all the right ways. The lip was pouty without heading into Meg Ryan territory.',\n",

Trust him. The fortified wine smells of burnt sugar and looks like a glass of dessert, though it’s dry on the palate, with a concentrated nuttiness to match the acorn aromas of good Iberico.

That’s not to say a shorter no-choice menu doesn’t work every now and then; budget gourmet restaurants like Le Chateubriand\\xa0\\xa0in Paris\\xa0(€65) or Contra on Manhattan’s Lower East Side ($55) make good cases for this format, because they serve visually stunning and boundary-pushing fare worthy of discussion. Huertas doesn’t. That's not a criticism.

This isn't a mythical destination. It's a big-hearted, 40-seat anchor for the community, and locals use it as such. While I diligently ate half of the menu, the table to the left turned twice, and the one to the right moved couples through three times over. People came in, ordered a dozen or so oysters, slurped them with a cocktail or a glass of flinty white, shared at most two compelling small plates, and then moved right along with their evenings.\",\n",

Servers here don't keep the pace quite so synchronized. And the restaurant, in Seattle's community-minded Wallingford neighborhood, has a European airiness.

More to the point, Erickson and her crew take the Walrus's culinary aesthetic and push the ideas further here: Dishes are saucier, riskier, and the flavors zigzag more sharply. Whiffs of smokiness clung to a generous bowl of roasted clams on my visit. Corn, onion, and butter sweetened their white wine broth, with shiso lending its minty mystery. Dill was strewn atop like seaweed washed ashore. A shimmery eggplant puree cushioned a fetching hill of beans—chickpeas, white beans, and pole beans, with corn adding texture and a dusting of parmesan to animate the earthy flavors.\",\n",

It perched atop lentils mingled with chanterelle mushrooms, gently roasted tomatoes, and, for some astute sweetness, table grapes. A few leaves of tarragon lightened the dish with their licorice nip. The kitchen employed uncommon shrewdness with herbs in general: Clumps of parsley brightened sardines on toast slathered with curried tomato mayo (wonderful alongside the restaurant's standout pickle plate), mint brought extra zing to lamb tartare with preserved lemon and capers, and a handful of mixed herbs took the high notes in a tomato salad atop of romesco-like sauce of pureed peppers and walnuts. Even when a dish stumbled—as with a funky, muddy-tasting nectarine soup that cilantro pesto couldn't uplift—the intelligence behind the cooking was obvious.\",\n",

It sounds ideal to begin at the Walrus around twilight for oysters and then drive the 2.3 miles over to Whale to finish the night. If I could only choose one, I'd probably lean toward the Whale—but then I'm drawn to the complicated. Wiser souls might argue credibly for simplicity.\",\n",

The stroganoff achieved a similar harmony of meat and soured cream, and the use of beef tongue rescued the dish from its purgatory as a kitchen set piece on Mad Men.

Chicken rubbed with a peppery Montreal smoked meat spice blend was draped over oxtail meat, semolina gnocchi formed into a rectangle and fried, and a few green beans. The kicker on this entree?

The trippy quality of Carbone\\'s interior is a portal to Little Italy in a parallel, cinematic universe. A scene in The Godfather inspired the black-and-white patterned floor. The walls are the otherworldly blue of Mystique\\'s skin in the X-Men movies. Film director Julian Schnabel\\'s son, Vito, organized the art on the walls: Irreverent images of Michelangelo-like busts with cigarettes hanging out of their mouths, or pictures scrawled with aphorisms such as \"A black-out is nature\\'s way of sparing me the embarrassment,\" are the only overt visual clues that an archetype is being toyed with.',\n",
       "  \"The tinkering in most cases is triumphant. What's particularly fun about Carbone is that it doesn't simply pay homage to the red-sauce palaces that simmered their way into popular culture fifty years ago. It also winks at midcentury Continental cuisine and explores the ways the two genres overlapped. Gigantic, pricy, nuanced versions of Italian-American standards populate the menu: baked clams, minestrone, lobster Fra Diavolo, veal Marsala. But a retro Palm Springs coolness informs the meal, too. Cocktail clichés get chic makeovers. Chartreuse gives the rum daiquiri a femme-fatale edge; whiffs of rosemary turns a potent Gibson martini into a harbinger of the herb-rich dishes soon to fill the table.\",\n",

Baked clams in three variations begin playfully (oreganata-style with fluffy, herbaceous bread crumbs) and then go luxe, with lardo subbing for bacon on the \"casino\" variation and the third riff topped with sweet uni. Rigatoni has an appealing slipperiness that verges on gluey—a quirky quality that separates Italian-American pastas from the homeland. It comes in a tomato-vodka sauce with chile to magnify the subtle heat from the spirit. Mario Carbone crisscrosses Italian and Continental with his Ribeye Diana, a lofty spin on steak Diane in a jus that hints of cacciatore with pancetta, rosemary, and tomato paste.

At this time of year, though, East Coast blue crab is at its sweetness: Why not rename the dish and use it instead? The ending saves the show. The flames surge for our own bananas Foster, ginger icing nudges carrot cake into an exotic realm, and we sip limoncello and grappa brought to the table as part of the meal's conclusion.

We knocked back a spicy Rosso Conero Riserva from the Marche, a region of Italy where some provinces have D.O.C.G. designation and from where it's possible to fine a great bottle in a store at $20.

This level of service and pampering is becoming relatively uncommon for an a la carte venue, though admittedly you still end up paying as much at Carbone as you do at a tasting menu restaurant: Dinner for three can easily exceed $500.\",\n",

That was a damn fine steak Diane—it didn't taste dry-aged, but it had a gorgeous sweetness. Is the $55 veal parm the best I've had? No, not even close—though let the record state that I'm not a huge fan of chicken or veal parm in general. The flip side is that, during multiple separate visits to Carbone, I've encountered better veal Marsala than anywhere else -- and I've consumed my fair share of Marsala growing up on Long Island. Yes, the veal parm needs work. That aside, Carbone gets it right.\"],\n",

An early fall spread included pole beans and field peas with red onions and pickle dressing (the dirty martini as vinaigrette); half-moon zucchini slivers in tomato dressing with crunchy bits of bread somewhere in size between crumbs and croutons; and a simple, striking presentation of grilled octopus on a bed of cucumber slices with pickled chiles and mint.',\n",

Tangy cottage cheese made from buttermilk provided a novel base for pizza, matched with shards of delicata squash for contrasting sweetness and red onion for sharpness.',\n",

       "  'Our Uber ride pulls up to a storefront with graffiti over the door. The only clue that we\\'re in the right place is a frayed sign on the inside of the door with etchings of an owl, a buck\\'s head, and a diamond, with the name \"Elizabeth\" printed in cursive underneath. A soccer supply outfit sits to the left of the restaurant; the shop to the right sells new and used tires. Is this really the Michelin one-star destination for which I purchased two tickets that totaled over $350?',\n",
       "  'Welcome to the intimate, idiosyncratic domain of Iliana Regan, a chef-savant unlike any other in the U.S. Regan worked front of the house in Chicago luminaries like Trio, Tru, and Alinea before circling back to the kitchen, where she had started in the food business as a teenager. She grew up on a farm in Indiana and had learned the essentials of foraging, which she drew upon when she began an underground supper club in her apartment in 2010. \"New Gatherer\" was the term she coined for her style of cooking.',\n",
       "  \"Guests who loved the food helped her invest in the Lincoln Square space on Chicago's northern edge that became Elizabeth, named for her late older sister. She carried over the supper club vibe into the restaurant, at first offering communal seating and reservations solely through the ticketing system developed by Alinea and Next restaurateur Nick Kokonas. Open for two years this month, Regan has gradually evolved how Elizabeth operates. She did away with large-group seating in favor of two- and four-tops. Now the space feels like a rambling (if windowless) farmhouse kitchen: Regan and her corps of cooks produce dinner in plain view, under a painted pressed tin ceiling, next to clusters of thick wooden tables with mismatched chairs.\",\n",
       "  'Edible soil with compressed cucumber, buttermilk, and parsley pearls',\n",
       "  'Also, the restaurant will accept traditional reservations, though the ticketing system remains in place. And initially Regan served three different menus but has wisely streamlined it into one option—a nearly 20-course meal that evokes and venerates the Midwestern terra firma.',\n",
       "  'Honestly, it took a few dishes before I warmed to the approach. The first couple bites came in a pretty glass bowl, cradling a macaron-sized orb of red wine vinegar meringue that stood in as dressing for a mini-salad. Its contents included a bit of carrot top greens, a slice of zucchini, some cubed whey, and shards of pumpernickel. The elements seemed alien to one another. The chestnut of New Nordic cuisine, edible soil (this one composed of malt powder, hazelnut and chamomile tea), showed up next as a precise circle dotted with things like parsley pearls and compressed cucumber and tiny buds. I longed for some richness to mitigate the bleak flavors.',\n",
       "  'House-made cheese with smoked cabbage and beets; Milkweed soup with yogurt',\n",
       "  'But the cooking\\'s mood soon softened. A house-made farmers cheese of sorts, mixed with stinging nettle buddies up to petals of smoked cabbage and beets both dried and smoked. The \"bear rice crispy\" included, yes, a coin of cured bear meat, teetering atop puffed wild rice bound by curried marshmallow. Fried hen-of-the-woods mushrooms were breaded in acorns, which imparted the exact forest-floor nuttiness one might expect. A dollop of roasted garlic aioli alongside sped the dish back to civilization.',\n",
       "  'After several engaging variations on austere ingredients—maitake mushroom tea with cocoa nib and chamomile, a salad called \"weeds and whey\" (\\'nough said), milkweed soup tamed by hints of cream and yogurt—the emotional payoff for a generous plate of meat was enormous. I attacked thick, rosy slices of lamb leg like a famished lion. The summery compressed cherries and autumnal wilted greens alongside were just gravy. A series of gentle sweets followed: pine sorbet, apricot compote and dried plums over silken polenta, a pudding made from chamomile with sage-colored sassafras ice cream.',\n",

The basic  fries-gravy-cheese formula lends itself to endless high-low variations  that show up proudly on menus all over the city.\\nLa Banquise, a 24-hour diner with a Day-Glo interior, has  specialized in the dish for decades. The restaurant started in 1968 as  an ice cream shop that soon switched to hot dogs and fries. Poutine  debuted on the menu in 1980 with two versions—the traditional threesome  and an Italian variation with mozzarella and a beef-laced tomato sauce.  As demand grew, so did the variations, which now hover around 30. Many  sound questionable. To name a few: \"La Boogalou,\" with pulled pork, cole  slaw, and sour cream; L\\'Abreuvoir, featuring sliced corn dog; and the  very un-Jamaican-sounding \"La Raggae\" avalanched with ground beef,  guacamole, chiles, and diced tomatoes.\\n\\nA moat of  industrial-strength brown  gravy and bouncy cheese curds that soften  but never wholly melt.\\n\\nJust send over La Classique, merci beaucoup.

High Street\\'s red eye danish reconfigures one of Dixie\\'s classic breakfasts—country ham in a simple pan sauce jolted with coffee.

Even if you order a sandwich, consider doubling down with the $4 bread service, worth it for thick, chewy slices of anadama rich with cornmeal and rye.

Fork lays out several routes for approaching a meal: One can order a standard format of starters ($14 to $18), pastas (available in half-portions for $16 to $19 or full for $26 to $29) and mains ($28 to $48). Compose a four-course meal from the a la carte choices and dessert for $70 per person.

So many chefs concentrate their artistry into appetizers and peter out at entrees, but this meal only gained momentum. The starters were captivating enough: fluke sashimi cured with kombu, pounded like carpaccio, and draped over a curved buckwheat cracker like ghostly moss spreading across a rock. A rhubarb consommé that was refreshing and astringent but could have also used a sweet accent from strawberry. Pastas showed off the kitchen\\'s prowess, with beauties like freeform lasagna noodles slinking over molten puddles of washed-rind cheese with scattered hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and porcini powder.\\nThe duck stole the night, though it had a worthy sidekick in branzino presented \"en croute\" by fusing the fish with a plank of pan de mie (baked at High Street next door, of course, as were other tempting breads) and serving it in a nicely acidic tamarind broth. Pastry chef and Eater Young Guns 2014 class member Sam Kincaid helped the evening finish strong with summery desserts that were intricate yet came together on the palate—a study of corn that included whiskey sabayon, sweet corn ice cream, roasted blueberries, and locally grown popcorn, and a gorgeous little tart filled with berry jam and brown butter custard that sidled up to local plums and berry sorbet.\\nThis is indeed a restaurant restored. 306 Market Street, Philadelphia, 215-625-9425, website, Open for lunch Wednesday - Friday 11:30 a.m. - 2 p.m., Sunday brunch 11 a.m. - 3 p.m., dinner Monday - Thursday 5:30 - 10:30 p.m., Saturday 5 - 10:30 p.m., Sunday 5 - 9:30 p.m.Email Bill at bill@eater.com and follow him at @BillAddison.\\n \\nPhotography: [Bill Addison]\\n',\n",

At O Ya, what comes under that label is an expression of harmony, and one example of chef-owner Tim Cushman\\'s elegant redirection of Japanese cuisine. The idea for the creation began with a piece of nigiri sushi, the rice properly warm and threaded with vinegar. Cushman, a New England native, had Maine lobsters in his kitchen and wanted to use every part of them.

Flurries of yuzu zest and diced chives sharpened the pitch. The result was a thumb-size masterwork, luxury minus the pretension and tasting of cultures that entwined without conflict. It cost $27 for two pieces. I'd gladly pay it again.\",\n",

The place resides in a former firehouse in the city's leather district near the waterfront. The area is clogged with commuters during the evening rush hour and then quickly falls into an otherworldly silence. Cushman, who runs O Ya with his wife, Nancy, had never owned a restaurant before, though he had worked in food for three decades. He'd become a consultant specializing in stranger-in-a-strange-land restaurants: an Italian trattoria in Hong Kong, a deep-dish pizza parlor in France, a tapas bar in London.

He composes in bites, so his food is more in a form resembling virtuoso pop tunes (Brian Wilson, not Katy Perry) rather than lengthy symphonies. He sears hamachi, adding smokiness to sweetness, and then layers in acidic contrast with banana pepper mousse—odd-sounding but effective. Cucumber mignonette and tiny watermelon spheres gently buoy kumamoto oysters. Pork ribs are brined in tea, the tannins standing up to the meat. Olive oil bubbles, atop diver scallops in sage-scented tempura, fade like last night's dreams before your taste buds even register them.\",\n",

Yes, the latter puts the meal's starting point somewhere between San Francisco's Saison and Los Angeles's Urasawa. In this instance, I prefer rambling through Cushman's ninety-plus à la carte possibilities. Many of the best dishes are on both menus, and I was more drawn to select what felt most enticing in the moment.

Daikon dumplings acted as a bridge course between sushi and cooked items: The short-lived but influential raw foods restaurant Roxanne in Larkspur, California, inspired the dish. Cushman soaked the radish in a soy marinade to soften it, folded the slices around a miso-nut puree with mild kimchee and toasted garlic, and dressed the plate with nori sauce, ginger-scallion oil, and a variation on mayo made with pine nuts. Lots going on, yet it all clicked.

And the cooks often send out different dishes for each guest per course, rather than having the whole table receive the same rigatoni with Bolognese or guinea hen with chanterelles.\",\n",
       "  \"It's an approach that chef-owner Marc Vetri has been gradually working toward since he started the restaurant in 1998. He lived in Italy for a year and a half, moving from ristorante to ristorante and mastering recipes, before returning to his hometown to launch his ode to alta cucina. Vetri's wizardry with pastas in particular rewired notions in spaghetti-and-meatballs Philadelphia.

Onions, caramelized for half a day into a chocolaty jam, are encircled with a crepe, baked with parmesan, and lowered into a pool of white truffle fondue. Speckled brown butter coats chubby orbs of spinach gnocchi; it came paired with almond tortellini caught in a sweet-savory tug of war between crushed amaretti cookies and glossy white truffle sauce.

For the quail version, Leonti blanches and purees spinach and mixes it with salt and egg white until it becomes dough-like. He wraps it around the bird, which is stuffed with spinach and farro. The result is intensely saline, which Leonti ameliorates by dousing the quail with a fragrant syrup from Alto Adige made from pine cone buds. It smells like a freshly cut lawn on a fall day.\",\n",

A riff on the American idea of soup/salad/pasta comes in one bowl: A silky agnolotto filled with julienned zucchini ribbons in a moss green moat fashioned solely from pistachios, onions, water, and olive oil. He draws in Spanish influences for smoked-paprika chitarra that ensnares charred octopus and Marcona almonds in its tangles. Desserts included a flamboyant blueberry baked Alaska and a pert little cake that seeped pistachio cream.',\n",

The convivial, modern space includes a rear bar with sky-blue walls and the kind of light fixtures that, if you squint enough, bring to mind Champagne bubbles. When it launched, the menu leaned to the flavors of Italy, Spain, and Portugal.

Instead, a bowl of shucked Quebecoise oysters arrived in a bowl of oyster leaf and sea asparagus with a faint broth of whey and dulse. It tasted like undressed weeds. And a similarly unadorned plate of cucumber with fresh currants, lemon balm, and fennel felt oddly placed between the halibut and some beautifully cooked sweetbreads with chanterelles and turnips.

When it arrives, you get to play a little game called \"Name That Organ.\" Topped with shredded raw ginger and a lemon wedge (which you should squeeze on immediately), the bumpy brown morass certainly contains goat or lamb kidney, brain, heart, and testicles, which are, respectively, tart, squishy, muscular, and spongy. The surface of the kidney tidbits is shiny and nephritic. If you love offal, this dish is a joy; if you don\\'t, maybe not so much—though the flavor is mellower and less skanky than you might expect.',\n",
       "  \"Then there's badshahi haleem ($10), sometimes considered the national dish of Pakistan. It goes back to the Mughal Empire that once dominated this part of South Asia, when the food and the folkways of the region were heavily influenced by the Middle East. Named after a mosque in Lahore, once the largest in the world, this type of haleem consists of ground beef stewed with wheat and lentils for eight or more hours, resulting in a consistency like library paste—but what delicious paste it is, dotted with green chiles and caramelized onions! The thickness makes it perfect for scooping up with the restaurant's whole-wheat, tandoori-cooked rotis; white-flour, yeast-risen naans (both breads $1 apiece); or, best of all, the deep-fried, multilayered lachcha paratha ($3.50), which is one of Bundu Khan's specialties. The flaky flatbread almost falls apart and leaves your hands slippery with grease—but if you can maneuver it well enough to grab a fistful of haleem, the taste combination is fantastic.\",\n",
       "  'This being a self-described kebab house, there are kebabs you\\'ve probably never heard of. Tenderest is gola kebab ($10), associated in a menu side note with Karachi, Pakistan\\'s Burns Road, named after Dr. James Burns, an early 19th century British colonial physician. Gola means \"hand grenade,\" which this kebab resembles in shape, if not texture. In fact, finely minced with papaya, yogurt, and spices, the beef is so soft it must be laced together with thread like a girdle. The first thing you should do upon receiving it is carefully remove the thread, which can be quite annoying. Though the gola kebab won\\'t look like a grenade anymore after being unthreaded, it will still explode in your mouth with flavor.',\n",
       "  'My table liked nearly every kebab we tried, with the exception of the boti kebab. These lamb chunks marinated in yogurt and then grilled melt into mush in your mouth, proving that, where meat is concerned there can be such a thing as too tender. In chocolate such melting could be an advantage, but with lamb cubes you want something more sinewy.',\n",
       "  'Bundu Khan serves virtually nothing but meat—boiled, broiled, fried, or tandoori-roasted—and the South Asian immigrants who come here, the women dressed in sumptuous and colorful outfits, the men in plain sports clothes, are willing to wait outside for it and think nothing of foregoing vegetables entirely for one meal, at least. Chicken is a highlight, too. You can get it sauced in a Delhi-style qorma of medium spiciness; in a glorious, particolored biryani; ground-up in seekh, chapli, or reshmi kebabs; or in boneless or bone-in chicken tikka (order the bone-in for extra flavor). Best of all is chargha ($15) an entire bird laved in lemon juice and what the menu is pleased to call \"Oriental spices.\" The sheer size of the chicken suggests you may be eating the leftovers for days to come.',\n",
       "  \"Could a vegetarian get by at Bundu Khan? Barely. The tastiest vegetarian curry is chana masala ($7), perfectly cooked chickpeas immersed in dark gravy. Sometimes there's also palak paneer, the familiar casserole of spinach and fresh pressed cheese. But really, the restaurant is set up to encourage orgies of meat consumption, and that is exactly what you should expect.

       " [\"\\n  For the last few years New Yorkers have been obsessing on Isaan food from Thailand's impoverished northeast, an area dominated by the Mekong River and influenced by the neighboring cuisines of Laos and Cambodia. Its most prominent contribution to the Siamese menu are the shredded green-papaya salads called somtams, but there are also beef and pork jerkies, ground-meat salads, an appreciation of sticky rice, barbecued chickens, and stir-fries highlighting river catfish, duck, and pork.\\n  \",\n",
       "  'But gradually, the Isaan fare found in the East Village, Woodside, Elmhurst, and Red Hook is giving way to food from the three other culinary regions of the country: the Chinese-influenced, noodle-heavy north; the curry-heavy central region, anchored by Bangkok and also showcasing sour soups and basil-bearing stir fries; and the south – 14 provinces arranged along the Malay Peninsula, characterized by high country, jungle, and tourist beaches. There, the food can be even spicier than that of Isaan.',\n",
       "  'One of the first restaurants in New York to concentrate on southern Thai food is Kitchen 79, a new spot in Jackson Heights in the shadow of the 7 train, in a space that once held Arunee Thai.

Noticing the collection of unusual regional dishes on Kitchen 79\\'s menu, some rarely seen before in the city, the wiry and diminutive proprietor was asked where she came from in Thailand. \"I\\'m from Bangkok, but I can\\'t cook. I just eat. But I\\'ve got two chefs working for me in the kitchen, one from the northeast and one from the south.\"',\n",

Distributed throughout are nicely cleaned shrimp and little shreds of mackerel, which impart a powerful fishy flavor, while tart tamarind turns the broth brownish. The stew is also vegetable heavy, bobbing with pumpkins, bamboo shoots, and string beans. What are those striped globes that look like miniature watermelons? Thai eggplants. This strange and salty curry demands to be consumed with plenty of rice. One bite and you'll wrinkle up your nose; by the second you may or may not love it.\",\n",
       "  'Similarly spicy, but not so fishy, is kua kling, a dish that undermines our ideas of what constitutes a curry. The recipe is typical of the unusual dry curries of southern Thailand. Instead of being mixed with sweet coconut milk, the ground pork (or beef or chicken) is cooked in a curry paste with a small amount of water, along with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, until the meat turns damp but not soupy. The accompanying cucumbers and lettuce are used to scoop up bites, serving to partly staunch the burn. Though kua kling outwardly resembles an Isaan larb, the dish is much more variegated in its flavoring.',\n",
       "  'But not all the curries from this region are spicy. Showing the influence of Indian food on southern Thai, gaeng massaman (the second word is a corruption of \"Muslim\") is a mild curry of beef, potatoes, and peanuts principally flavored with onions and coconut milk. Mellowed with turmeric, yellow curry (gaing karee, $10 to $13 depending on principal ingredient) is also tender to the tongue, and unspeakably rich. Malaysian and Indonesian fare also inform the food of the southern region. Maybe you\\'ll be surprised to hear there\\'s a version of Malaysian roti canai called roti panang nuea ($7) featuring the same flaky pancake. But instead of the soupy chicken curry that usually comes alongside, there\\'s a more substantial serving of a coconut-thickened beef stew that will remind you of Indonesian rendang.',\n",

You've never eaten bigger or better curry puffs ($4) – three hefty crescents of puff pastry stuffed with poultry that may owe something to the early Dutch colonial presence in the region; then again they may be Spanish or even British in origin – they look like Cornish pasties. Part of the lure of Southeast Asian food is its wild mixture of influences, aboriginal, colonial, and modern international. Other delectable southern Siamese snacks include deep-fried shrimp cakes and chicken wings lacquered with turmeric and fish sauce.\",\n",
       "  \"What about the Isaan cook laboring side-by-side with the southern cook in the kitchen? He rocks the green peppercorns – which look like little trees – in several notable recipes, including a stew of wild boar called pad ped moo pha ($13), which might be one of New York's hottest dishes. It left one of my guests hiccupping after a few bites. Another northern dish worth ordering is ka prow ka moo, a thick slurry of pork knuckle, fiery fresh chiles, and basil in a thick sweet soy sauce. It's so rich with pork fat that even after blotting your lips afterwards you'll still feel like they've been injected with Botox.\",\n",

She studied at the famed La Varenne cooking school in France and then moved to Massachusetts, working for a Tunisian-born chef, Moncef Meddab, then running the kitchen at Casablanca restaurant in Harvard Square. In 1997, Sortun travelled to Turkey where she encountered pomegranate molasses, spice blends as brain-teasing as jigsaw puzzles, and airy pita pulled fresh from the oven. Four years later, she opened Oleana in Cambridge, celebrating these sun-dazed flavors and demonstrating how nimbly American ideas can meld with the ingredients of the \"Mediterranean\" (a Middle Eastern restaurant euphemism ripe for retirement).',\n",

But then she went on: \"The kitchen hollows it out and fills it with labneh flavored with za\\'atar and serves it with grilled pita spread with chopped morels and green garlic.\" Hmm. Stuffing burrata with yogurt strained to the thickness of cream cheese did sound tempting …',\n",
       "  \"It was, in fact, a dairy rendezvous—a meeting at the intersection of smooth and delicate. The yogurt gave the cheese shell a tangy new angle. The lemony za'atar merged with the mushrooms and garlic on the pita, intensifying each bite in the same way that herbes de Provence adds fragrant depth to ratatouille.\",\n",
       "  \"The lesson: If the choices at Oleana seem overwhelming, just look for yogurt and all will be right. Cacik, a classic Turkish dip, blends labneh with spinach, mint, cucumber, and garlic.

All the elements flirt with one another. In another special, a pebbly beach of quinoa salad with date puree disappears under a tide of carrot-saffron soup poured tableside.

Fittingly, a large bar with neon-green stools takes up nearly half the space. Ornate plates purchased in Istanbul line one turquoise wall, setting the scene stylishly against the dominant motif of exposed brick. The setting at bistro-like Oleana calms; the scene at Sarma rouses.\",\n",

The kitchen focuses even more squarely on small plates, broken up into categories like meze, shish (foods cooked on brochettes), savory pancakes and pies, and the namesake sarmas, or rolled and stuffed dishes. Young, engaged servers encourage diners to kick off the meal with riffs on bar snacks—perhaps dates stuffed with goat cheese and fried in sheer batter, or sesame-coated haloumi fries with white fig ketchup, the next generation's mozzarella sticks with marinara. Balls of labneh coated with za'atar harken to yesteryear's chevre balls rolled in herbs. Here, too, there are many dairy-sluiced seductions.\",\n",

He was circulating specials from a tray, dim sum-style. First up: hunks of boneless fried chicken, with sesame, nigella seeds, and green chile enlivening the rippling crust. Fried chicken is the universal language of food. Sure, why not?\",\n",

It's not as easygoing as an everyday beef burger and that's why The Breslin surely ranks with Ma Peche as New York's most envelope-pushing hotel restaurant; such establishments usually cater to a more conservative crowd.\",\n",

Instead of gussied-up pot pies for $36 we get stinky beef stilton pies for $9. And instead of a typical Caesar salad Bloomfield gives us an essay in fish oil, packing her croutons with more anchovy flavor than a jar full of anchovies. The lesson is this: Great chefs don't always ask diners what they want, they tell diners what they want, and if you disagree with that you can go to the local IHOP and build your own stack of pancakes.\",\n",

It boasts a level of fattiness that mandates a tannic California syrah ($16) as much as it does a Widow Jane Manhattan. Or perhaps more importantly, such bovine brilliance is yet another reminder to all the hedge funders and tourists tossing their money under the broilers at Del Frisco's, Wolfgang's, or STK that our city's best steaks are not to be found in steakhouses, but rather at restaurants with actual chefs.\",\n",

The mirror effect in a bowl of squid ink rigatoni was even more arresting: The black pasta was cut to match the shape of squid ringlets, and they had such a similar al dente texture that I had to concentrate on the flavor to distinguish them.

We sat in the center of the boardroom-gone-glamorous, watching the staff deliver entrees or desserts in synchronized sweeps to other tables, or dole out creamy slivers from the cheese cart.

Fresh and fried, almond-stuffed cherries buddied up nicely to a creamy round of foie gras torchon, encircled with duck rillettes and splashed with sherry vinaigrette for sweet-sour contrast. A roasted quail entree most embodied the restaurant's efforts to marry French and Italian cuisines. The plate held ponds of a Ligurian-inspired sauce that melded red wine, chicken livers, foie gras, spices, and yogurt.

Parisian gnocchi, the version made from pâté à choux and then browned, begged for richness in their leading roll. Instead they were relegated to supporting players—fancy croutons, essentially, among crisp radicchio, chanterelle mushrooms, dabs of chickpea puree, and cherries with pickled mustard seeds.

The blocks around it house tattoo parlors, consignment shops, hair extension pit stops, and stores like Atomic City Comics and Lady Love, a \"toy lounge.\" Among them the restaurant\\'s iron-hued exterior looks almost ominous, like it fronts a mafia-run nightclub or a local headquarters for the Legion of Doom.',\n",
       "  \"The area probably feels like home to Peter Serpico. He was David Chang's director of culinary operations and opening chef of Manhattan's Momofuku Ko before partnering last year with Philadelphia's omnipresent restaurateur Stephen Starr. And isn't this how Chang's empire started, in the East Village a decade ago surrounded by similar urbanity? It's apparent even from the outside, though, that Serpico is adapting to local culture: Valet attendants loiter outside the restaurant to park cars for $16.\",\n",
       "  'Walk through a glassed-in foyer to the black box theater of a dining room: painted brick around the ceiling gives way to slick dark walls full of dinner and drink lists written in precise handwriting. Lighting is last-moments-of-twilight dim. A narrow, oblong wooden table near the entrance comprises the bar—cool design idea. On the opposite end of the space gleams the kitchen, a miniature steel metropolis where the cooks stride around the ovens and diners settle in around the 18-seat counter. Serpico floats among his crew, his eyes mostly down and his mouth set in concentration.',\n",
       "  'Deep-fried duck leg',\n",
       "  \"There's no better way to describe the food than Changian—a balls-out collision of popular American, Asian, and modernist seasoned with New Nordic and Italian. Serpico helped perfect the style; he has every right to serve it. In the warm weather order two dishes straightaway: lobes of sashimi-grade scallops backstroking through buttermilk, scattered with poppy seeds, and dotted with chive oil, and a calming bowl of dashi decorated with trompe l'oeil, including gelatinized cubes of crème fraiche resembling tofu and pea pods filled with tiny cucumber orbs.\",\n",
       "  \"Then home in on dishes that embrace Philly and Pennsylvania tradition. Serpico takes the idea of Chang's now-ubiquitous pork belly buns and switches out the major players. He brines, sous-vides, and deep-fries duck legs and nestles the crackly morsels in hot dog-shaped potato rolls from Martin's Famous Pastry Shoppe, a beloved and longtime bread supplier out of Chambersburg, PA.

The pasta then gets dropped south of the border, landing in a saucy mélange of chorizo, sour cream, roasted onions, and hearts of palm chips marinated in lime. Fun, fun. But nothing beats a soul-revving bowl of filigreed crab dyed turmeric-yellow from pepperoncini, the pickled capsicums that adorn salads in Italian-American restaurants all over Philly. It adds the right vinegary smack to offset the crab, the caper-brined trout filets, and the smoked potato salad that lines the bottom of the bowl. (Lamb ribs soldered, via meat glue, to shoulder meat blazed with Sichuan chiles and soothed with charred eggplant and minted yogurt was a close second favorite.)\",\n",

       "  \"So where does Serpico fall right now in the must-try Philly lineup? For locals, it certainly delivers some brassy edge to the dining scene, and the chef-owner's kitchen chops are undeniable; it warrants an outing.

       " ['\\n  Driving the ten miles on Woodward Avenue from Detroit\\'s downtown toward Ferndale in the northern suburbs lays bare the city in all its disparities. The road leads past the glittery Fox Theatre (with its eight-story marquee flanked by winged lions), Comerica Park where the Tigers roam on their home turf, and the Detroit Institute of Arts that houses its collections in a palatial Italian Renaissance building. Along the street one also glimpses derelict blocks, empty apartment buildings, and poignant markers like \"St. Curvy,\" an abandoned turreted church nicknamed by long-ago parishioners for its winding balcony.\\n  ',\n",
       "  \"The ride can stir up a blur of emotions. But after dining at Ferndale's destination restaurant, it's easy to feel hopeful for what's next. Torino is an unlikely stage for some of the country's most promising culinary talent. It sits at the bottom of a condo building and opened as an espresso and cocktail bar in 2011. In January 2013 Torino owner Noah Dorfman was introduced to Garrett Lipar, a native of nearby Waterford Township and a young chef with serious wanderlust. Not yet 25 at the time, he'd already powered through positions at New York's Public, Chicago's Boka, and Frantzen in Stockholm, and staged at many other star-chasers, Alinea among them. Along the way, he'd been indoctrinated into the creeds of tasting menus and modernist techniques.\",\n",
       "  'Smoked Pike',\n",
       "  \"Lipar and Dorfman, energized by their mutual ambitions, decided to go all in. In May 2013 Lipar began serving prix-fixe meals, with the cooks working on an induction stovetop (no gas ranges allowed in the space) in a kitchen no bigger than a coat-check closet at a posh steakhouse. In the first months the menus were three courses for $34 or five for $52 and they changed weekly. New Nordic flavors—flowers and dill cream, a focus on seafood—came into play. Locally sourced ingredients met liquid nitrogen and Japanese smokers. Nothing outré for New York or San Francisco, but radical for Michigan. Diners came slowly at first, but then word started to circulate and the critics began praising. In March the Detroit Free Press named Torino its Restaurant of the Year. Last month Lipar was named to Eater's Young Guns Class of 2014.\",\n",
       "  \"Skeptical that this might be a case of overreaching greenhorns in a market hungry for some dazzle, I almost skipped Torino. I'm so glad I didn't. It was the most rewarding surprise of my travels thus far. Lipar has the gift for composing tasting menus, drawing on various genres as his own style emerges and evolves. In June, he decided to offer nine courses for $89 and change the menu once a month—a wise choice that allows the kitchen staff to fully master each course.\",\n",
       "  'Apricot with nasturtium',\n",
       "  'The first dish of the July lineup was a three-component bento box, each filled with summer squash: gently fermented slivers dotted with milkweed flowers; a battered squash blossom stuffed with pinto beans uplifted by summer truffles; and tiny zucchini, patty pan, and zephyr squashes grilled over a yakatori with sour beer foam spooned over them. Each element had the alchemical touch of a skilled chef: They tasted fresh and true to their essence but also amplified. The dishes grew incrementally more complex as the meal careened on. Apricot slowly simmered in whey turned savory, with verdant blasts from nasturtium flowers and young green grapes that resembled English peas. Asparagus arrived alongside a pool of savory chocolate sauce—a mole for vegetables. Fried eggplant stuffed with roasted heirloom tomatoes became a brilliant riff on moussaka, with warm gazpacho filling in for tomato sauce and honey aioli standing in for béchamel.',\n",
       "  'Suckling pig; strawberry and spruce dessert',\n",
       "  \"More protein-driven courses of smoked pike and suckling pig  gave way to the two most modernist creations. First, a sweet-savory palate refresher of shiso-green grape sorbet over compressed cucumber, briny from vinegar and simple syrup and decorated with vinegar gelee and Marcona almonds. It was all covered with yogurt snow, the tableau a reminder that Michigan's cold months are never too far away. Dessert was the evening's most esoteric effort—strawberries with angel food cake ice cream, house-made fromage blanc with macerated spruce buds, and other iterations of spruce and berry in the forms of powders, crisps, and caramels—but the components all merged in a way that satisfied rather than bewildered. As a finale, black garlic caramels and chocolates filled with aloe vera marmalade appeared with a sustaining cup of Sumatran coffee, a wink at Torino's origins.\",\n",
       "  \"Many liquid pleasures came before the java. Lipar has an advocate on the floor with beverage manager Ian Redmond. Starting off with a cocktail like Nigel's Magic Carpet (jasmine-infused gin, Luxardo Maraschino, crème de violet, sloe gin, and lemon) acclimated the palate for the journey ahead. And Redmond made choices for his $45 wine pairing that coaxed even more out of Lipar's cooking. A minerally Domaine Quénard white from France's Rhône-Alpes helped the stone fruit flavors resurface in the apricot. And he wittily chose a Greek Xinomavro with the tomato-eggplant dish to emphasize its moussaka-like characteristics.\",\n",

Customers scrunch in together at the counter or along an L-shaped, candy-apple-red banquette.

We downed eight oysters in quick succession before savoring the dense, sweet meat from Jonah crab claws. Kimchi, the condiment du jour, found its way into a freeform ceviche of hamachi slices over a slick of tomatillo salsa. The straightforward joys of frilly Maryland crab tossed in light Dijon dressing proved more gratifying.',\n",

Properly fried Ipswich clams—crisp-chewy, not too greasy, the oceanic equivalent of potato chips—are one of the great pleasures of New England, and Neptune did them justice. And the meal's surprise hit was the johnnycake, a dish that harkens back to European settlers. For its luxury makeover, it was capped with smoked salmon tartare and a thimbleful of California sturgeon caviar and then saturated with melted honey butter. It arrived as an appetizer but it made dessert redundant. And anyway, this isn't a place to linger over sweets. Someone is always anxious for your seat.\",\n",

The chef touches are subtle in the $29 lobster roll (which comes with fries, house-made pickles, and slaw). Bits of celery and mayo merely perfumed with lemon and garlic keep it homey, and the chives, besides adding their glittery green, infuse a delicate onion nip into each bite. The claw and tail meat tumbles out of a hot dog-style bun. The $30 lobster BLT, with the same accompaniments, could easily be lunch for two. It's a towering act of engineering, with two slices of ciabatta sandwiching a generous mound of lobster salad, which is partly held in place by a lettuce leaf acting as wrapper. Not wanting to concede to knife and fork, I had to attack the thing at angles with two hands. The ripe tomato was splayed at the sandwich's base, and with each bite its juices bled more into the bread, creating a pronounced acidic counterpoint. Ingenious.\"],\n",

A metal masher came on the side; the idea is to pound the stew meat into a rough puree with a texture akin to pulled pork, and then scoop it all out and spread it on hunks of flatbread with torshi (a garlicky pickle), yogurt, and scallion greens.

A caloric wonderland of a casserole, the Chesapeake region recipe typically includes lump crabmeat folded into mayonnaise and a cream sauce (or melted butter) with seasonings like dry mustard and Worcestershire sauce, sometimes sherry.

In Charm City it was Gjerde.\",\n",

I found a menu from my previous meal at Woodberry, during Christmas vacation in 2009, when it was easier to book a same-week reservation at a decent time.

From 2009, the list of dishes boasted global inspirations: fried rice with shitake mushrooms and egg, poutine, sizzling shrimp, pork loin with buckwheat crepes, roasted vegetables with polenta. In 2014, many more options directly reference Maryland heritage: oyster stew, chicken and biscuits, crab cakes with tartar sauce, rockfish in several preparations.

I'm not suggesting that creative minds tether themselves solely to community cookbooks and grandma's recipe box. I think, though, that the next step in the local-seasonal movement is for chefs not only to be champions of the land but also stewards of regional foodways.\",\n",

From their shells we scooped out several others that had been roasted and dressed with port cream and smoked ham, or with the house hot sauce, called Snake Oil, made from a local chile variety known as fish peppers. The peppers were once widely used by Maryland cooks but then nearly forgotten. Gjerde convinced some growers to plant heirloom varieties. Their impressive heat waded through Woodberry\\'s \"crab pot\"—a double entendre for the crock holding hot dip that also refers to the name of the traps used to catch crabs.

As if that quantity of food were not enough, ceviches come with a side of polished white rice or crunchy corn nuts, which may be dumped into the soup to vary the aquatic terrain. Who could go back to tiny swatches of seafood napped in a teaspoonful of fruit juice after tasting this?\",\n",

The front room flaunts an actual lunch counter which functions as a juice bar, and a red neon lobster burns in the front window – even though there's no lobster anywhere on the menu.

He was making us a welcome cocktail, a hot and cold iteration of the pisco sour. The first step for the drink: a sorbet made from pisco and lime syrup, frozen in seconds by a modernist cook's handiest chemical element, liquid nitrogen. The freezing mist rolled out of a canister, as thick as fog on a summer afternoon in San Francisco. For a moment the vapors completely engulfed Spero — we could only see his short-sleeved arm continuing to whip the mixture. The drink turned out smashingly—warmed egg white foam melted the sorbet to make it drinkable—and the bit of spectacle relaxed the crowd. The next few hours would be anything but stuffy.\",\n",

The two counters that comprise the dining area angle toward an open kitchen area; diners are also the studio audience. But it doesn't feel so much like The Chew as much as it does a culinary Cirque du Soleil blended with the heady themes of a Sondheim musical—pageantry, but also cooking as wry social commentary. You can spend the night absorbed in the tasks of the kitchen's many cooks, who are always twiddling with pans and tweezers and gizmos. A seductive waft of ham-scented broth may drift from stage right while you're absorbed in a plate of white gazpacho solidified into cubes that resemble tofu. And if you're so inclined, the meal can prod rumination: If familiar dishes are deconstructed and reassembled into something both recognizable and foreign, does it push the eater deeper into a comfort zone or alienate them altogether?\",\n",

Andrés helped usher D.C.\\'s dining scene into the new millennium with stellar small plates restaurants like Spanish-inspired Jaleo and Mediterranean-themed Zaytinya. The first six-seat incarnation of Minibar opened in 2003 in Andrés\\'s now-closed Cafe Atlantico. Conceits like lobster emulsion served in a plastic syringe and mango soup sprinkled with Pop Rocks stemmed from Andrés\\'s tutelage under El Bulli\\'s Ferran Adrià. The early experimentations paved the way for Andrés\\'s restaurant Bazaar, with locations in Los Angeles and Miami, and é by José Andrés, a six-seat tasting menu room that\\'s part of the Jaleo in Las Vegas\\'s Cosmopolitan hotel.',\n",

I gather from what I've read recently and over the years, though, that I caught the restaurant in its most masterful phase yet. Yes, there were plenty of trompe l'oeil small bites and lab-rat remakes of iconic foods from around the globe. But the progression of 25 or so dishes also had enough substance that I left sated, not merely amused or provoked.\",\n",

It started in the front-room lounge, with edible flowers pressed into oblate—transparent potato starch paper from Japan—and brushed with St. Germaine liqueur, rosewater, and fennel pollen. They came tucked inside a guidebook for wild flowers. Cute. Once inside, several tidbits arrived while we sipped our pisco sour: a savory twist on canelé pastries made with Parmesan, pineapple shortbread presented in a tin cookie box, a slice of \"pizza\" made with the oblate paper, and a frozen cup of blitzed Marcona almonds and cream containing whipped queso de Valdeón and passion fruit reduction. The \"dessert\" of this group: an apple-scented meringue in the shape of a rubber ducky filled with sultry foie gras ice cream. The chain of dishes even wrapped up with its own late-night snack, a riff on chicken shawarma swathed in oblate with crackly chicken skin, herbs like mint and cilantro, and a dollop of Greek yogurt alongside dusted with Aleppo pepper.',\n",

No tricks, just a handful of potent flavors. The technical alchemy showed up most overtly a couple of dishes later with pesto fusilli. The pasta was made from water and gellan gum: Cooks dipped cold corkscrews into the mixture, which formed hollow \"noodles\" that were injected with extra-pureed pesto. I don\\'t always go in for these shenanigans, but the faux-fusilli was satisfyingly al-dente and the pesto flavor more intense and direct than the traditional method.',\n",

And I was astonished in a different way by the next course: espardenyes, or sea cucumber—which I officially proclaim as the \"it\" echinoderm among the country\\'s fine dining chefs. I also ate the creature recently at Saison and Benu. Spero said the team that develops the Minibar recipes (which includes Andrés, Spero, and Ruben Garcia, director of research and development) was fascinated by the texture and decided to serve it, draped with bone marrow, well into the meal after trust had been established with the guests.

The evening whizzed by, and the meal\\'s breadth impressed: the zigzag between European, Asian, and American flavors, and the balance between modernist and straightforward preparations. Andrés was in town and stopped by to chat with guests before they departed. The night ended as it began—with edible flowers.

This is, after all, an extension of nearby Tartine Bakery, Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson's game-changer in the Mission neighborhood that bakes the country's most transcendent sourdough. Prueitt and Robertson opened Bar Tartine in 2005 and installed a 15,000-pound oven during a remodel in 2011, the same year that Balla came on board. This bread—tangy, smoky, crusty but with an interior like set pudding—ruined me for others when I lived briefly in San Francisco last decade. I want a hunk of it to be part of my last meal on earth.\",\n",

       "  \"Balla and Burns are DIY freaks. They've received ample attention for the ways they incorporate fermentation—a vital part of bread-baking and thus a natural extension of the bakery's essence—into the foods they serve, but almost every dish has an element they've also pickled, cured, inoculated, or dried. The lard I mentioned? They render it. The paprika? They make that from scratch as well. Their compositions look simple—and pretty, showered liberally with herbs and multihued sprouts—but quickly reveal beguiling depths.\",\n",
       "  'Rainbow trout brown rice; Beef tartare',\n",
       "  \"The bland-sounding trout and brown rice is actually an exploration of narezushi, a centuries-old Japanese method of preserving fish and cooked rice. Balla and Burns combine rice and trout with lacto-fermented brine left over from pickling. It was an experiment in which they found that the rice takes on the complex flavor of the brine and the fish absorbs some of the rice's nutty earthiness. They finish the dish by simmering the rice in dashi (the broth that includes fermented bonito, which of course they make themselves from fish that Balla's uncle sends from Florida) and scattering bite-size pieces of the trout on top. The textures are creamy and the tastes are clean yet mysterious.\",\n",
       "  \"Beef tartare is a signature dish, itself a meta-fermentation of techniques and cultural collusions. The bread, draped with silky wisps of lean eye of round, is baked with koji, fermented rice cultured with a fungus that's long been used as a base for soy sauce, miso, and other Japanese condiments. It lends a sweet, salty base note rich with umami—a Barry White rumble that evens out the tinnier tones of freshly shaved bottarga. For creaminess and further harmonics, the bread is slaked with a sauce of shio-koji (a salty version of koji, which I'm banking will be a hot ingredient nationwide in the next few years), pureed potatoes, butter, and beef fat. Presented on a wooden board, the tartare resembles Danish smorrebrod, but the Japanese overtones propel it into a unique dimension all its own.\",\n",

Know, without thinking too hard about them, that similar refinement and energy go into pleasures like langos—a puffy Hungarian potato bread spiked with sour cream, garlic, and dill—and smoked potatoes with black garlic and an aioli often sharpened with pickled ramps. Spinach, beet sauce, yogurt-like kefir, turmeric oil, and bright cilantro chutney bring substance and zing to the sprouted lentil croquettes. The dish hints at Middle Eastern flavors, the next region that Balla and Burns are gazing toward for inspiration.',\n",
       "  \"Bar Tartine's desserts—well, they sparked quite the conversation at my table of four. The kitchen avoids white sugar, finding it one-dimensional. I'm down with that, but I found the fermented notes in the creations like steamed black rice koji cake and a cheesecake made from astringent farmer's cheese a bit jolting. The friend at the table who tends to avoid dessert liked them the most. I prefer cakes and other treats that aren't too sweet but that have satisfying degrees of salt or tartness. In these the sour taste dominates. Something as straightforward as a bowl of ripe, glorious California fruit with homemade yogurt and honey would fall in line with the aesthetic.

The crustaceans collapse in the mouth with little more resistance than a communion wafer, spilling out their heady oceanic juices, while the bread soaks up any errant liquid, and the oniony ramps reset the palate for another bite.

Not a whole lot is bad here, just blah, and that brings us back to the discussion of obligation, because Gato isn't really the type of place I'd review if the chef weren't a national celebrity like Bobby Flay. Most of the food is about as affordable and forgettable as at many of the city's neighborhood joints that scratch by on good will, good service, a few solid dishes, and lots of walk-ins.\",\n",

He also opened Bolo in 1993, a three-star New York Times Spanish restaurant that partly informs some of the food at Gato. Flay still serves Bolo's seared duck liver in his new Noho digs, a dish that, when you get past all the nostalgia, ranges from overcooked to over-sinewy.\",\n",
       "  \"The Iberian food scene, alas, is different than it was in the 1990s, or even the early aughts, when Bolo was in its prime (it closed in 2007). We now have fine spots like Tertulia, taking its inspiration from Asturias, Aldea, representing for Portugal, Toro, doing the pan-Spanish thing with panache, and La Vara, tipping its hat to Andalusia and the country's historical Sephardic and Moorish populations.\",\n",

It's all average enough fare that ends up doing about as much for the Mediterranean as Tao does for Asia and Lavo, for Italy, which is to say not a lot. Call it a summer blockbuster of a restaurant, where safe flavors reign supreme. Flay's calamari with favas might as well be seitan with favas, and his garlic shrimp ($15) are perfect for those who prefer their crustaceans to taste as if they were genetically crossbred with styrofoam.\",\n",

Then I\\'ll try the crab risotto ($18), which is decent as a crab dish, less so as a risotto — the arborio grains are overcooked. Also overcooked is the octopus, whose wilted exterior shows little sign of having been crisped on the griddle. The insipid tentacle is edible enough as long as you stay away from the tangerine sauce, which is about as tasty as a frozen can of orange juice concentrate.',\n",
       "  \"That brings us to perhaps the biggest flaw in Flay's food: his propensity for sugar, and not in a smart agrodolce way. He tops his chorizo with apricot mostarda — which in the right hands can balance the fruit's sweetness with a sinus-clearing sting but here is all candy. His blue cheese-topped strip steak, boasting gorgeous char on four sides, is slathered in a honey-spiked red wine sauce that would be better suited for pancakes. Even the tarte tartin, with all its complex caramelization, makes the throat well up from sugar shock just like a Cinnabon.\",\n",
       "  \"It all makes me wonder whether Flay is sometimes catering to an Applebee's or TGI Friday's crowd, where guests with a high tolerance for sweetness expect bland meats to get their kick from the likes of Jack Daniel's glazes and such. Then again, there's no accounting for Gato's cumin-scented pork porterhouse, whose flesh contained about as much swine flavor as a can of supermarket tuna. And the tarragon chicken, with little trace of fat, tasted like what happens if you cooked the bird by leaving it out in the sun for a few days.\",\n",

The squid ink pasta is decent too, not for the heavy handed squid ink, the limp \"fettucine\" [sic], or the guacamole-like green sauce, but rather for the two giant carabinero shrimp. They alone would justify the $34 price tag.',\n",

She was raised in New Haven and now lives in nearby Wallingford with her husband and three children. We delivered them eight boxes worth of leftovers. \"Look, kids—apizzas!\" said MaryLee, pronouncing the last word as locals do: ah-beetz. The trio swarmed the dining table and started flipping open the cardboard tops.

I'll skip the origins and lexicons, then, and simply recap my experiences through the five area pizzerias with the largest reputations.

I ate no bad pizza that day, though my favorites were easy enough to rank.\",\n",

We arrived shortly after it opened at 11 a.m. The booths in the first of two dining rooms were nearly filled but the place was surprisingly calm. A gaggle of blonde, teenaged-looking servers congregated near the window in the back from which the pizzas emerged. They took turns circulating through the dining room. Their youth would eventually stand out against the seasoned, sometimes grizzled, servers we encountered throughout the day. Between Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, New Haven's longstanding pizza honchos, this one is by far the most easygoing.\",\n",

The lip is puffier than the others I tried, the crust chewier around the edge. We went for the restaurant\\'s famous Italian Bomb, loaded down with crisp curls of bacon, pepperoni, sausage, onion, mushrooms, garlic, and strips of red and green peppers—with just enough \"mootz,\" the native verbiage for mozzarella. We ate quickly, before its center sagged too heavily from the weight of all those ingredients. A clam pie tasted bland, leached of the usual brininess.

Now I switched to Foxon Park's Gassosa, a lemon-lime sparkler much friendlier to food. We ordered the house salad in a feeble stab at healthiness.

       "  'The first of 19 courses at his restaurant, Benu, was designed to settle diners into the meal. A quail egg, moored by a dollop of preserved ginger, had been lightly smoked in tea and brown sugar and set in a moat of smooth cabbage and onion soup scented with bacon. Rousong—pork braised and then dried, also known aptly as \"meat floss\"—was scattered over the egg to give the dish a bit of chew. Bright, rich, soothing, varied: This warm-up nudged the taste buds to attention.',\n",
       "  \"Then the true kindling of the senses began. An ornate black vessel arrived containing one elaborate bite. It resembled siu mai, the open-faced dim sum dumpling usually filled with pork and shrimp. This version was stuffed with pork belly, diced kimchi, and a tiny oyster on top. The wrapper looked cast in amber—a technique from the modernist playbook in which kimchi broth was set with hydrocolloids to give it body and then dried until pliant. By the time it reached the table it was akin to edible glass. In one bite the wrapper crackled into tingly shards before dissolving, leaving the soft burn of kimchi and the proteins' crisscross of earth-sea flavors. My tablemate and I looked at each other wide-eyed and laughed. What would be next?\",\n",
       "  \"Many, many pleasures, from a mind that stands alone among the country's vanguard of fine dining. Lee—36 years-old, born in Korea, raised in New Jersey—felt the call of refined cooking early. He worked in Pied à Terre and La Tante Claire in London before he was 21, moved to New York for stints in the kitchens of Daniel and Lespinasse, and then spent nine years with Thomas Keller. He was the chef de cuisine at The French Laundry before he opened Benu. What Lee gleaned from Keller was a confidence in his upbringing as a culinary bedrock. Keller famously took Americanisms like mac and cheese or peas and carrots and reconstructed them using Escoffier's techniques and California's bounty. Lee has fashioned a coexistence cuisine that honors both his Asian and American selves. It takes mettle. Upscale renderings of sea cucumber and salt-and-pepper squid don't pack the reservation books quite like pasta snowed under with shaved truffles does.\",\n",
       "  'Not that Benu is empty. A mix of casually dressed tech types and suited Asian businesspeople kept the restaurant humming and the people-watching prime on the night I dined there. But it is easier to snag a table here than, say, Saison, or certainly The French Laundry.',\n",
       "  \"Beggar's purse; Oyster, pork, and kimchi dumpling\",\n",
       "  \"And yet, for seasoned diners, I'd currently recommend Benu for a splurge over all the other blowout restaurants in the Bay Area. The cost is on par, perhaps slightly more reasonable by comparison, with other high-rollers: Tasting menus, the only option, are $195 per person. (The French Laundry starts at $295, though that price includes service.) More importantly, the food at Benu bridges East and West like nothing I've ever tried before. Unlike his peers, who often look first to Japan among the Asian nations for inspiration, Lee looks primarily to his native Korea and to China. His rigorous, brainy cooking has become more grounded in those countries since Benu opened in 2010. Then, he may have slipped sweetbreads or risotto into the sequence. Those types of dishes are less frequent now, which makes meals even more of a mind-opening delight.\",\n",
       "  \"Much of what sets the restaurant apart is the Asian emphasis on texture. Of course all chefs think about textural contrast—the handful of breadcrumbs over spaghetti, a sprinkling of candied walnuts in the salad. But in Lee's kitchen the tactile sensation moves to the forefront. Take a chicken-based soup that appeared halfway through the meal. The star ingredient was wild bamboo fungus, which in its natural state resembles white asparagus stalks and has a consistency that brings to mind tripe and honeycomb. It hit the palate slippery but then snapped between the teeth. The effect fascinated and its umami earthiness gratified.\",\n",
       "  \"Ditto Lee's take on shark's fin soup. The prized part of the swimmer was always more about its feathery elasticity than its flavor. Mindful of the way shark species are endangered by brutal fishing practices, Lee employs more modernist lab work to approximate the fin, which he serves in a bowl with Dungeness crab, custard infused with Chinese ham, and a broth perfumed with truffles and ginger.\",\n",
       "  'XO Sausage with basil curd; Salt-and-pepper-squid',\n",
       "  'I loved the studied way our meal unfolded. The soup and the engineered dumpling introduced us to Lee\\'s mindset, and then a progression of finger foods followed: Eel in crisp feuille de brick pastry, a riff on spring rolls, with a blob of crème fraiche for swiping. An angular sliver of celery capped with caramelized anchovy and peanut. A spoonful of silky tofu made with sunflower miso. A metal skewer impaled with sausage made from pork and dried scallops and shrimp, with a square of basil-infused bean curd. A luxe beggar\\'s purse of \"treasures from the oak,\" marrying acorn flour (a prominent ingredient in Korean cooking) and a filling of Iberico ham from pigs that were fed acorns and truffles that grow under oak trees. Genius! Then a play on salt-and-pepper squid—a crackery squid ink rice ship dotted with a gentle confit of squid, garlic puree, pickled chiles, and cilantro shoots. The progression was startling and fun—and with minimal exchanges of silverware, it made for a gracious balance between service interaction and our own engaged conversation.',\n",
       "  'Sea bream with aged tangerine peel',\n",
       "  \"The thrilling juxtapositions never let up. Soup dumplings awash in lobster coral were also laced with clarified butter, evoking the American penchant for lobster with drawn butter. Aged tangerine peel brought a citrus intensity to a tiny sea bream that enhanced without overwhelming. An optional sea cucumber course for a $25 surcharge brought texture to spare, stuffed with a shrimp mousse that emphasized the creature's spongy texture rather than masking it. Ballsy, and also rewarding. Hot mustard and fermented Chinese black olives gave roasted quail, the most Western-looking of the dishes, a distinct Asian pungency. Lee has access to sake lees (the byproduct of making the beverage) due to connections with sake producers in Sacramento, and he paired the fruity, cheese-like ingredient winningly with strawberry sorbet. The finale brought a pale orb of fresh and dried tofu skin—imagine the al dente bite of a fruit rollup but milkier—filled with almond and white chocolate. Glorious textures right to the sweet conclusion.\",\n",
       "  \"Four years into Benu, Lee is now tackling other projects. In the next month he'll open Monsieur Benjamin, a return to Lee's roots with casual French cooking. And though he doesn't yet have a location, Lee plans to next launch a Korean barbecue restaurant. Jason Berthold, who has cooked at The French Laundry and Per Se among others, will be chef de cuisine at Monsieur Benjamin, and Brandon Rodgers, also a Laundry alum, watches over Benu's stoves as chef de cuisine. They help free up Lee to work on his new ventures, but I hope he doesn't stray far. The energy he puts into his flagship now makes Benu one of the country's most extraordinary—and enlightening—dining destinations.\"],\n",

That comes through not just in her most overt dishes, including the famous fried pig's ear with its lash of mustardy lemon-caper dressing. The first dish of our meal was a pureed asparagus soup cloudy with crème fraiche, resembling a picture of earth from space, only green under the swirling wisps. The seasonings were so amped, with the vegetable's taste both heightened and diffused, that each spoonful left us marveling and wanting more. The same right-to-the-edge approach made a modest bowl of champ—an Irish staple of mashed potatoes and scallions, here subbed with ramps and fluffy from butter and milk—one of the evening's most soulful bites.\",\n",

Yes, yes, particularly welcome with its juicy grapefruit segments and a cumin-forward dressing that lifted the ingredients into Moroccan realms. And another special, a subtle braised rabbit leg, emerged as the night's sleeper hit buoyed by a verdant supporting cast of fava beans and fiddlehead ferns. I ordered the burger more for context—the patty that launched a thousand imitators and derivations—but, even in our ground-beef-saturated land, the mix of short rib, sirloin, and brisket topped with strong Roquefort stays mighty in the memory.\",\n",

My chums wanted wine; a ready-to-quaff Brezza Barolo held its own with the food.

They\\'re actively looking for another space in New York (with some recent hitches) beyond the four Manhattan restaurants they already run, and there were brief rumors about the duo opening their first venture in Los Angeles. Their western expansion already began early last year when the two took over Tosca Cafe, an almost 95-year-old bar in San Francisco\\'s North Beach neighborhood. The smoke-stained joint hadn\\'t served food since the 1950s, and its signature drink, popular during Prohibition, was the coffee-less \"house cappuccino\"—Ghirardelli chocolate and steamed milk with a shot of brandy. Bloomfield and Friedman shelled out $1.5 million to build out a kitchen, restore the old-timey murals, and replace red vinyl booths and stools with crimson leather.',\n",

(Jostled schedules compelled me there that evening; I\\'ve otherwise learned my lesson.) Four of us wedged into the slinky, 45-seat bar before dinner. The new team reinvented the \"house cappuccino,\" now a concoction with Armagnac (a hot ingredient in cocktails this year, I\\'m noticing), bourbon, ganache made from local small-batch producers Dandelion Chocolate, and organic milk.

But the first plate to hit our table, cubes of gelatinous oxtail terrine topped with a handful of parsley salad, was pure Bloomfield food: unctuous, saline, acidic, balanced, potent. Sliced red chilies and a flurry of pecorino took the tired Caesar in feisty new directions. The kitchen also gave grilled polenta a fresh look, searing firm chunks until the edges were dark and smoky and tossing them among meaty mushrooms, blobs of mascarpone, and grated Parmesan.\",\n",

We didn't order the much-discussed roast chicken for two, nestled on toast smeared with ricotta (it takes an hour to prepare); we finished the meal instead by gnawing down herb-speckled lamb ribs and then sharing a square of tiramisu lightened by a finishing douse of grated orange zest.\",\n",

       "  \"Zuni Cafe is the nation's neighborhood restaurant. Rodgers built it into a guidepost of physical and culinary comfort. The two-story room—with its mix of woods and metals, a dapper zinc bar, and tasteful watercolors (Rodgers studied art history at Stanford)—feels instantly familiar because it's so often imitated. But there's no replicating the sense of place. Triangular glass walls enclose the building: It makes an ideal haven from which to watch the ever-shifting moods of the San Francisco weather.\",\n",
       "  \"Zuni Cafe is the nation's neighborhood restaurant.\",\n",
       "  \"Zuni began in 1979 serving Southwestern cuisine, the thematic extension of a store next door that sold cactuses. The restaurant eventually absorbed the plant store. In 1987, after chef Kathy Riley left to have a baby, the owners convinced Rodgers, who was then cooking in Manhattan, to take over the kitchen. By kismet, Rodgers had been placed with the famed Troisgros restaurant family in France as a high school exchange student; it sparked her curiosity for French and then Italian cooking. She came to care more about the foods that people consume daily than the twinkling pinnacles of the Michelin three-stars. Her specialties reflected it. She realized the potential of the restaurant's Caesar salad, and she roasted chicken in the brick oven that the owners installed soon after she came on board: It became her defining dish. She was among the first to go gourmet with the humble burger, grinding the meat in-house and sandwiching the patty on grilled rosemary focaccia with just-garlicky-enough aioli.\",\n",
       "  \"A meal at Zuni feels like a homecoming, even if it's your first time. I'm relieved to say that hasn't changed. Gilbert Pilgram, who came aboard in 2006 after cooking for many years at Chez Panisse, shares Rodgers's aesthetic and is keeping her vision alive. The eclectic crowds haven't thinned. The menu still combines universal solace with California spunk.\",\n",
       "  \"The Caesar is as consummate as ever. I've made the recipe from Rodgers' invaluable cookbook, but it always tastes better in the restaurant—the ingredients are finer, the hands that unite them more practiced. Same with the roast chicken, a blur of herbs, salt, and campfire scents against the bird's primal succulence. The warm bread salad underneath—zinged with currents and pine nuts and scallions—slurps up the chicken's juices like turkey stuffing. Thanksgiving every day.\",\n",
       "  'Burrata and smashed English peas on toast; Roasted sardine salad',\n",
       "  \"It takes an hour to roast the chicken. My friend and I ordered a few other dishes while we waited. Burrata over smashed English peas on toast with mint and black pepper. A straightforward, feel-good spinach soup with crème fraîche and tarragon. A second salad, this one a tableau of roasted sardines, kumquats, cactus paddles (a nod to the restaurant's past?), and little gem lettuces in a fragrant cumin vinaigrette. We opt for a low-key finale: huckleberry granita served in a glass and strewn with torn grapefruit segments. After listening to a pianist riff on jazz tunes and waiting while a soft rain turns to mist, we leave calmer and lighter than when we arrived. Which, I think, is exactly the effect Rodgers hoped to have on those she fed.\",\n",

       "  'I was living in San Francisco when Nopa (\"North of the Panhandle,\" a hip area that\\'s part of the Western Addition neighborhood) opened in 2006, and the town\\'s food community quickly recognized it as the Zuni Cafe of its generation. California-Mediterranean flavors, often mingled in a wood-fired oven, dominate; the food and the beverage program venerate small producers; and much of the cooking revels in seasonal simplicity.',\n",
       "  'But perhaps more importantly, the restaurant fills diverse needs in the same way Zuni does. It\\'s a place to celebrate with blowout Burgundies and a spread of entrees, or to swing by the long bar for an after-work cocktail and burger. It has a kindred spirit of hospitality. \"Zuni was not just a physical predecessor to Nopa, it was the emotional and philosophical foundation of our restaurant,\" wrote wrote former Nopa manager Stephen Satterfield on the restaurant\\'s blog shortly after Rodgers\\' passing.',\n",
       "  \"Still, they are their own creatures. If the two share a spiritual sisterhood, Zuni is more Venus Williams, personality-wise, and Nopa favors Serena—feistier, more raucous. Nopa's soaring, bustling dining room resides in a former bank. (The cave-like vault, still in tact, keeps wines at an even 56 degrees.) And chef Laurence Jossel, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Allyson, and Jeff Hanak, tends to wield more acid and richness in his cooking. Avocado toast, for instance, may zap the taste buds with threads of pickled jalapeño; strips of mezzo secco (aged Dry Jack cheese) atop the toast's tuft of salad greens ease the heat. Sardines draped over asparagus ribbons pal around with the equally loud flavors of preserved lemon and olive tapenade.\",\n",

Warming succor comes in the form of macaroni and cheese, the blanket of dairy offset by spicy pickles, or a poached duck egg, its yolk saucing farro, trumpet mushrooms, and shreds of braised duck leg. For meat-and-potato types, there's a massive grilled pork chop that retains its lushness better than most. Contemplative food lovers will appreciate dishes like seared rabbit loin matched with quinoa, roasted whole carrots, thinly quartered black radish, and blueberries—it comes with the ingredients jumbled together so they all bleed into one amazingly cohesive whole.

In 2011 he opened Yardbird,  an instant South Beach smash whose fried chicken, meatloaf, and red  velvet cake reminded locals and visitors that, yes, Florida is part of  the South. He followed suit with Swine Southern Table & Bar in Coral Gables last year.  But in between, Kunkel built this paean to the three years he spent  rambling around the Asian tropics in his twenties. Local critics raved:  Khong River received a rare four-star review from Miami Herald critic Victoria Pesce Elliott. The hottest restaurant on South Beach doesn't serve ceviche and  caipirinhas but rather green papaya salad, drunken rice noodles, and  fish roasted in banana leaves. Khong River House, steps away from  tourist-clogged Lincoln Road and takes a heady detour into the flavors  of Thailand, Laos, and Burma.

       "  'To create the interior, at once transporting and thoroughly American,  Kunkel rearranged scores of everyday Thai objects into a chic, moody  saloon. Collages of woods in every shade cover the walls: They came from  crates and pallets shipped from Thailand. Corrugated metal sheets line  the ceiling, a nod to Thai shanties. Sturdy, surprisingly comfortable  chairs were fashioned from beached riverboats. Traditional bamboo fish  traps dangle over the bar, doubling as light fixtures. Thai motorcycle  license plates line the stairway leading to a private dining room.',\n",

Thai cuisine  aficionados won't find quite the fierce street-food cooking channeled at  national standard-bearers like Portland's Pok Pok and Los Angeles's  Night + Market. Thai cooks in the kitchen stay a true course, though,  cranking out a deft mix of funkier delights but also offering the  soothing curries so familiar at Americanized Thai restaurants.\",\n",
       "  \"Kunkel had a nasty spat with Khong River's opening executive chef, Piyarat Potha Arreeratn (known as Chef Bee), who is opening his own restaurant, Naiyara,  later this year. That said, the dishes I tried recently at Khong River  were punchy and prepared with skill. Beef jerky, an Isaan (North Thai)  staple, acclimated the palate with its pungent fish-sauce twang and a  dipping sauce that warmed, rather than incinerated, the taste buds. It  came with a cooling clump of sticky rice. The dressing for a green  papaya salad didn't shy from the classic, sharp zigzags of tamarind,  lime juice, garlic, palm sugar, and a whiff of dried shrimp. I loved the  hit of dill in the snapper wrapped in banana leaf: The herb is used  more in Laotian cooking than Thai. Among the tangles of noodles,  adventure seekers should dive into the brothy boat noodles (beef blood  is among the ingredients); the crowd pleaser is the soy-slicked,  basil-flecked drunken rice noodles.\",\n",

Its fine calibration inspired me to sip through a gin flight from Holland (the favorite: Nolet's.) At the dinner's end, imbibe appropriately with a shot of Mekhong, the Thai herb-infused spirit made from sugar cane and rice that recalls both rum and sake but is a singular product of its place.\"],\n",
       " ['\\n  If you frequent restaurants that require those increasingly rare commodities known as \"reservations,\" it\\'s likely you\\'ve mastered an urban skill as difficult and in demand as computer coding. That skill is punctuality. Arriving on time in New York, after all, isn\\'t so much a passive courtesy as it is a stressful, chess-like effort in self-mobility. \\n  ',\n",
       "  \"And because dinner often begins simultaneously for everyone at chef's table restaurants like Brooklyn Fare or Blanca, I like to think of being on time as an act of personal sacrifice for the collective good. Not that anyone's waiting; show up late and the meal will (justifiably) have started without you. The key, however, is that the enforcement of punctuality shouldn't come at the expense of making people happy. This is the hospitality industry, after all. And that brings us to the case of Nakazawa, an excellent sushi spot that might have fallen on the wrong side of that equation, at least on a recent visit when I was running behind. \",\n",
       "  \"Custom dictates that guests arrive at any given restaurant within 15 minutes of a reservation; yet within those first 15 minutes, Nakazawa staffers (and the chef) asked my dining companion about my whereabouts three times. Only after a second location-based query was she offered what most level-headed waiters offer guests when they arrive: a beverage that isn't water. I apologize for my tardiness — due to a duo of broken Citi Bike docks — but really, a restaurant's job is to make a guest feel comfortable — never the opposite.\",\n",
       "  \"Some might say I'm nitpicking. I'll counter that when you're spending $500 for two and vying for a reservation a month in advance, you want to feel coddled, not stigmatized, and the more you spend, the more such flaws are magnified. And for what it's worth, I arrived at Nakazawa 16 minutes past the reservation time. Yes, these ignominies were forgotten after we reckoned with raw scallops, as sweet and ethereal as French Îles flottantes. The mollusks were spiked with an aromatic yuzu-chili paste and served over a mound of rice so light it seemed not to exist. Perfect. \",\n",
       "  \"Then we experienced sake service that ranged from excellent to craptacular. So that's the bad news: Hospitality problems can persist throughout a meal at Nakazawa. The good news is there are few flaws in the fish. Nakazawa is already one of New York's better and more fairly priced sushi spots — no small achievement for a venue that's less than a year old. \",\n",
       "  'You probably know the story. Alessandro Borgognone, the co-owner, is a 33-year-old Staten Islander who used to cook at Patricia\\'s, his family\\'s restaurant in the Bronx. He discovered the 36 year-old Daisuke Nakazawa while watching him in \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" a documentary detailing the painstaking work that goes on behind the scenes at three Michelin-starred Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo. Borgognone lured the chef from a posting in Seattle and in August the duo opened Nakazawa in Manhattan\\'s West Village. ',\n",
       "  \"It instantly became one of New York's most difficult reservations. \",\n",
       "  \"Like at Jiro, Nakazawa serves a single product: Sushi. But unlike Jiro, where dinner is ¥30,000 (~$293 USD), things are a heck of a lot cheaper in New York. The price is $120 if you're dining  at one of Nakazawa's 25 dining room seats, with 21 pieces of nigiri served in flights. Those who sit at the gorgeous marble bar will pay $150 for the same meal, with most of the nigiri served one at a time. \",\n",
       "  'What accounts for the $30 price difference? \"We\\'re definitely pricing on demand,\" Borgognone tells me. He correctly asserts that guests (myself included) are willing to pay a premium for the theater of watching Daisuke rip the head off a live spot prawn. \"Sayonara time,\" the chef quips, before personally serving you the glistening crustacean. You pick up it with your hands and eat it; be sure to savor the jelly-like texture as it slide down your throat; this is a maritime gummy worm. Lovely. ',\n",
       "  'Then a waiter tries to pour tap into your sparkling water. Not so lovely. ',\n",
       "  \"Of course, sitting at the bar is more than just theater. Sushi is best consumed seconds after it's prepared, with the barely cool (or room temperature) fish being gently heated by the warm, vinegared rice. Borgognone rightly (and politely) admonishes diners who snap iPhone pics of the prepared sushi; there's no photography ban here, he just wants you enjoy the golden eye snapper right after it's blowtorched, with the fishy oils still oozing out like a pat of melting butter on toast. \",\n",
       "  \"Timing is all the more important with Daisuke's toro hand rolls; eat them instantly and the nori collapses with less resistance than a good soufflé. And while the nori wrapped around sea urchin wasn't as crisp as it should have been, you don't mind the oversight much because the Santa Barbara uni had such a crystal clear musk of the sea I'm halfway convinced Daisuke has figured out how to dry-age the orange roe like steaks. \",\n",
       "  \"What makes Nakazawa a satisfyingly uniform experience is that the head chef personally serves everyone at the bar — a pleasure that's less common at, say, Ushiwakamaru, where a ninth string sushi chef making spider rolls for the dining room was charged with preparing my $150 omakase a few years back. And at a recent meal at Tanoshi, which didn't cost too much less than Nakazawa, the backup chef started serving me mid-meal using a separate, somewhat mushier stash of rice. That won't happen here. \",\n",
       "  \"There are also no choices at Nakazawa, and that's something to keep in mind. One of the great things about Manhattan's best sushi restaurants is that dinner is often a dialogue, an interaction between the chef, who asks for preferences, and the guest, who lets the kitchen do most of the driving while putting in a few humble requests. At Nakazawa, the meal is monologue. You sit down and the food starts coming, perhaps a slice of banded grouper or sea bream with kumquat zest.\",\n",
       "  \"This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I've long been a proponent of no-choice menus at Alinea or Atelier Crenn. The question you have to ask yourself, however, is whether you view Daisuke's take on sushi, which emphasizes the more neutral and subtle flavors of the sea, to be a compelling enough narrative to warrant such restrictions. I'd argue it's more exciting to develop a relationship with a good chef like Masato Shimizu of the Michelin-starred 15 East, who can push you outside of your comfort zone while indulging your preference for say, oily and more strongly-flavored silver fish. In other words, Nakazawa isn't necessarily a great choice for regulars looking for a more bespoke experience.\",\n",
       "  \"What also isn't great: When you pick up your first piece of sushi (cherry salmon, served too cold), you discover there's no finger cloth to wipe the remaining rice off your hands — a waiter corrects the oversight a minute or so later after you look around in confusion.\",\n",
       "  \"Sake sommeliers sometimes do their jobs; they explain that you're drinking a Junmai Kimoto with nice acid; it matches well with richer fish like the clean horse mackerel or the umami-rich saba. Sometimes the sommeliers don't do their jobs; they pour your pairing, utter an unfamiliar name and and walk away before you can even make eye contact or discuss whether it's to your liking. And for those who'd like to peruse the wine or sake offerings in advance, sorry, there's also no online list. \",\n",
       "  \"Borgognone mentioned during a phone interview that diners are free to order more food after the end of the set menu; that courtesy, common at other omakase sushi spots, was never extended to me during my visits at Nakazawa — perhaps it's incumbent upon the diners to ask for a second round, which can be a tough proposition when all of a sudden Daisuke drops your dessert sushi and takes a bow. \",\n",
       "  \"It's not what you'd expect from a four-star restaurant, which Nakazawa most definitely is not. Everyone is pleasant enough and and the food is great, but just as punctuality is slightly more complicated than showing up on time, hospitality is more than being nice. It's about the steps of service and getting them right. It's a skill. And here, that skill needs honing.\",\n",

       " ['\\n  First, a brief history of tapas bars in New York. In the late 1930s as the Spanish Civil War wound down, leftist refugees (paradoxically known as \"Republicans\") streamed into Greenwich Village, eager to tell their stories of Fascist persecution. Many started Spanish restaurants there and in surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to formal dining rooms, many of these places — including Rio Mar in MePa and El Quijote in the Chelsea Hotel — boasted dark, red-upholstered barrooms where the odor of garlic wafted through like an ocean breeze. While the dining rooms were busy peddling massive servings of paella to hungry, cash-strapped bohos, the bars served snacks to homesick Spaniards, including grilled sardines, flaming chorizos, and poached octopus washed down with wines, sherries, and sangria.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'Numbering perhaps two dozen, these combo restaurants and tapas bars dominated the city\\'s Iberian food scene for 60 years, until a startling event occurred. A decade ago Mario Batali launched Casa Mono (\"Monkey House\"), a newfangled type of tapas bar with no restaurant attached, serving regional Spanish small plates with Italian twists. The orange-clogged dude also took what had been a placid institution and added a new level of theatricality, allowing you to admire a cook flipping coxcombs on a broad griddle. And Casa Mono elevated the runny poached egg to a pinnacle it would never descend from.',\n",
       "  'Not long after Boqueria debuted, named after a Barcelona market. If Casa Mono was a carefully constructed one-act play, Boqueria was a three-ring circus. The minute you came in the door, there was a gal madly slicing things in the front window, and the entire place — which featured raised tables and felt like an airline departure lounge — was constantly abuzz. But though small plates of charcuterie, bread dips, and pan con tomate attracted the most attention, these places and the imitators that soon followed insisted on backsliding on the promise of a real tapas bar by offering full-blown entrees that competed with the small plates.',\n",
       "  \"These two establishments begat the modern New York tapas bar, where you were invited not only to graze but to sit down and eat a full meal. But with international attention currently swinging from Catalonia's Ferran Adria to the Basque country's Andoni Luis Aduriz, it was inevitable that some new restaurant would want to chuck the sit-down menu and take these institutions back to their roots in the famous pintxo bars of San Sebastian. That place is Donostia.\",\n",
       "  \"Located at the northeast corner of Tompkins Square Park, Donostia is the Basque-language name of the city and tourist mecca of San Sebastian. In case you didn't get the message, an antique map of the Basque territory is repeated three times on the wall. The bar is gray-splotched white marble. The lighting consists of tortured metal globes like an eagle's talon in the deep narrow barroom, and a nifty chandelier made of wine glasses in a semi-private room toward the back. A third room allows tapas eaters to survey the bare-bones food prep area. With the facade flung open in fine weather, the place takes full advantage of the park, and there's nothing quite like sitting at one of the raised tables in front drinking a glass of sweet sherry and nibbling a pintxo or two as the sun sinks behind the Temperance Arch.\",\n",
       "  \"The function of a real tapas bar? It's a place to have a drink or two in the evening and a handful of snacks selected for their sharp flavor and eye-appeal. The food represents a hunger-deterrer, not a meal. The same implied advice pertains to Donostia: Have a drink or two, but don't try to eat dinner, because if you do, you'll be disappointed. But as a place to snack and explore the alcoholic beverages of Spain, Donostia is unparalleled. The food menu sprawls across two folio pages in a whopping 17 categories, but is reducible to a small collection of dried, pickled, and canned ingredients repeated in several small-plate formats. Don't expect any of the current dining tropes of fresh, local, or sustainable to be observed. This contrariness alone makes Donostia worth visiting.\",\n",
       "  'When you first arrive, stick with Banderillas (\"flags,\" $2 to $4), delightful toothpick-borne combinations of one or two bites, and Montaditos ($2 to $6), open-faced sandwiches of three or four. In the former category be charmed by gilda: two green olives and two pickled peppers skewered with an anchovy – a pintxo that originated in San Sebastian in the 1940s named after a Rita Hayworth movie; and chorizo picante: a single slice of spicy sausage, a wedge of aged manchego, and a streamer of pimento. These banderillas look like miniature chivalric pennants carried into a battle of flavors. The montaditos are similarly compelling, edible bread-mounted sculptures on which you might find a dab of salt-cod puree, a tentacle of octopus, brine-pickled cherry tomatoes, blue-veined cabrales cheese, a baton of eerily white asparagus, or the best canned sardine you\\'ve ever tasted.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  \"You can also discover culinary nirvana in the Pates section, which means in one instance a glass crock of whipped artichoke dip flooded with olive oil and served with a small flock of toasts. Another high point are the weird-ass sandwiches made with a pair of tortilla wedges, one example with a filling of creamed leeks and spinach constituting the menu's biggest feed. You also can't go wrong with the charcuterie assortment called plato de carne y queso ($20). A friend who's spent time in San Sebastian noted that the tapas bars there whet your hunger with trays displaying snacks stacked on every available surface. While our own health department prohibits this sort of sumptuous display, the bar at Donostia features several selections on cake-display platters under glass. You could do worse than ignore the confusing bill of fare entirely and adopt a point-and-eat strategy.\",\n",
       "  'Ultimately, the menu at Donostia is more about the booze. That part of the menu is a didactic document with voluminous special sections for red and white wines, ciders, beers, sangrias, and sherries (wonderful fortified wines that run from bone-dry to raisin sweet). Sampling the full range of beverages at Donostia could take a lifetime. My advice: Get started!',\n",
       "  'To misquote an adage, \"Good things sometimes come in twos,\" and that is true of Basque tapas bars in the East Village. Not long after Donostia opened, an olive\\'s throw away on First Avenue a place called Huertas (\"Orchards\") appeared, also claiming to be a Basque tapas bar. The interior makes artful use of dark woods and antique mirrors using bare brick as a backdrop. Huertas attracted lots of attention by its method of addressing the visual display problem by creating something called \"passed tapas,\" whereby pintxos would be placed on trays and carried through the barroom ($2 to $4). These were available in addition to medium-size dishes called raciones, which could be ordered from the kitchen.',\n",
       "  \"Huertas has a beautiful gilda, too, with a little more emphasis on the anchovy, and individual mussels escabeche awash in white vinegar and chopped aromatics. The only dud here was the spongy hake croquette resting in a puddle of indifferent garlic mayo. There tend to be eight passed tapas listed on the chalkboards, and an additional 10 raciones, plus charcuterie and cheese, making the menu in the front room much easier to digest than Donostia's. As an added boon, some of the sea creatures featured are fresh and imported from Spain. Foremost in strangeness are percebes, gooseneck barnacles that look like a baby alien that has just gnawed its way through your stomach. The flesh squeezed from its neck is sweet, but the price of four or five small specimens priced at $13 is too steep. The best dish among the raciones is something called migas, featuring tidbits of duck and croutons tossed in a verdant green sauce, with fresh pea shoots on top.  Brilliant! Fresh is not a dirty word at Huertas, as it is at Donostia.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  \"The list of Spanish alcohol is much shorter at Huertas; nevertheless, there is good cider, sherry, and vermouth (the latter on tap), and the barman is well versed in the selections available. Then there's the back room, which is reserved for a single prix-fixe meal ($52) in the faddish modern style, which flies in the face of the tapas tradition, though it serves as a reminder you're in the East Village rather than San Sebastian — as if you'd forgotten.\",\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  \"Lucky for us, the four-course feed via chef Jonah Miller verges on the superb. It begins with radishes served with whipped parsley butter as a prelude, then progresses to the first course: three small pintxos, including, on this occasion, a gilda, a toast with an agreeable puddle of foie gras, and a single mussel escabeche served in a soup spoon. The second course is a variation on the duck and pea-shoot migas of the raciones menu. So far, the meal has been a triumph, but it threatens to run off the rails with the third and largest course, which is not quite big enough to qualify as an entrée. This is the first course offering a selection of three, and my dining companion and I enjoyed a sliced duck breast with greens and golden raisins in a broth that threatened to be sweet, but wasn't. Less satisfactory was a grease-sodden vegetarian rice dish featuring pickled mushrooms squiggled with mayo, presented in a miniature paellera, suggesting once again that tapas bars shouldn't meddle in main dishes. The final course was a return to fine form, with three choices, from which we picked a pair of small cakes draped with pickled rhubarb and a cheese plate offering three bang-up selections with membrillo and a dab of honey.\",\n",

We started by tackling the frutti di mare—one of those iced platters heaped with oysters, mussels, clams, beady-eyed prawns, and now-ubiquitous uni that evokes the kind of languid beachside vacation that few of us have time for. Trabocchi's showmanship can sometimes lead to excess: A soft-shell crab appetizer was breathtaking to behold but scattered to eat.

There was also a timely angle: In March, front-of-house manager Charles Masson Jr.—son of founder Charles Sr. and his widow Giselle, who still owns the restaurant—left the place in the wake of a family schism. He\\'s replaced by his younger brother, Philippe. Charles Jr. had presided over La Grenouille for much of four decades; his departure caused a titter among New York society types. (When I emailed the restaurant to ask if Philippe was thinking about making changes, this was the wisecrack response: \"He said he plans on putting in a pool hall and bordello.\") We three may have had no previous context with the restaurant, but we were still curious about the quality of its timeless (anachronistic?) cooking.',\n",

The shocker among the starters was Sutton\\'s assortment of cold salads: asparagus, cucumber, julienned celery, ratatouille, cherry tomatoes, shrimp in rémoulade, and cold-poached salmon with pesto. This could have been a throwaway dish, a concession to dieters, but each element on the plate had been prepared with thought and precision.

But the winner of the evening went to Sutton, who smartly opted for the pike quenelles.

       " [\"\\n  On July 17, 2012, Ivan Orkin, perhaps the only Long Islander to become famous for running a duo of Tokyo ramen joints, hosted a one night pop-up at Momofuku Noodle Bar in Manhattan's East Village. The doors unlocked at 5:30 p.m. and shortly after 6 p.m. I was told there would be no more Ivan-brand ramen left because half the city, apparently plagued by a mid-summer flu pandemic, thought it would be smart to order hot soup on a 91 degree day. Sure, the sell-out was part hype (and part damnation of strict seasonality), but it also showed that New Yorkers wanted better Japanese noodles — and more of them.\\n  \",\n",
       "  \"Now, two years later, the Big Apple is well into the throes of a ramen revolution and helping to lead the charge is Orkin himself, with a sit-down restaurant on the Lower East Side and a leaner pay-before-you-eat outpost on the Far West Side. And amid our glut of good gluten, you can pretty much walk into either without a wait, though we'll revisit that statement come December.\",\n",
       "  \"This is all good news because the full-service Ivan Ramen on Clinton Street, at just six weeks old, is already slinging out some of New York's most enjoyable noodles as well as a slew of righteous small plates. Case in point: Orkin lets diners wrap sheets of nori around morsels of slow cooked pork, roasted tomato, and sushi rice. Believe me when I say that if the $450 per person Masa ever wanted to drum up more business it could do so by putting these umami grenades on the menu. They cost $6 for two.\",\n",
       "  'But before we get too involved with all this deliciousness, it\\'s worth dwelling on the awesomely short queue a bit longer because really, waiting two hours for ramen makes about as much sense as booking a spot at your local slice joint a month out. Ramen, however underpriced it might be — a $15 entree whose complex components require a heck of a lot more effort to make than a $59 steak —  is still spur-of-the-moment \"I\\'m hungry\" food. And given the vast quantities of salt and fat you\\'re ingesting, sometimes a three-hour tasting menu\\'s worth of calories in a single bowl, perhaps it\\'s best not to think too much about it at all.',\n",
       "  \"Though it can be hard not to. Take Orkin's outstanding spicy ramen, a mix of dashi, chiles, and chicken broth, all studded with bits of pork and toothsome rye noodles. It sounds simple and the texture is rustic but it has the depth of flavor you'd expect from a fancy French sauce that some guy spent half his life learning to make. And then there's the heat, which lights your GI tract ablaze like a Roman candle going off in both directions. I dare you to eat it on a first date.\",\n",
       "  \"Or consider the triple-garlic mazemen, a style of whole wheat ramen where the ratio of broth-to-noodle is closer to Italian pasta than a can of Campbell's. Orkin roasts and distills his garlic to such a level of sweetness that Mark Ladner could sell this perfectly al dente dish at Del Posto for twice as much and no one would blink an eye. But since the world deems this delicious product to be cheap, Orkin charges just $15.\",\n",
       "  'No, none of this is terribly revolutionary, not here at least. While Orkin rose to fame in Tokyo by breaking the rules, he\\'s now competing in a city that excels in just that, where great traditional noodles co-exist with very good Americanized ramen. There\\'s Dassara in Brooklyn, which spins a gnarly \"deli ramen\" out of what\\'s essentially matzoh ball soup. There\\'s Ippudo in the East Village, which produces a tonkotsu so milky I\\'m certain each bowl results from putting an entire wild boar\\'s worth of fat through a commercial juice press. There\\'s Benkei on Delancey, where the chef won\\'t let you order his fine seafood ramen (or anything else) until well after midnight. And of course there\\'s Momofuku Noodle Bar, where David Chang sells a vegetarian chickpea creation that might just be the single most revolutionary ramen dish in New York right now.',\n",
       "  'So what makes Ivan Ramen vital in this competitive environment for starch and soup? Its ability to bridge the gap between the new and the old and deliver on both sides of that coin with solid service. Orkin can slay you with his shio (salt) or shoyu (soy sauce) ramen just as much as he can with that garlic mazemen, a flavor so distinctive it should be eligible for the same trademark protection as a Cronut.',\n",
       "  \"The best seats are at the counter, where you'll see the cooks working away. Look above them for a backlit comic strip, with a woman, a cowboy, and a happy monster all slurping up noodles. There's also an outdoor garden and it can fill up quickly — New Yorkers won't be denied their al fresco eats even if it means sweating into their soup.\",\n",
       "  'The ramen takes time to come out (as it should) so start with something cold and sour. Chinese broccoli with sweet soy pickled garlic will get the job done just fine, as will XO pickled daikon, with spaghetti-like strands of the radish coated in scallop chile oil and bits of dried shrimp. The flavor profile is fresh but it should also be salty and funky, which it is not, and that brings us to one of the quirks of Ivan Ramen: Orkin has an occasional tendency to dial down strong flavors.',\n",
       "  \"Thousand-year-old eggs, a Chinese dish where eggs are preserved in ash and lime for months, are traditionally valued for their pungent, sulphuric aromas. Here at Ivan, the delicacies are deviled and taste as neutral as that suburban American staple. Fried chicken livers and hearts are a fine study in crispy, snappy textures, but the meat is bland; there's no irony punch here. The milder approach works better for scrapple, a Pennsylvania Dutch breakfast meatloaf known for its restrained organ-meat overtones. Orkin nails that flavor profile dead-on, pressing pork shoulder, chicken liver, and buckwheat into a savory, offaly waffle, with bits of apple and maple mayo keep the richness in check.\",\n",
       "  \"Things get more turbo-charged with the ox tongue, whose assertive, rated-R beefiness needs the accompanying hot mustard and soft broth to keep things PG-13. Fried shrimp, often an ode in taste and texture to Amazon.com's packing materials, is 100 percent maritime bliss at Ivan Ramen, with the squirty heads still attached for sucking, and shrimp powder added on for oompf. And kudos to Orkin for amping up the oceanic aromas to 11 with his ankimo dirty rice, a gorgeous platform for the gentle sting of scallion and the high-tide tang of warm monkfish liver. It's a brilliant study in surf and earth.\",\n",
       "  'Now it\\'s time for the noodles. One of my well-fed dining companions, a musician who refers to himself as a \"ramen whore\" perhaps said it best: \"The shio and shoyu are classic and can be taken down in a heartbeat.\" I pass along that comment because you might see certain ramen experts with no concern for their blood pressure slurping down two bowls at once in 10 minutes flat (to enjoy the broth at its hottest and to avoid overcooking the noodles) — I\\'m more of a half-a-bowl in 20 minutes type of guy. If anything, I\\'ll argue the shio tastes better when cooler, as it allows the bonito it\\'s made with to shine through more clearly.',\n",
       "  \"Shoyu, in the earlier days, had the color of molasses and all the daydream-inducing complexity of the soy sauce it was made with. But Orkin now uses a lighter product with a shallower flavor. It's not bad, just not as good. Triple garlic, shio, and spicy chile ramen are the smartest moves here, while the four cheese mazemen is a fine Japanese carbonara of sorts, with nutty asiago and rich pork.\",\n",
       "  'Orkin tells me lunch will debut in July and that he eventually has plans to roll out some of the more expanded selections of noodles he offers in Tokyo — like a variety of tsukumen dipping ramen. There\\'s no dessert here — Orkin says he\\'s still \"tossing around\" that idea — and the lack of sweets of course helps him turn over tables more quickly. In the meantime, a friendly waiter recommends you saunter over to il Laboratorio del Gelato, where the wait, incidentally, might be longer than at Ivan Ramen; I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense in June to normal people, if not to food people.',\n",

Their mutual zeal for Italian cuisines led to running a place that initially only served during the day, the idea being that they could both concentrate on their art after the lunch rush.

A friend and I arrived around 6:10 on a recent Wednesday and hung out for only 10 minutes before a table was ready. We briefly ducked into the upstairs bar, snug and beckoning with its backlit shelves and marble tiles.

The story goes that Germon was talking with a fish supplier who'd recently come back from Italy and was raving about the grilled pizza he'd tried in Florence. It turned out that the guy was confusing a grill with a wood-burning oven, but the idea stayed with Germon. When he and Killeen experimented with dough cooked directly on the grilling grates, they were taken with the charred pockmarks left by the flames, and the texture that seesawed between crisp and chewy.\",\n",
       "  \"Al Forno's pizza deserves its pedestalled status. We chose one dotted with Tuscan kale pesto, which arrived in the shape of a flattened, stretched-out boomerang. Grill marks on the crackery crust were visible through a base of fontina and pecorino cheeses, topped with pools of tomato sauce, the roughly pureed pesto, and scallions strewn like confetti. If I lived in Providence I would eat it as often as possible, vacillating between this version, a simple margherita, and perhaps a variation zapped with chile oil.

       "  'The bar at Saison',\n",
       "  \"Despite the throwback music, Saison is the country's most modern iteration of an ultra-luxury restaurant. Executive chef and co-owner Joshua Skenes didn't spend years working his way through fine dining strongholds. The 34 year-old attended the French Culinary Institute in New York and then worked briefly for Jean-Georges Vongerichten and with chef Anthony Ambrose in Boston before moving to California in 2005.\",\n",
       "  \"Skenes and sommelier Mark Bright (both had been employed by chef-restaurateur Michael Mina) began Saison in 2009 as a Sunday-night-only pop-up in a former stable in the Mission neighborhood. At the time Skenes was also serving lunchtime sandwiches, soups, and salads from food cart he called Carte415. For Saison, Skenes and Bright started out offering a multi-course meal for $60, with $30 optional wine pairings. Even then there were glimmers of what Saison would become: Guests were greeted with a glass of bubbly. The kitchen was open and relaxed enough then that diners could occasionally mosey through. Stunningly prepared seafood and vegetables, still Skenes's primary palette, anchored the menus.\",\n",
       "  \"The restaurant's evolution—and its owners' ambitions—went into warp speed. When word spread, reservations were often booked two months in advance. Skenes and Bright began serving three, four, and then five nights a week; within a year they leased the space and the pop-up became permanent. A hearth and a Molteni stove (essentially a cooktop Lamborghini) were installed. Last year the restaurant moved to an elegant 1800s building that once housed the California Electric Light Company in SoMa, near AT&T Park. Its industrial starkness received some initial chilly reception, but a recent remodel that included hardwood flooring for the kitchen and carpeting in the dining area helped warm the space and boost its local star rating.\",\n",
       "  'At every step, Skenes\\'s cooking intensified, the ingredients grew more rarified, and the prices escalated to match. Last year the restaurant offered a fixed-price menu for $298 per person in the 18-seat dining room, with a truncated $88 tasting menu in the bar. At the moment there is no bar menu, and in the dining room guests select from a $248 base option or the $398 \"discovery menu.\" The optional wine pairing? Also $248, though the staff will also suggest several by-the-glass options to carry the meal. Of course there is also Bright\\'s wine list, so massive now at 3,300 bottles that there are separate tomes for whites and reds.',\n",
       "  \"I wanted to experience the full measure of the restaurant's powers, particularly to compare other tasting menus I tried on my trip to San Francisco, so I opted for the discovery prix fixe and the wine pairings.

After a tea of Meyer lemon and herbs, a hand towel, and a splash of Champagne, the first course arrived as an indulgent balm to banish the thoughts of money—a glass goblet filled with a liberal tablespoon of white sturgeon caviar. It came over cured, smoked sturgeon belly and a gelee made of the fish's grilled bones. The smoked and grilled elements perfumed each spoonful of caviar without overwhelming it, and the flavors summarized the primordial themes in Skene's cooking: ocean, fire, distillation.\",\n",
       "  \"Next came a riff on Provençal barigoule, artichoke with scallop in a gently astringent, palate-priming bouillon steeped from wild thistle. Then, a succession of one or two bite seafood dishes that danced the line between raw and cooked: a square of Japanese butterfish, one edge quickly pressed against coals; bonito basically waved over heat and served with a dot of black vinegar made from the fish's head; an angular piece of pickled horse mackerel on thin toast with crème fraiche. Two marvels followed: roasted abalone in a sauce of its liver and capers, topped with threads of laver seaweed, and then one perfect lobe of uni lolling over a piece of toast from unrivaled local bread company Tartine, the bottom soaked in vegetable juice.\",\n",

Like other brilliant, hell-bent American chefs of his generation, Skenes draws techniques from cooking traditions around the world and weaves them into a personal mosaic.

The fish sat in a shallow pool of yogurt sauce tinged with coconut oil.

Like many of the new Gujarati immigrants, the restaurant Chowpatty was vegetarian, and it catered to a religious group known as the Jains, whose concern for living things was so complete, they eschewed garlic and onions so as not to harm the insects that infested the underground bulbs of those plants.\",\n",

       "  \"A couple of weekends ago, during the annual James Beard Foundation Awards festivities, it seemed that every time I checked Twitter or Instagram a chef or food writer was posting about their meal at Estela. It was one of three New York hopefuls up for the year's Best New Restaurant prize (which ultimately went to Peche in New Orleans). Estela's Manhattan competition, glittery Betony in Midtown and red-sauce fantasy Carbone in Greenwich Village, both had much higher profiles. A 55-seat charmer housed in a former knitting factory on East Houston Street, Estela earned solid reviews after opening in June last year. Its renown kept building, though, on the strength of Uruguayan-born chef Ignacio Mattos's idiosyncratic cooking and the seductive beverage list assembled by co-owner Thomas Carter, previously the wine director of Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Visiting food pros were curious about the place. I know I was.\",\n",

       "  \"It's time for an enterprising chef or restaurateur to rise up and popularize the more pungent regional flavors of India. In the way that Pok Pok's Andy Ricker and others—like Kris Yenbamroong at his Night + Market restaurants in Los Angeles—are moving our notions of Thai food beyond pastel curries and spring rolls, we need some front-and-center restaurants that revel in Indian cooking's feral edges. We taste such an insignificant sliver of the subcontinent's vast cuisines in this country. Most menus cleave to the dairy-rich dishes refined by the Persian-influenced Mughal Empire, which ruled India from its northern roost for four centuries. It takes hunting, usually through an Indian neighborhood in a major city, to find the humble places that serve Kerala dried shrimp curry in coconut gravy, or fish cooked with heady mustard oil from Calcutta, or the Mumbai version of the street snack pani puri—fried shells filled with cubed potatoes and black chickpeas and doused with a green liquid hinting of sulfur from kala namak, or black salt.\",\n",
       "  \"While I wait for the revolution, I am glad for the few higher end restaurants that employ the tastes of India shrewdly, blending them with Western ingredients and techniques while keeping the motherland's essence intact. Lauded Washington D.C. restaurateur Ashok Bajaj runs three of them: The Bombay Club and two locations of Rasika. (He also operates five other restaurants that serve a gamut of cuisines, including Italian and Modern American.) The Bombay Club, situated a block from the White House, opened in 1988 and has long been a haven for the city's power players. It emulates the gentlemen's clubs of India's past. Rasika, which first launched in 2005, feels very much of its own era.\",\n",

A $600,000 remodel in 2009 ushered in a private dining space and swirly mauve carpet, just to freshen the restrained elegance. Tuxedoed service is unobtrusive: There are deferential nods and swift but efficient visits to the table. No one prattles about giving a \"tour\" of the menu. Someone plays a white baby grand near the entrance while slow ceiling fans stir the air overhead.',\n",
       "  'In other words, The Bombay Club is an Indian iteration of the Continental restaurants of yore, and after 25 years in business it retains a dressy, diverse clientele. A few menu items detour into modern conceits: One of the breads is stuffed with goat cheese, and kale, the green that conquered the nation, appears flash-fried as a snack lashed with chutneys and yogurt. But most are plucked straight from the Indian lexicon—cherry-picked dishes that represent either the gentlest creations from around the country, or highlighting those whose spices are easiest to dial back.',\n",

Pop, pop. They go down as easy as a handful of Chex Mix at a Christmas open house. Nilesh Singhvi—who previously oversaw the kitchens at the Taj Palace hotel in New Delhi—composes a delicate version of masala crab from the Southwestern coasts. It's barely scented with curry leaf and worlds tamer than the crab dishes that Marylanders prefer spiked by Old Bay seasoning. The lumpy morsels taste fresh and sweet, though. Shrimp lolling in coconut cream gravy dotted with mustard seeds is equally docile.\",\n",

The kitchen composes a striking thali on a silver platter, arrayed with lemon rice or another pilaf, a couple ruddy meat curries, dal, and a vegetable like the ubiquitous creamed spinach (saag).\",\n",
       "  'And for liquid dessert, four of us retreated to the lounge, where one of the suited hosts rolled out a cart to prepare cobra coffees made famous at the Bombay Brasserie in London, where Bajaj once worked. He peeled off a trailing curl of orange rind (the \"cobra\") and lit it on fire with flaming booze before mixing it with coffee and pouring the drink into glasses with caramel-coated rims. Pure Continental showmanship.',\n",

Rasikas' menus do tackle more cross-cultural riffs than their older sibling: chaat salads made with avocado, samosas stuffed with sweet potato, griddled eggplant slicked with olive oil (a burgeoning product in India, but still), fritters formed with, yes, kale. But their offerings are also broader, and many of the dishes, particularly entrees, similarly derive from among the swath of Indian cuisines. The main difference is that the food as Rasika is bolder, the flavors punchier and less rounded.\",\n",
       "  \"That holds true for the atmosphere as well. The scheme at the second Rasika in West End, which opened in 2012, is downright conceptual: Rectangular wood panels climb up a column into the shape of a modernist Bodhi tree, and a silvery hand reaches over a glass partition, sculpted into the shape of a Buddhist mudra. The Penn Quarter original looks sedate by comparison, though its ruby, gold, and burnt orange tones still feel like you're wrapped in an especially opulent sari.\",\n",

       "  \"I've visited both outposts in the last couple years and found them superb and on par with one another; the precision of the cooking at Penn Quarter slightly outpaces its younger brother. I lunched at the original recently, though I urge first timers to go for dinner, when the meal feels more like an occasion. (The menus are identical.) We started with uttapam, a pancake made from fermented rice and lentil batter, studded with seasonally appropriate white asparagus. The mustard seeds and curry leaves seasoned overtly, and the dollop of coconut chutney on top took the dish home to South India. Crab revved with plenty of ginger and garlic came stacked with peppered phyllo dough that visually imitated poori, the breads that balloon while frying. A swift char on shrimp glossed with mango created a smoky sweetness. Mixed grill—salmon roasted in the tandoor oven, chicken scented with green cardamom, a smooth-textured lamb kebab sprightly with garam marsala—proved a satisfying mélange of proteins. The only miss was a strange variation of poriyal, a coconut-flecked vegetable saute from the Southern state of Tamil Nadu, this one starring broccoli. The ingredients needed to better merge. It tasted like a bowl of prepped ingredients waiting to be cooked. Thankfully, Rasika's date and toffee pudding always banishes any minor disappointments.\",\n",
       "  \"Bajaj is D.C.'s savviest restaurateur. Perhaps he's noticed the lines trailing out the door of Little Serow, the restaurant by Johnny Monis that serves family-style dinners of intense northern Thai cuisine.

Co-founder Alice Waters has done more to implant the words \"local,\" \"seasonal,\" and \"sustainable\" in our brains than any other living soul. She began the restaurant modestly in 1971, serving French food inspired by cookbook authors like Richard Olney and Elizabeth David. Her search for quality ingredients from nearby farmers eventually propelled the California cuisine movement—as did the skills of other freethinking cooks who joined her in the kitchen through the years. In turn they helped foster pride in homegrown foods and traditions among chefs in the country\\'s other regions. The Chez Panisse philosophy rerouted America\\'s culinary trajectory. Its continuing insistence on simplicity also generates its share of backlash.',\n",

       "  '\"It\\'s designed that way,\" I respond. We\\'re gazing at our most substantial of five courses: fetching, misshapen hunks of wild King salmon grilled and topped with a sauce of chopped mushrooms. On the side are leeks braised in red wine, a little tuft of salad greens, and several stalks of asparagus. Of course every element on the plate exudes freshness. The mushrooms are morels, dark as olives and forest-deep in their earthiness. Their flavor melds with the salmon\\'s gentle, fishy musk. A thoughtful play of textures banters between the soft leeks and the snap of asparagus. Nothing sets off fireworks, but it\\'s a graceful plate of food.',\n",
       "  'Risi e bisi with squid; Grilled wild King salmon',\n",

I eat this food, and I appreciate the lives and labors that went into it. Am I dazzled by the meal? No.\",\n",
       "  \"But I do admire the way the restaurant adheres to its vision: It serves dinner Monday through Saturday, one nightly changing fixed price menu, which gets more complex as the week progresses.

Otherwise, what you'll be eating is a surprise until the week's menu goes live online.\",\n",
       "  'We reserved for a Friday and found ourselves with an all-seafood menu. As it has always been, the dining room feels like an intimate supper club. All signs of the fire that closed the restaurant for three months last year have vanished. The reclaimed redwood paneling gleams ruddy and handsome; the geometric copper light fixtures cast flattering shadows. We had a 6 p.m. reservation and the evening started leisurely. Our bright, engaging server brought out thick slices of sourdough from Acme Bread Company (started by Steven Sullivan, a Chez Panisse alum) and a plate of bacalao crostini with a few olives.',\n",

The restaurant may have started French, but Paul Bertolli, the main chef from 1982 to 1992, shifted the style of cooking toward Italy, a direction the savory kitchen in particular maintains. (Downstairs currently has two chefs, Jérôme Waag and Cal Peternell, who each work like maniacs for six months and then get off the other half of the year, paid, to recharge and research menus. Peternell was in the kitchen during my meal.)\",\n",

We chatted with the table of three next to us, and we tagged along with them on the tour of the kitchen they'd requested. We thanked our hosts, muttered kind words about the food on the way out the door, and felt relaxed on the drive home. Just like eating at an old friend's house.\",\n",

Taking cues from the Connecticut school of pizza, fresh clams dotted the pie, which had also been sprinkled liberally with punchy marjoram. The cheese and tomato sauce fused, the charred crust crackled, and the clam's briny jolt infused every bite. It was the beginning of a spectacular lunch.\",\n",
       "  \"The Cafe at Chez Panisse opened upstairs in 1980 for diners seeking a more casual option, and over the years it has developed its own personality—the spunkier younger sister who's frankly more fun to be around. The à la carte menu has grown in length through the decades, and the items can change even from noon to night, but expect gutsier, more soulful compositions than what's served downstairs. Out of sentimentality I ordered the baked goat cheese covered in bread crumbs and herbs, nestled among garden lettuces, a dish that's been available since the cafe's earliest days. It made the Indian nuances of poached halibut shocking by comparison: The fish came with saffron rice, gingered spinach, rounds of golden beets, and a dollop of coconut-coriander chutney.

The apricot galette looked so simple but contained the universe—a dance of sweet and tart, the crust carrying a whiff of smoke from the wood oven, the vanilla ice cream alongside enhancing without distracting.',\n",
       "  \"I lingered over two other sweets—strawberry-rhubarb shortcake and a honey-yogurt sherbet with roasted blueberries—nearly as transcendent.

Out the window, I could see the lush spring and a cloudless blue sky, and a sliver of San Francisco Bay and the mountains beyond. Yes, I thought.

Fifteen years ago, when I first relished this savory replica of the all-American ice cream cone, the staff brought the snack with a demeanor that announced, \"We\\'re turning fine dining on its head.\" Now it arrives almost as a nostalgic gesture, an opener that says, \"This is where the revolution began—and isn\\'t it still delicious?\"',\n",
       "  'The French Laundry turns 20 next month. Or rather, its incarnation with luminary chef Thomas Keller as its owner does. The 1890 stone building, nestled among vineyards in a small Napa Valley town, began its life as a restaurant under the same name by a couple, Don and Sally Schmitt, in 1977. Keller had trained in restaurants in France and New York and ran a restaurant in Manhattan called Rakel that ultimately failed in 1990. The Schmitts served meals in a Chez Panisse-like format, with one set menu that changed nightly. When Keller took over in 1994, he offered a four- or five-course dinner with options in every category. Soon, he would begin concentrating on tasting menus that included a flurry of whimsical small bites to start the evening.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  '\"Coffee and doughnuts\"',\n",
       "  'In his years between running restaurants, Keller percolated on ideas that would eventually reset the nature of upscale American cooking. At The French Laundry, he melded European technique with dishes that were embedded in our national consciousness. His take on \"coffee and doughnuts\"—cappuccino semifreddo with hot cinnamon-and-sugar-coated orbs—was an early hit and gave him confidence to keep the pushing the boundaries of wit: \"Surf and turf\" with monkfish tail and braised oxtails, \"Caesar salad\" with Parmigiano-Reggiano custards, \"Banana split\" with poached banana ice cream and crepes. Due to Keller\\'s precision, these creations never came off as gimmicky. His approach forged new contextual territory in the food culture, and gave French cuisine—always the basis of his cooking—a place of honor at a time when \"New American\" was the mantra in restaurants.',\n",
       "  \"So much has been said over the years about The French Laundry and the empire it spawned. (Keller hasn't manned the stoves at the Laundry since 2005; chef de cuisine David Breeden oversees the kitchen day-to-day.) I came to a recent meal intrigued to see how the experience fit in among the newer generation of tasting-menu restaurants. Many of them are run by Keller disciples, including Grant Achatz of Alinea and Next in Chicago, Corey Lee of Benu in San Francisco, and Rene Redzepi of Noma in Copenhagen. The relative newcomers take wilder leaps of imagination and exotica than the Yountville standard-bearer, which can seem downright traditional by comparison.\",\n",
       "  'And by no means am I using \"traditional\" as a euphemism for \"boring.\" A person can\\'t feel ennui amid such a whirl of attentiveness, a style of intelligent, unusually personable service perfected by former general manager Laura Cunningham. That rare feeling—of being pampered by knowing guides who establish a specially tailored rhythm and mood—is part of what makes the meal worth the price.',\n",
       "  'Oysters and pearls; Mackerel with Meyer lemon and piquillo pepper',\n",
       "  'My friend and I came for lunch, which to me is the power move at The French Laundry: The food engages the palate and the brain, and it seems more enjoyable to absorb it all midday. We started off with gougères and then the salmon cornet—France and America each in single mouthfuls. The courses seesawed between richer and lighter, sharper dishes. Pleasantly astringent avocado and buttermilk soup came before Keller\\'s signature \"oysters and pearls,\" a sabayon of pearl tapioca with two tiny oysters and a quenelle of white sturgeon caviar that resembled a giant mulberry. To cut the decadence: a square of translucent mackerel, its fishiness assuaged by Meyer lemon and frisky piquillo pepper. A plate of intricately arranged peas and carrots—dewy in their springtime glory, with poached rhubarb and minced hearts of peach palm—acted as a palate cleanser before fried soft-shell crab crowned and asparagus surrounded by onion velouté enriched with crème fraîche.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'Mac and cheese',\n",
       "  \"Part of Keller's intent has been to serve food that evokes emotion, and the highlight that left us exhilarated was one of the restaurant's riffs on macaroni and cheese. The original came with butter-poached Maine lobster, but as restaurants across America glommed onto the idea, Keller and his crew came up with new versions: This one brought together handmade tube pasta, sweetbreads, and a binding sauce fashioned from fava beans. Out came the humidor box, and one of the staffers giddily buried the dish in black truffle shavings. (I should add that the dish comes with a $100 supplement charge atop the meal's $295 base price, but for such dizzying luxury I'd say go for it.)\",\n",
       "  'Herb-roasted veal; \"Pawlet\" cheese course; Sour cherry mousse',\n",
       "  'A veal dish wrapped in leaves and mousse made of cabbage, with a pierogi filled with a ragout of corned veal heart (scrumptious), was followed by a small, charming cheese course: Pawlet, a nutty cow\\'s milk variety from Vermont, was cut in a thin, fluted circle to match a fennel pollen shortbread cookie. Finally, the desserts arrived: sour cherry mousse, then yogurt sherbet with a brown sugar-maple tart, and then a layered chocolate torte flavored with Virginia peanut and caramel made from Banyuls vinegar. And just when we thought we were done, the server arrived with one last treat: \"We couldn\\'t let you leave without our \\'coffee and doughnuts,\\'\" he said. Honestly, we were spent—and the dish has been imitated so often over the last two decades, it had lost its novelty. We ate it more out of politeness than excitement.',\n",
       "  \"I left thinking about meals I'd had at Benu and Saison on the same Bay Area trip. At those next-gen tasting menu restaurants, unexpected ingredients and jolts—a chicharron made from sea cucumber, a kimchi dumpling that shattered in the mouth—made meals as much about novelty as pleasure. The French Laundry is more about experiencing the familiar in elevated ways. I respect both approaches. Which do I recommend more? If you're young and want to understand the groundwork of modern fine dining, head to Yountville. If you've dined before at Keller's paean to perfectionism and have an open mind, try Benu or Saison.\",\n",
       "  \"But even the jaded should keep an eye on The French Laundry. Keller recently announced that he's renovating the restaurant, which will include a new 2,000-square-foot kitchen. The restaurant certainly isn't hurting for reservations, but Keller wants to stay big-picture relevant. I can't imagine the salmon cornet or the coffee and doughnuts will disappear altogether, but I'm guessing we might soon witness new levels of creativity at his flagship.\",\n",

We sank into our chairs in the handsome back room and then watched the staff circle around nearby tables. We began exchanging puzzled glances when no one paused long enough to say hello. Our waiter arrived at last, a glimmer of fluster under his outward composure, and he didn't apologize. He only asked us what we'd like to drink and launched straight into the menu options.

Twenty years ago this July, Meyer and then chef-partner Tom Colicchio implemented a style of service that Meyer had been perfecting at his first venture, Union Square Cafe. The approach was polished yet unusually warm, closing the gap between upscale and casual dining.

Nearly eight years into his run, Anthony and his team put out satisfying, approachable plates that match the cozy-swank ambience. Under the elegant wooden beams and butterscotch light, the legions sigh over dishes like beef tartare, its flavors strong and reassuring, punctuated by pine nuts, pickled mushrooms, capers, and chives. The menu doesn't intend to surprise; it aims to comfort with familiarity and impress with sterling ingredients. \",\n",

The beef was splayed over a bright, masterfully sharp puree that included angelica, green chickpeas, ramps, and spinach. The creamiest chickpea fries stood in for potatoes. And I loved the way Anthony used pork in ways usually associated for beef. A piggy Bolognese tossed with tagliatelle had an appealing unctuousness and meaty bite, and he included the little-seen pork spinalis muscle (sometimes known as the rib cap or deckle in beef) with roasted loin for added richness and textural variation.

Her desserts were singular balancing acts between homey and sophisticated, savory and sweet. I miss them. The gorgeous-to-behold creations by current pastry chef Miroslav Uskokovic, a veteran of Jean Georges, were more fiddly than I've had before at the restaurant: A half-moon of torn angel food cake pieces and other busy bits covered a coconut custard, and a slice of almond cake with rhubarb could have used less saucy swipes and edible flowers and more buttery depth. But that may just be my sentimentality. Next time I'll grab a bar stool in the more casual front room and order the apple crisp, a holdover from Fleming's days (though undoubtedly tweaked), and vanish into my memories. \"],\n",

The metallic sting of the shellfish, the porky wallop of the broth, and the punch of the peppers are perfectly balanced — albeit at nuclear warfare levels of balance. So relief is crucial.

The restaurant, named after the Ivory Coast\\'s largest city, glows late into the evening, a welcoming presence on a darkened block near the Kosciusko Street station. A grid in the window displays the entire menu in 22 color photos, including several stews (called \"sauces\") paired with polished rice, boiled yams, or foutou; a pair of whole-fish platters; plus fried and jerked chicken, which are intended mainly as a come-on to non-West-African patrons.\\n  ',\n",

For some unfathomable reason, a string of holly with red berries runs along one wall up near the ceiling, while another wall is devoted to a rack of gangsta-themed videotapes from Jamaica and Nigeria. A large TV at the front of the house alternates mournful international news with Ivory Coast hip-hoppers wearing animal-print dashikis, backed up by gangs of undulant female dancers not quite in step. The proprietor will come around the counter to greet you, brandishing menus like the one in the window, only smaller and protected by plastic.',\n",
       "  \"Fully enjoying the city's West African eateries takes some practice. You must throw away many of the assumptions you usually bring to a restaurant meal. At Abidjan, after examining the menu, one must begin by asking the jolly, gray-haired proprietor what dishes are actually available that day. Chances are it will be only four or five. In many West African restaurants, the menu is considered a speculative document, generally listing every dish the cook can think of, even ones she has no intention of making. At least the menu gives you a good idea of what constitutes everyday fare for the average Ivory Coast citizen. Without as much meat, of course.\",\n",
       "  \"Your implied social contract with this type of restaurant guarantees you'll be fed a delicious, abundant, inexpensive, and perfectly prepared meal — not that you'll be able to fully exercise your dietary preferences. In this regard, Restaurant Abidjan resembles the earliest European restaurants, medieval lodgings where the innkeeper felt obliged to feed weary travelers, but only offered a single meal assembled at his whim. Yes, Abidjan will feed you well, but you can never be sure what.\",\n",
       "  \"Toss away the idea of courses, too. There are no desserts. There no sides or apps, either, though a plate of sweet fried plantains ($6), enough for three to share, can function in a pinch as a starter, side dish, or even dessert. Also don't expect much in the way of beverages, though a pint of ginger or sorrel punch ($3.50) made with pineapple juice is often available. Leaving a burning sensation on the lips, the ginger is especially recommended. But the restaurant devotes so little attention to stocking beverages, your best bet is Mexican or Japanese beer from the Palestinian bodega a block east. Hooray for BYOB!\",\n",
       "  \"So what should you expect to eat at Restaurant Abidjan? If you're lucky, the peanut sauce ($7) will be available. It's like a liquid peanut butter sandwich, though one that has meat bobbing in it – either lamb, oxtail, or chicken, depending on the mood of the cook. Order foutou to go with it. This is a mash made of plantain flour, notable for its bouncy texture and plainish flavor. Nip off a piece with your thumb and forefinger and dip it deeply in the sauce, then close your eyes and chew. There are other mashes, too, including placali, an oblong wad of fermented yuca with a sour taste, said to satisfy hunger longer than milder mashes. Other alternatives include a plain plate of polished white rice, and something called tomato rice ($5), which is a moist morass of grain soaked in red sauce with some mixed vegetables thrown in, tasting like something you might find in a Spanish or Mexican restaurant.\",\n",
       "  \"Sporadically available are okra, palm-oil, eggplant, and chicken sauces ($7 each). The okra provides a lesson in mucoidal viscosity, and every friend I've taken to taste it has fallen immediately in love. If nothing else, the sauce demonstrates a familial connection between Louisiana Creole and West African cuisines. The palm oil sauce is reminiscent of the kind of canned meat gravy you might ladle over your instant mashed potatoes in Mid-America.\",\n",
       "  'The dish presentation is refreshingly rudimentary. Grilled lamb ($7) is three good-size chops accompanied by nothing but a pool of the same tomato relish we\\'ve seen before. Paleo dieters take note. Something you shouldn\\'t miss once you\\'ve tried the peanut and okra sauces is the national dish: a fried whole snapper, head on, accompanied by attieke (pronounced \"ah-check-ay\"), a tart stodge of fermented manioc meal that looks like white couscous. As with the sauces and mashes, you must buy the components of the meal separately ($12 and $3, respectively). To fully enjoy the attieke — which can be a bit dry on its own — mix the tomato relish and chopped French salad that comes with the fish into the starch before consuming it.',\n",

Her father, Henry, opened Yank Sing's primary location in the Rincon Center, near the Embarcadero in the Financial District, in 2001. Dim sum restaurants are often roomy—servers need space to jockey the metal carts stacked with steamer baskets and the trolleys lined with plates—but the size of this place boggles. The restaurant proper sits 250, and on weekends it fills the center's soaring lobby, decorated with WPA-era murals depicting moments in Northern California's history (some of them violent), with tables to feed another 250.

Honey baked sea bass for $19.95? Curried cream cheese shrimp wanton for $10.50? Pass and pass. Sticking largely to the classics, my group got out for around $33 a head.',\n",

The cart pulls up, we peer at the options as the server opens steamer lids for inspections, and in a flurry we have a feast on the table. I always start with har gau, the coral hue of chopped shrimp and bamboo shoots blushing through the tight, filmy wrappers. My chopsticks jut out next for siu mai, the crimped, open-faced dumplings nestling bits of shrimp and pork. Other worthy fillings include scallop, snow pea tendrils, and mushrooms scented with ginger, and a gauzy shrimp variation revved with cilantro and chives. Some people use soy sauce as a dim sum condiment, others like hot mustard; I prefer the kick of crimson chile oil.',\n",

       "  'Beyond dumplings? Try the baked cha siu bao (smooth pucks filled with sweet-and-sour pork barbecue) over their steamed counterparts. The one modernized dish I enjoy is a generous cabbage salad scattered with honey-glazed walnuts, which lends crunch to the meal—as do Chinese greens slicked with oyster sauce. Sure, grab some spring rolls if they beckon. Just not the ones gilded with sea bass. For dessert the sesame balls come straight from the fryer; the staff cuts them open to reveal their creamy-sweet interior. A couple bites of egg custard tart cut the last few sips of strong tea. Yank Sing can stuff its customers silly in less than half an hour.

(Ruth Reichl wondered why Korean food wasn\\'t more popular in the pages of the New York Times in 1993.) Choi\\'s other restaurants, including A-Frame and rice bowl-themed Chego, blend global flavors overtly. Pot fixes more directly on Korean flavors, but through Choi\\'s personal sensibilities.

I was initially put off my feed by the frisee aux lardons ($13), which has few bacon lardons and lots of browned pita bits instead, seeming a little like bait-and-switch. Though quite beautiful with its two runny poached eggs plastered on top – the salad had no mustard vinaigrette to goose it up; in fact, no dressing at all. But the moules frites Dijonnaise ($16) swamped in white wine, mustard, and cream was totally on the money, with nice fries.

The town was carved from a tree nursery owned by one M.A. Murray around 1890, but nowadays, most of the land is occupied by trim stuccoed houses and brick apartment buildings, while the balance is mainly small cafes, brightly decorated with colorful signs broadcasting their specialties. In fact, outside of Manhattan's 32nd Street, no place in the five boroughs has a better collection of Korean restaurants.\",\n",
       "  \"Focusing on tabletop barbecue, Mapo occupies a prime corner overlooking the green, where, with springtime upon us, yellow daffodils rise in random clumps. The windows are plastered with banners of bright red meat calculated to set the salivary glands flowing. Inside, there's room for around 50 diners at 10 or so brightly lit tables. Here and there, broad-flanked Black Angus cattle pose in pastures like magazine pin-ups, as if too aware of their intrinsic attractiveness. From a raised platform a manager surveys the room, monitoring the comings and goings of employees dashing around the room like cowpokes, setting up and breaking down barbecues, distributing bottles of beer and platters of raw meat, busing tables, and forestalling groups of diners waiting hungrily in a knot just inside the door.\",\n",

Two reasons: the place cooks its meat over lump charcoal, imbuing it with smoky savor. And rather than serving flesh in small, unsatisfying portions, as they do it in Manhattan, Mapo delivers saddlebag-size hanks deeply veined with fat, which renders and sizzles as it hits the grill. Here's how a meal goes down.\",\n",
       "  \"Though Mapo is a full service restaurant, there's no doubt barbecue is its raison d'être. Unlike the 32nd Street barbecues, which offer perhaps a score of grillable choices, Mapo provides only four, and selecting which to get is the most important decision. Top of the line is marinated kalbi, which is fatty beef rib stripped from the bone and soaked in a solution of soy and Asian pear, tenderizing the beef and imparting a slightly sweet and salty taste. For Texans and other barbecue purists, there's an unmarinated version available.\",\n",
       "  \"Pork belly is a compulsory offering for any Korean barbecue joint, thick slices of unsmoked bacon that's mainly fat. Tragically, this cut cannot be cooked directly over the charcoal because it would burst into flame like an improvised explosive device and send diners scurrying from the restaurant. Accordingly, the belly is seared on a domed contraption placed over the grill that prevents it from absorbing much smoke. It's great anyway. The fourth and last choice is also piggy: fat-rimmed ribs that look like boneless pork chops, which cook up nice and smoky directly over the flame.\",\n",
       "  'Portions of kalbi are priced at $34.95, with the pork belly and pork ribs a few dollars less.

On a more recent visit in early spring, three friends and I received 13. Besides the obvious cabbage kimchee, shredded daikon pickle, and cucumber salad, we got sweetened shavings of dried squid, boiled eggs, and chiles in soy sauce, sweet potato noodles with slivers of vegetable, mushroom stems in a tart salty dressing, sweet thick swatches of tofu skin, and ripply cubes of something amusingly called devil's tongue jelly, dressed with scallions and sesame oil.\",\n",

These banchan serve a triple function throughout the meal: as appetizers, as side dishes, and as condiments with the grilled meat. By the way, when you run out of any of them – the long-aged cabbage kimchee is invariably gone by the middle of your repast – you should ask the waitress for more, and she readily complies.\",\n",

Everyone pulls back apprehensively as he thrusts the smudge pot into a depression in the middle of the table, shooting up sparks into the overhead hood. Another employee installs a stainless steel grill over the live charcoal. Next the waitress appears with your meat.

Order one and they'll do it for you in the kitchen and deliver it already grilled. This could actually be good in summer if you don't want to sit on top of glowing coals. Even when you barbecue at the table, the waitress does most of the work, flopping the meat, snipping it with scissors into smaller chunks, then mounting the grill on an elevated rack and pushing the meat to the sides when it's perfectly done. At this point you serve yourself from the grill using chopsticks, or push the meat to the center if you want it done further or blackened to crispness. My advice: don't. The meat is tenderest when rare, and further grilling, while adding smokiness, can make the meat tough.\",\n",

I was eight minutes late to my 7:30 reservation, and one of the soft-spoken servers was waiting for me by the door. She led me to the 10-person sushi counter and, with a nod from the chef, sat me directly in front of Urasawa. There was a group of three women to my right, a party of four to my left, and empty seats on either side of me. We were the sum of the evening's customers. The room was simple, with walls painted gold and sage and white. Urasawa was dressed in a black kimono-like haori with the sleeves tied back. Blowsy cherry blossoms splayed from a vase behind him.

Danny Meyer has perhaps struck this balance better than anyone else at The Modern, a Michelin-starred spot with small plates in its bar room and set-menu dining in the back.

       "[['The pan-regional Indian restaurant sends out homey dishes with punch',\n",
       "  'The “oohs” and “ahhs” follow dum biryani ($19) as it bobs across the room. The casserole is topped by a sheet of naan dough that imprisoned the volatile flavors as the dish baked. This sealing-in is what the “dum” refers to, in a recipe attributed by the menu to the far northern city of Lucknow, India, though biryani is more often associated with the southern city of Hyderabad.',\n",
       "  'Arriving at our table, the waiter takes a big spoon and saws the nicely browned crust with a circular motion. Then he flips the flap of crust over so the steam spirals out, redolent of saffron and sweet spices. Inside, rice shimmers with chunks of bone-in goat and shredded herbs. The first bite proves exquisite, especially when further moistened with the tart pomegranate raita provided.',\n",
       "  '“My purpose at Adda,” executive chef Chintan Pandya told me one evening, “is to reproduce the true taste of Indian home cooking.” He continued, “I’m from Gujarat and Mumbai and owner Roni Mazumdar is from Kolkata in West Bengal, so we come from different places, but certain things are shared. I’m trying to cook the way our mothers did.”',\n",
       "  'It’s an effort rarely found in New York City Indian restaurants: Not only is Adda making a conscientious effort to dig into the regionalities of Indian cuisine, it’s doing so with accessibly priced, homestyle fare, where all dishes fall under $20. ',\n",
       "  'Many chefs at Indian restaurants in neighborhoods across NYC adapt recipes for what they think are American customer preferences, and the more ambitious pan-regional places skew more expensive, including Pandya’s Greenwich Village restaurant Rahi. But Adda does neither. And the quest to replicate home cooking at Adda is, perhaps, why the dishes are a degree hotter and richer, with some ingredient choices and combinations not commonly found in other New York Indian restaurants. ',\n",
       "  'Take “seasonal saag paneer” ($15). Many restaurants stick to mustard greens and spinach or substitute spinach entirely, which makes for a mellower dish. But Adda’s version is composed of whatever greens happen to be in the market in the moment. The other evening, it included red amaranth leaves, produce that’s common in traditional Indian cooking and now stylish in the States as an antioxidant. ',\n",
       "  'What’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many NYC Indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. The problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. Adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.',\n",

I’ve been schvitzing here for the better part of a decade, a love affair that began because another one ended. Briefly: She moved out of my place and into his.

In any case, cooks slather the nuggets in mornay and duck gravy. This would be a reasonably nourishing dish at a roadside diner in, let’s say, Montana, after a long day of skiing and hunting elk.

Small mountains of ice hold a seafaring selection not often seen in New York: emperor fish, with anime eyes and a millenial-pink sheen. Carabinero shrimp, as unnaturally red as a Coca-Cola can. Rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest Jurassic Park film. This is where you choose your dinner — a process that occurs, almost universally, after you’ve plowed through half a pomegranate daiquiri. It’s the maritime equivalent of shopping for engagement rings with a glass of bubbly. ',\n",

       "  'Make no mistake: You have been primed for a shakedown, Cartier-style. ',\n",
       "  'One of the holy grails of modern fine dining has been finding a way to de-emphasize the transactional experience of a meal. The culinary arts have always been uniquely handicapped in this sense. Opera would have a different feel if a soprano kicked off the evening by telling spectators “this aria is going to cost you a ton,” and then sent out a check to everyone at the end of the night.',\n",
       "  'Some of America’s most expensive restaurants have solved this problem via a ticketing system, having guests pay for meals in advance. Milos takes a different tack, obscuring as many prices as possible throughout the course of an evening. ',\n",
       "  'The saga starts back at that tour. The captains sing nuanced praises for the barbounia, fagi, and lavraki. They know which ones are oily, which ones are buttery, and that there’s “not much cheek meat in the turbot.” They know every detail — except for the prices, a subject they avoid so diligently that one wonders whether these veritable ichthyologists skipped a very specific day of school.',\n",
       "  'By-the-pound prices are posted above most fish. That price, though, means you’re looking not at the actual cost but the raw data for an incomplete math equation. Either way, you’re paying more attention to the waiter’s musings on the Milos yacht (which you can apparently rent in the Aegean Sea), or how a two-and-a-half-pound lobster would be nice for a solo diner. The lobsters bear no price tags, which is dangerous for a main that costs more than round-trip airfare to Chicago.',\n",
       "  'You return to your linen-clad table and ask for two langoustines and a turbot. The server says the whole fish is three pounds. You know the price is $56 per pound — you were smart enough to take notes — so you figure you’ll be out $160. And yet, when the bill comes, the price is $197. That can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil. Then you take a closer look at the check and notice the fish is half a pound heavier than the waiter told you it would be. Whoops!',\n",

They’re a cool $87 for an appetizer’s worth of meat. This is when you start to spew expletives. ',\n",
       "  'The well-heeled might find this system unobtrusive, and perhaps there’s something honest about assigning a very specific price to an individual fish based on its weight.

Skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. But from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. The chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. This is unexpected. ',\n",
       "  'Indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. Its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to Dutch to Middle Eastern to Indian to Polynesian to Chinese. But broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. It’s a style of cooking New York restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the Standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at Nargis. ',\n",
       "  'And yet at Wayan in Nolita, due to fire code issues, the team executes this Southeast Asian staple via a European-style griddle. The skewers do not suffer from the adaptation. ',\n",
       "  'If chicken satays sound boring, consider this: The thigh meat exhibits the silkiness of tofu, while a beige peanut sauce flaunts the richness of cream. It’s like blanquette de veau on a stick, albeit energized with coconut and red curry. Pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. And sticks of Florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ',\n",
       "  'Ochi, a Jakarta native involved in everything from menu development to tableware, and her chef-husband Cédric, have given New York a thrilling addition to its contemporary Southeast Asian scene. Like Uncle Boons, Kopitiam, Jeepney, and elsewhere, Wayan shows off compelling strains of modernity rooted in tradition.',\n",

       "  'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away, this is the type of restaurant one might have expected from Cédric’s father, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the Franco-American chef who shook up New York gastronomy in the late ’90s and early aughts. From his eponymous Central Park flagship to his clubby Spice Market in the Meatpacking District, he drew upon his days cooking in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong to fuse Asian sensibilities with Continental fare. He flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier Midtown venues. The flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.',\n",
       "  'That style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at Wayan. Cédric, a Bangkok-born chef who also runs Perry St, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. You roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.',\n",
       "  'Particularly breathtaking is sop buntut, Javanese oxtail soup. The broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. On the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. Fancy French chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. And that’s precisely what Cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm Maillard char.',\n",
       "  'Really, if there were any fears about whether Wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the New York restaurant world. The prevailing Jean-Georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to Asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland East-meets-West menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. ',\n",
       "  'Such fears are not entirely unwarranted. Vong Kitchen in Jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” Cédric and Jean-Georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the Wayan menu. There’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in Nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any Nobu or Robuchon in Moscow or Tokyo. There’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. ',\n",
       "  'And then there’s Wayan’s crabcake, garnished with a vertical build of cucumbers and sprouts as if it were one of Alfred Portale’s “tall” dishes from the 1980s. With so many brilliant Southeast Asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why Wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the American country club variety. Make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. But still, it’s disappointing that Cédric, instead of trying to introduce New Yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. ',\n",
       "  'The name Wayan, incidentally, is Balinese; it means first-born. The Tao-ish design (Rockwell Group) is a hat tip to that island as well, with reclaimed wood and hanging vines evoking its vernacular architecture. The decorative spices strewn throughout the restaurant, from cinnamon to star anise, by contrast, feel like an ode to Pottery Barn.',\n",
       "  'More inspirational is the nasi goreng, a must-order. Indonesian meals are often built around rice, and Wayan’s version of the staple is deeply flavorful with the aroma of garlic. Pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of Twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk. ',\n",
       "  'Or for an equally complex starch, the kitchen slicks Chinese-style lamian noodles with kecap manis, a molasses-like soy sauce, as well with a throat-tickling blend of chiles and black peppercorns.

Cédric pours a layer of passionfruit juice, along with its seeds, along the top layer of the confection. You dip in your spoon as if you were digging into a halved tropical fruit, but what comes out is not yellow flesh but rather oozy, vanilla-laced pudding. The juice acts as an assertive, acidic counterpoint to the indulgent dairy. Jean-Georges also does a bit of trompe l’oeil over on Central Park West, where caviar sits atop what appears to be a lemon — it’s really just citron gelee.

And instead of fried tortillas, GupShup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from Gujarat. And while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. It’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.',\n",
       "  'For “tacos,” Singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. The soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. It conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. You continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of Gramercy.',\n",

       "  'There are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of Indian fare in New York. One of them, which includes venues like Chintan Pandya’s Adda and Hemant Mathur’s Sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from Kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). These venues function to remind New Yorkers that South Asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.',\n",
       "  'Singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. Its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of South Asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. One thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of Rahi in Greenwich Village or the foie gras duck haleem of Baar Baar, a frenetic Bowery space with a Buddakan-style vibe.',\n",
       "  'GupShup, by Indian-born restaurateur Jimmy Rizvi (Korali Estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. It finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist Karishma Naran’s mural of a modern Indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.',\n",
       "  'That means Saturday morning avocado toast. The line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether Singh adds anything to the conversation. The chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. It would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. ',\n",
       "  'GupShup’s ramen is another misstep. That’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a Southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. It’s the execution that’s flawed. The ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.',\n",
       "  'Those mistakes aside, Singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. There’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. Or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. Ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. ',\n",
       "  'But just as Momofuku Bang Bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, GupShup’s own evocation, blending Indian sensibilities with Jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. The puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. The tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of Alka Seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.',\n",
       "  'Or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in Delhi. Vendors typically finish it off with butter. Singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. But somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. ',\n",
       "  'Sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. If the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. ',\n",

       "  'Singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. The kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. Tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.',\n",
       "  'Singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at Indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. Here at GupShup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. It uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.',\n",
       "  'Beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of Kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of New York restaurants. Maybe that will change after more folks try GupShup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. Nizams haleem, a staple of Ramadan iftar dinners in Hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. The humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. ',\n",
       "  'Too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. It came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. Maybe GupShup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? ',\n",
       "  'Weird things tend to happen here. The host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. When someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” The complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.',\n",
       "  'Pre-made desserts, however, are still available if the pastry chef is absent, though it’s not clear whether that’s a good thing.

It claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy Brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, Pop Rocks. The venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own Instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. Another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. This is, to be fair, all what one might expect at Hudson Yards’s Equinox Hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.',\n",

There, among the normals, scores of people who look like cutouts from Men’s Health are brunching. Arms bulge through artisanal sweatshirts.

Those who look past the GOOP-y branding and weekend DJs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. At least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise Mid-Atlantic fare. ',\n",

       "  'It is difficult to consider Hudson Yards without understanding its larger missteps, particularly the fact that the entire compound functions as a taxpayer-subsidized bastion for the rich. But one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the Vessel. Electric Lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off Midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. ',\n",
       "  'Here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the Bank of America building, the New Yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the Hudson River, and the sun setting over the Jersey City Heights. Here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped Vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.',\n",
       "  'Even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. Try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. Chef Kyle Knall (Maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. As the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. This is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. Knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. A touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. For more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.',\n",
       "  'But for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. Knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. But he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.',\n",
       "  'Much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. Chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. Equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. The flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. It all makes for stellar DIY tacos.',\n",
       "  'If the the beet-yogurt “Beauty Bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the New American style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. For example: Knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. It’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. ',\n",
       "  'Labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by Equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. Still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. Clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-Western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. It’s curious how, at Electric Lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in Hudson Yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots.

At Masa, I watched a party of four wolf down $700 worth of wagyu in a minute. “You’ll be able to pay for a year’s worth of flights with the points from this meal,” one of them said to the man stuck with the check. At Ichimura, I saw a group of tourists ignore the fragile nigiri the chef was serving them, letting two or more pieces collect on their plates as they tapped away on their phones.

The white pudding was stunning, enrobing the tongue with its fats and softening the briny blow of the urchin. A few minutes later, as I was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “Wow, they nailed that.” He went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television.

It also helps tame the musk of Hokkaido uni, whose tidal aroma lingers for a full minute after consumption. And it adds a dose of balance to exceedingly fatty bluefin. The chef slices this breed thicker than others. It doesn’t so much melt as bounce with a supple springiness. But when the fishy oils start to overwhelm, the acid kicks in to lend a proper dose of pucker. ',\n",
       "  'If only the nigiri courses included a wider variety of fish. And if only my enjoyment of the o-toro wasn’t interrupted by bro-man next to me.

It’s as if someone tried to chat with you during the key plot twist of Jordan Peele’s Us at the movies. You don’t get to hit rewind.

He doesn’t cross-hatch it like some, or jazz it up with citrus like others. He simply presents it as a slick study in the color white — wearing an invisible cloak of sweet soy. The cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an MSG-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess. The rice, while still distinctly tangy, is a touch less vinegared than at Noda. It is more “one” with the fish, rather than distinct.',\n",

       "  'Sustainability issues notwithstanding, there’s something depressingly uniform about having to make one’s way through the same four slices of tuna — or five, if you count the inevitable toro hand roll — at a fancy omakase spot, sometimes taking up nearly half the nigiri portion of the meal. That’s not to be disrespectful of the craft; part of the bliss of sushi is akin to the joy of watching Shakespeare, seeing the same stories tweaked ever so gently by different directors. ',\n",
       "  'But to continue the metaphor: Shakespeare wrote a lot of plays, and Abe and Tsunoda — and some of their peers — seem to follow this one particular bluefin script just a little too closely.

An ambitious Indian spot in Gramercy sends out pitch-perfect tandoori chicken — and guacamole to boot. An Asian rotisserie in Midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox. And now at Haenyeo, a knockout of a Korean hangout in Park Slope, the kitchen whips up bouillabaisse as masterful as that of any Gallic temple. ',\n",
       "  'Chef-owner Jenny Kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic French soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and Pernod. The rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. A filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in Marseille — glutinous rice cakes. Mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. And then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen. The warmth of the stew doubles the urchin’s natural sugars and triples its musk. ',\n",

       "  'If that’s still too European, Kwak offers more traditional dishes too, from bulgogi to raw fish bibimbap bowls — alongside with Mexican-leaning fundidos and Louisiana-style shellfish. Haenyeo might take its name from the women who free-dive for seafood off of Korea’s Jeju Island, but its approach to cuisine is often decidedly and unabashedly internationalist.',\n",
       "  'Park Slope’s collection of Korean restaurants is still small, which is fitting. That country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of East Village representation there before Kwak and her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. The duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s Korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd Street. The mother-daughter team opened up Dok Suni’s on First Avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.',\n",
       "  'Writers praised their efforts, though they sometimes used language that should’ve come across as troublesome then, as it is now. New York Magazine’s Fran Schumer began her Suni’s review with this slight: “You’d rather have spaghetti than kimchi any day, but there are times when cold pickled cabbage tastes that good.” ',\n",
       "  'New York Times critic William Grimes lauded Kwak’s use of tasting menus to “demystify” Korean food at Do Hwa in the West Village. “For years the city’s Korean restaurants made no concessions to newcomers, who faced a struggle figuring out what the dishes were, how to order them and how to eat them,” he wrote in 2000. ',\n",

The wait on Saturdays can surpass 90 minutes.',\n",

Kwak grills them over hardwood briquettes, a hat tip to the New Orleans heritage of her husband, Terrence Segura, with whom she shares ownership.

The Wellfleet bivalves display an aggressive plumpness; they pop with a gentle press of the tongue, gushing with hot seaweed butter.',\n",

Here, that ingredient constitutes just the epidermal layer of a deeper, bubbling casserole. Beneath the scorched cheese, an aggressively milky Oaxacan variety, lies a pool of chile sauce and mounds of tteokbokki, oblong Korean rice cakes. Pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface. The combination of flavors and textures — chewy rice cakes, hot peppers, tart sauce, spiced sausage, and stretchy, melty cheese — feels like less of a true fundido and more of a Korean-Mexican riff on baked ziti.

       "  'Then, a moment later, Kwak switches gear to modern-refined fare. She serves ordinary grilled mackerel in a very distinct way, by pairing it with square sheets of nori. The mackerel is soft and neutral, boasting gently smoky overtones. It’s borderline boring until you wrap it in seaweed, which imparts the fish with a hint of brine and a crisp, snappy texture. You dunk the hand roll, a striking contrast of white and green, in crimson gochujang paste, lighting up the palate with salt and sweet chiles.',\n",

Better are the puffy fried chicken bites laced with jalapenos, as well as the Korean seafood stew, a smaller, more classic answer to the fancier bouillabaisse. The soup, chock full of silky soybean curd and firm shrimp, is milder in flavor than the spendier French version, sporting just a touch of shellfish concentrate.

If the place seems eerily familiar, that’s because it was the former and much-missed bistro DuMont. Now, the front room is quiet and serene, with a bar running along one side and an open kitchen at the end of the room, so open you can reach in and grab a loaf of freshly made bread, warm, moist, and with a dense crumb.',\n",
       "  'But a crooked hallway runs around the kitchen to the place most diners settle down: the covered rear patio. With a black interior and bright spotlights, it feels like an airport runway at midnight. The patio seats 70 or so, and potted plants are scattered here and there. Big tables can be easily pushed together into bigger tables, where groups seeking post-work pizza hunker down, with huzzahs rising up to the retractable ceiling.',\n",
       "  'Let’s ignore the pinsa for a minute. Romans are very fond of variety meats, and evidence of this is a marvelous pig head roulade ($11), composed of smoky and greasy swirls of white fat and pink flesh. There’s also a tripe dish, Roman-style in a cheesy tomato sauce. What’s the difference between it and the famed tripe of Florence? Well, Roman tripe is further seasoned with fresh mint, an herb often seen in Roman cooking. You’ll be seeing more of it at Montesacro.',\n",

Most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal Romanesco, also undercooked; and Brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. The notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash. It gets crumbed like tempura, making the mellow orange vegetable crunchy and soft at the same time, and then dribbled with honey and heaped with grated cheese. Get three orders and it could happily be your entire meal.',\n",
       "  'Pastas play an important, if minor, role on the bill of fare, and all I’ve tasted have been unfailingly excellent. Closely associated with Rome, egg-yolky carbonara ($18) shines yellow in its bowl, dotted with cured guanciale in little salty tidbits and poured over mezze maniche, stunted tubules that trap more sauce than the spaghetti traditionally used. The effect is like breakfast bacon and eggs.',\n",
       "  'But make sure you examine the easy-to-miss special menu, which flaps on a tiny slip of paper stapled to the regular one. Special pastas have included potato gnocchi, soft as a winter mitten, mired in a fibrous beef cheek sauce that clings in great globs to the pasta, and burrata-filled ravioli lavished with fresh chanterelles and grated truffle pecorino. At $20 for a substantial serving, how can the restaurant afford to offer it?',\n",
       "  'The five-item list of specials that day was particularly compelling due to its component of fresh mushrooms, served at just the season when they’re harvested in Italy. This is meta-restaurateuring at its best, meaning certain indefinable features besides the food will transport you to Rome. There was also a wild boar chop in a ragu of fresh porcinis, and a pinsa that featured Italian sausage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. A friend and I ordered all three mushroom specials that evening and enjoyed a fungal orgy.',\n",
       "  'There are only three proper secondi: a fish, a steak, and a chicken. The waiter warned us away from the steak, which comes in a salsa verde more appropriate to Florentine cooking. You might choose the crisp-skinned chicken pressed under a brick instead, but conventional entrees here will never be the highlight of your meal.',\n",

Yes, it tastes like the world’s best tuna salad sandwich.

It’s a cross between the Italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the Shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. You pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. It never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. ',\n",

       "  'The two-month-old Red Paper Clip, an uneven solo debut from Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. One is about a duo of Blue Hill at Stone Barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. As sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. ',\n",
       "  'Contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while Luthun in the West Village and Reverence in Harlem represent newer entrants to the field. And while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to Red Paper Clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. The people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.',\n",
       "  'The presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of China. Chen, a native New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, and Gyamtso, who was raised in Tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Himalayan ingredients with those from France, Italy, Japan, and elsewhere. That’s no small matter. While a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, Chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as Korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.',\n",
       "  'A waiter shaves black truffles over XLB agnolotti.',\n",
       "  'Tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.',\n",
       "  'But the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. A restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. And inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that Chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their Western (or Japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see Chen and Gyamtso prove folks wrong.',\n",
       "  'There are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. Corey Lee’s Benu in San Francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while Kato in Los Angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other Taiwanese delicacies. But in New York, an expression of Chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of XO sauce here, a dab of indiscernible Sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.',\n",
       "  'It’s for this reason that one might scoff at Red Paper Clip’s Sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. A sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. Then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. Slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. And finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. Visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an Estela or a Wildair, but its DNA feels Sichuan through and through.',\n",
       "  'Then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. It’s just another carpaccio.',\n",
       "  'Here’s simplicity at its best: Chen and Gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. This infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. Things are quite lovely. Until they’re not. During another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.',\n",
       "  'Therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of September. Underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that Chen and Gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. Red Paper Clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. ',\n",
       "  'Or consider the lobster three ways. There’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. The butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. And the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. Mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.',\n",
       "  'That criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. They have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. Occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. An act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. But it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. ',\n",
       "  'The late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. The kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. These “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. Whimsical moments like these suggest that Red Paper Clip will eventually find its groove. For now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.',\n",

That style of cooking is called Nikkei, a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the South American country’s culinary ethos. Scores of Japanese people emigrated to Peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to U.S. internment camps during World War II.',\n",

He pairs fried Iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. And he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an Andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. The mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.',\n",

Rice crackers hide a pile of tender lobster, displaying a charcoal-grilled singe, and smoky chunks of corazon — no gamier than skirt steak. It’s a surf and turf like no other; the shellfish jus and beefy heart drippings, fortified with oregano and vinegar, enrich a serving of sushi rice underneath.',\n",

He takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. Tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. The combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.',\n",

Japanese restaurants love to highlight the snappy texture of the digestive organ, but Llama San takes a more rustic tact, braising them until they’re barely firmer than a chicken nugget. The little knobs, which flaunt just an inkling of poultry funk, sit sandwiched between an egg omelet and a layer of rice.

The partying was wild at times, but it never truly devolved into the type of Rich Kids of Instagram debauchery that nearby spots became known for; there were no dance-party brunches where magnums of Champagne came with sparklers or where jeroboams (if you don’t know what that is, you can’t afford one) triggered recognition by the DJ.',\n",

And in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin.

So it’s not too much of a stretch that this neighborhood flourishes again as a bastion of regional Chinese cooking. Part of the reason is the proximity of Columbia University, where Asia-born students and faculty crave restaurants that provide a better taste of back home.',\n",

The mural is a continuation of his video animation series “New Classics of Mountains and Seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by.

The specimen is a buffalo carp, and more of the collar than usual is generously included, so diners don’t have to poke at the eyes and pull swatches of skin away from the cheeks to reveal some of the sweetest reservoirs of flesh.

The chicken parts are accompanied by various vegetables. What a lovely sight!

The small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus. One invention that doesn’t work is braised fish with perilla ($28.95).

One of the most intriguing regional dishes comes from Dongbei in the far northeast, where sweet and sour was supposedly invented.

       "  'Six restaurants in India Square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. It’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to India with the Muslim Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of Lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern India, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of Hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.',\n",

Over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear.

       "  'Some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the Hyderabadi style. The flagship of this fleet is Hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. Break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern Indian biryanis.',\n",
       "  'Other versions of the Hyderabadi style deploy goat, mutton, ground mutton, shrimp, Indo-Chinese chile cauliflower, paneer given a smoky flavor by being pre-cooked in the tandoori oven, and boiled eggs.

       "  'The final three biryanis on a menu created by owners Fahad Kolani and John Sehpur, plus chef Ravi Rajendran, are attributed to the Vijayawada style, and you can tell the minute you look at them because the rice is darker and richer tasting. The one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern India. “But it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” Kolani cautions. “It’s more of a green pickle gravy. It shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern India.”',\n",
       "  'Finally, when the version known as Vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. Though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, Vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the Hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices.

The bill of fare includes several Indo-Chinese recipes, a full selection of tandoori-baked meats, and northern Mughal vegetable standards like saag paneer and aloo gobi, in addition to a slew of specifically Hyderabadi specialties. Street-food staple chicken majestic ($10.95) is one of those, coarsely shredded and breaded poultry in a lively yogurt sauce colored bright yellow by turmeric.

Koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; Park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel.

Expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen Nobus across the world. Chang has avoided this conundrum so far. As he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from Paul Carmichael’s Caribbean-Pacific tastings at Seibo in Sydney to Max Ng’s Singaporean-accented dishes at Ssäm Bar.',\n",

But because this wouldn’t be a true Chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, Park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. She tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. At the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top.

Same goes for the cakes coated in Parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites.

Served at a small auberge in Normandy, the fish came in a “sputtering” butter sauce, while the delicate flesh exhibited a “light but distinct taste of the ocean,” she wrote. Nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of European and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era. Wait captains normally debone the fish tableside, pair it with a restrained sauce, and sometimes toss in a few capers.',\n",

Waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. The flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. It doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. It is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. ',\n",

       "  'At a proper fine dining establishment, the kitchen never sends out a fat slice of wagyu or butter-poached lobster as a first course, nor does a tasting of yakitori or Korean barbecue typically begin with the namesake items.

The feast crescendos with a fistful of ethereal tagliolini al ragu — more on that in a bit — and then finishes with anolini, little ham-stuffed ravioli covered in Parmesan fondue. A server drizzles 25-year balsamic all over them, a dark, agrodolce counterpart to the stark white sauce. It’s not quite dessert, but it’s enough of a cheese course to serve as the meal’s logical coda.',\n",

Chef Stefano Secchi’s ability to make this feel like a complete meal, with all its fluctuations, suggests he’s only beginning to show off his true potential.',\n",
       "  'Rezdôra, which also offers a la carte selections under $30, marks a vital moment in the state of New York Italian dining. It represents a rare high-profile Big Apple restaurant led by a noted alum from Osteria Francescana. That three-Michelin-starred temple in Modena, led by the charismatic Massimo Bottura, is famous for its avant-garde approach to the foods of Emilia-Romagna. Think: a lemon tart that recalls a Jackson Pollock painting, or a dish called “Eel swimming up the Poe river,” which Bottura claims is “both recipe and fable.”',\n",
       "  'Alas, the only real resemblance Rezdôra bears to Francescana are the whimsical names of certain dishes. There’s “Cow grazing in Emilia” for a simple course of Creekstone beef. The cut sports a straightforward bovine punch and a neat little herb salad. “Grandma walking through forest,” in turn, is the long-winded moniker for green cappelletti. The noodles, which look like the cute conical hats that Robin Hood wore in the 1973 Disney cartoon, are topped with verdant spring peas, stuffed with sweet ricotta, and placed atop an earthy mash of black fungi. This is your salad course.',\n",
       "  'If Francescana is all about modernism, Rezdôra leans more smartly classical. This jibes with New York’s larger gastronomic pulse, which tends to favor technique, regionalism, culinary straightforwardness, and sleepy steakhouses over chemistry-like wizardry. But neither that reality nor the generic design of the dining room — plank floors, exposed brick, cramped two-tops, a white marble bar — detracts from the precise rustic cooking that occurs here every night.',\n",
       "  'When one thinks of Emilia-Romagna, a Northern Italian region that lies between the Po River and the Apennine Mountains, staples like Parmesan, prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, truffles, and ragu bolognese come to mind.

About four portions make a light meal for two. Order any of them, from the spaghetti vongole, slicked in a clam sauce as concentrated as a quart of boiled ocean water, to the infrequently seen doppio tortelli. The latter holds salty prosciutto and oozy Parmesan foam in two separate “tubes.” Eating one, slicked in truffle butter, is like chomping on an Italian riff on a soup dumpling; when bit, it squirts out warm sauce with abandon.',\n",

       "  'Though often considered a straightforward dish, ragu famously became an exercise in the avant-garde with Bottura, who once asked “Could a plate of tagliatelle [al ragu] be at the vanguard in the same way as an abstraction of Parmigiano-Reggiano?” His restaurant elevated the staple by cooking the meats — which include beef cheek and veal tail — sous-vide for 24 hours, and it became one of his best-known dishes. Anyone who’s fallen in love with the cooking of Bottura will want to know how Rezdôra compares.',\n",
       "  'Secchi’s recipe is different. He simmers a blend of soffrito, pork shoulder, mortadella, ground pork, and salumi for eight hours with Parmesan sachets. When a patron orders the tagliolini, the kitchen emulsifies it in just a hint of tomato sauce and extra-virgin olive oil. ',\n",
       "  'The cooking is finished in the sauce itself. The same could be said of any pasta, but what makes that technique so powerful here is the thinness of the tagliolini. Al dente isn’t the point. These are softer and stretchier, closer to the texture of rice vermicelli. They’re designed to absorb that wonderful ragu. ',\n",
       "  'Some nights the sauce is thicker and pinker; other evenings, the slurry is looser. But on each visit, the ragu — smooth and devoid of coarse chunks — exhibits nuclear-level meatiness. One doesn’t necessarily taste the flavors of the component salumi; the experience rather conveys an otherworldly level of carnivorous umami. It will make your gums tingle. However rustic its sheen, the dish is as worthy of worship as any of the painterly creations coming out of the kitchen at Atomix.',\n",
       "  'The same, alas, cannot be said of the sweets. Gelati, from pistachio to stracciatella, sport a thin, almost icy texture and forgettable, saccharine flavors. In a city with so many good ice cream purveyors, Secchi should just ditch his product, which wouldn’t pass muster at a 7-Eleven. Generically soft olive oil cake, about on par with something from Entenmann’s, gets the job done with mediocrity, as does a passable tiramisu. ',\n",

Marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. And in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination.

My server suggested a few dishes on the Asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” It was a curious statement. I hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness. The waiter simply felt the need to warn me, preemptively, that a signature preparation was garbage.',\n",

Chefs infuse the meat with inhumane levels of sugar and salt; if the kitchen had any sense of balance, the meat might be accompanied by kimchi or lettuce wraps to keep the seasonings in check. Instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. It turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. ',\n",

The 175-seat space is located on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards, a shiny new Manhattan neighborhood that recalls the sterile dystopian metropolis of Demolition Man. The sound system blasts the type of Mac Miller remixes one might expect to hear at a Times Square H&M.

When it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than Ho, whom Wild Ink’s London-based parent company, Rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. The chef helped bring David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing Korean, French, American, and Japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. He followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at Ma Peche and Montmartre.

Just as his old boss, Chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, Ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. He had been working for “several months” with the Wild Ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, Rhubarb and Ho announced they were parting ways. It just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” Ho said. The fact that Wild Ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.',\n",
       "  'Take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef Peter Jin. The point of this Sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. Jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. The wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.',\n",
       "  'The mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. The same can be said about General Tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to Heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the Cantonese-American staple.',\n",

These techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. ',\n",
       "  'But the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. It’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, Instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or Cheesecake Factory.',\n",

And yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. It’s a loud, beautiful creation.',\n",

       "  'Farida claims to be “the first and only Central Asian cuisine in the heart of Manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. As long as two decades ago, Kosher Uzbek restaurants such as the legendary Taam Tov flourished in the Diamond District, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. I’m not kidding! Though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. ',\n",
       "  'Much more recently, quick-service Central Asian places have popped up, such as Kebab Empire in Hell’s Kitchen, which calls itself Uyghur cuisine. But what Farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service Central Asian restaurants are in places like Sheepshead Bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping Casios like Palmyra, Kaifuem, and the original Nargis, which cater to Central Asian and Russian customers and specialize in banquets.',\n",
       "  'Farida is named after owner Farida Gabbassova-Ricciardelli, who runs the restaurant along with her husband, chef Umitjon Kamolov, nicknamed “John.” The place lies a few steps south of the Port Authority on Ninth Avenue, far from the mass of Central Asian restaurants in Brooklyn. But the couple opted for the Midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” Gabbassova-Ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.',\n",
       "  'It resembles neither a nightclub nor a quick-service cafe, but looks like many of the other small ma-and-pa restaurants that populate Ninth Avenue’s restaurant row. The dining room is deep and narrow, with an alcove in front, and a counter in back that looks into the kitchen. Murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. The servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.',\n",
       "  'A Central Asian menu similar to others in town is offered, though not as complete as those of the Brooklyn plov palaces. Both Kamolov and his co-chef, Firdavs Saidov, hail from Samarkand — one of three most important Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan — while the owner is from Kazakhstan, but they try to have dishes from all over Central Asia.',\n",
       "  'Each part of Uzbekistan has its distinctive version of plov, the rice pilaf with Arabian roots. Elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. Not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. Carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on Farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of Samarkand.',\n",
       "  'The fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. Make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: The same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.',\n",
       "  'That brings us to the kebabs. Here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for Central Asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout Russia in the 19th century. Like Argentines and Texans, Central Asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. Lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at Farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. Get fries or naan bread on the side.',\n",
       "  'The chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.',\n",
       "  'But Farida is hardly a health-food restaurant. Take the Tashkent salad ($15), named after another of Uzbekistan’s glittering Silk Road cities and its capital. This decidedly ungreen salad features shredded daikon radish and shredded beef, with crisp fried onion on top, bound together in the Russian style with thick mayo. ',\n",
       "  'Want something healthy? Check out the mellifluous-sounding achichuk, which is mainly tomatoes goosed with fresh dill and onions. The soups are also magnificent at Farida, including a meal-sized lagman with plenty of handmade noodles something like udon. ',\n",
       "  'There are further high points. Shot with chickpeas, the oxtail stew ($21) is a version of the Samarkand wedding dish, but you don’t have to be betrothed to enjoy it.',\n",
       "  'Farida presents a “greatest hits” of Central Asian cuisine, with an emphasis on Uzbekistan. The food is wholesome and freshly prepared by a chef and crew that display a real zeal for the cuisine. And aside from Texas barbecues, it’s your best chance to get charcoal-grilled meats that taste powerfully of smoke in “the heart of Manhattan,” just as the website says.',\n",

       "  'My general advice for caviar coincides with my maxim for top-shelf Champagne: Don’t order either at restaurants. The only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of Dom Perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. To truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. It needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. A sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like Air’s by Ariel Arce or the Riddler by Jen Pelka, two Village wine bars that make caviar and Champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.',\n",
       "  'There’s something particularly fancy about dropping by Air’s, located in a bustling MacDougal Street townhouse. Green palm fronds rise up from the marble bar. Red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. Teal lights shine behind cases of wine. And diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. Caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. But here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. Baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. The beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. ',\n",
       "  'And just as cookies call for milk, caviar necessitates sparkling wine to gently scrub the palate of all the oceanic salts. Air’s can help in this regard, offering six Champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. At the Riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. True, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.',\n",

That’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. Mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.',\n",
       "  'Air’s and the Riddler rank among those venues — sort of. The interventionist methods used to produce Champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” But the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. ',\n",
       "  'Arce and Pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower Champagnes or other progressive wines. What makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like Krug and Billecart-Salmon to spendier bottle selections.',\n",
       "  'Despite their commonalities, these are two very different venues: The Riddler, which debuted in San Francisco, hawks airy Zalto stems on its website, while Air’s sells discount caviar on its site. Composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at Le Bernardin make up the bulk of the Riddler’s food menu, but Air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. One of them is très bougie. The other one is less bougie. Both are quite good.',\n",
       "  'Shortly after opening, Air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. That translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “Our goal is to expose as much Champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” Arce, a Hell’s Kitchen native, told Eater a few years back. Accordingly, a Jacques Lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “Queen Bae Beyonce Chardonnay,” per Air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.',\n",
       "  'Like Terroir in Tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. It explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. Air’s is correct here: The faint sweetness in the rose Champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. And whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a J.L. Vergnon Murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.',\n",
       "  'Shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. The pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. The eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from Southern U.S. waters. The delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. ',\n",

That’s why we’re doing a burger,” Riddler’s founder and owner Jen Pelka told Eater NY this year, adding: “But we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” It’s possible, of course, that Pelka has a Silicon Valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. My first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of Champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.',\n",
       "  'Here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “Ask a sommelier for a 100 Club Scorecard to track all of the bottles of Champagne you try,” the document reads. “Those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a Riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” That proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from Starbucks to Sweetgreen, has a rewards program. ',\n",
       "  'But since there’s just a single bottle of Champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club. That all sounds about right for a dining room with a gold-leaf ceiling.',\n",
       "  'The Riddler, by any yardstick, is expensive. Then again, the haute-sparkling-wine stratosphere operates by its own ridiculous value equations. At any ambitious American or Gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of Champagne for less than $30, so the fact that Pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. Among those fizzy wines is a Gonet-Medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit LaCroix.',\n",
       "  'With beverages like this, chef Nikole Morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single Champagne. It’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. But Morsink, formerly at the Modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.',\n",
       "  'Take the king crab. So many restaurants fall back on serving the regal crustacean as is, in its own shell. Morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. The result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.',\n",
       "  'Shrimp cocktail gets a salt-and-pepper treatment, leading to a pile of barely-cooked-through shellfish with a sharp, saline punch. Roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, French. Morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. Think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of Noel Bazin brut rose ($25). ',\n",
       "  'White truffle risotto, at $42, will count for some as an unaffordable extravagance. But in this realm of luxury dining, it’s a heck of a deal when versions of the dish can command $135 or more.

       "  'Caviar is reliable and not too spendy. The large-beaded kaluga variety ($78) sports a soft texture and mild seafaring flavor; discard the chips and creme fraiche, which overwhelm the delicate eggs. Better is the faux dessert roe. Pot de creme arrives in a round tin, affirming the venue’s nouveau-patrician leanings. Crunchy chocolate balls and bitter caramel sit over a layer of salted and sour vanilla creme fraiche. ',\n",

       "  'The history of French-Japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. Most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. Joël Robuchon’s chain of L’Ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. And oodles of modern Japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.',\n",
       "  'But yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. Their cuisines are more codified. That doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. A bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-English names. The same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.',\n",
       "  'What’s particularly clever about Maison Yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. Snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. Baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. Chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; Baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and Franco-style braised artichokes.',\n",

And the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. A Korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an American steakhouse. A pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. And a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. The lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which Baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce Americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest Gallic seafood soups.',\n",

This is not unexpected for a young venue. Cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. Watching a senior yakitori chef (or Uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. They tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.',\n",
       "  'The binchotan station at Yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. Gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. Baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. The sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. The squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss.

       "  'One of New York’s most exciting new dishes originates from the street vendors of Dalat and Ho Chi Minh City. There, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. This bánh tráng nướng, or Vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in Orange County, California, home to one of the country’s biggest Vietnamese populations. But it’s been largely unavailable in New York.',\n",
       "  'That changed with Di An Di, a Greenpoint Vietnamese restaurant from Texas-native Dennis Ngo. When it opened, Ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. ',\n",
       "  'But the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of Vietnam and its American diaspora, debuted something a bit different in December.',\n",
       "  'Ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic Vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. And then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. The crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. The clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. ',\n",
       "  'The chef says the flavor combinations are true to Vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of Northeasterners: a New Haven-style bivalve pie. The menu lists it both as a Vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants Di An Di as a modern Vietnamese-American restaurant. And it’s an excellent one at that.',\n",
       "  'Long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over Chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist Tu Mo had a few smart words about Vietnamese soup. “Don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author Andrea Nguyen. Mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist French rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of Paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.',\n",
       "  'Nearly a century later, Vietnamese spots pepper the Parisian landscape. And even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in New York, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. Few would consider it humble — especially not at Di An Di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than Gallic consommes.',\n",

Patrons of all stripes line up two hours for bánh xèo — a dosa-like turmeric crepe filled with a warming blend of shrimp, pork, and mung beans; the starchy mixture is bland at first, but a quick application of fish sauce brings the component ingredients to life. ',\n",
       "  'Other diners might reserve weeks in advance to gnaw at wonderfully chewy fried pig tails, sticky with tart tamarind chile sauce. They cleanse their palates with icy vodka highballs, redolent of lemongrass and bergamot, while sitting near neon-green lights and hanging plants.',\n",

Di An Di instead fries the birds, letting them crisp up without any batter. The soft meat and golden skin taste like a mathematically engineered bird: poultry to the power of 100. To amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.',\n",
       "  'Bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of Lone Star Vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare New York appearance here. Strands of rice paper, as wide as tagliatelle and as thin as tissue, act as springboard for a tart jolt of pickled papaya and a salty crumble of beef jerky. It is a perfect cold noodle salad.',\n",
       "  'Lucky guests might also encounter a steamed, grilled, and deep-fried short rib. Ngo says the “entire reasoning” for this special, which packs a powerfully earthy beefiness, was to show off an even more flavor-packed product: mắm nêm. He softens the blow of that famous elixir, forged from whole fermented anchovies, with pineapples, chile, and lime juice. Patrons wrap the beef in the lettuce, then dunk it in the mắm nêm, which has a stunning umami-rich pungency that more or less makes it the durian of steak sauces. ',\n",

The tamale-sized rice wrapper folds around a fistful of mint and basil, while a pile of shrimp and squid mimic the flavor intensity of a langoustine. ',\n",
       "  'New York’s modern Vietnamese menus are often quite focused in their soup offerings. Hanoi House offers a riff on leaner Northern phở — little more than broth, stretchy rice noodles, fish sauce, and filet mignon — while Madame Vo reps the lusher and more common version from the South, fragrant with cilantro and accompanied by a plate of basil, jalapenos, and sprouts. ',\n",
       "  'Di An Di, by contrast, acts as an outlier in selling both. Cooks cover the Hanoi phở in scallions, adding a touch of perfume to the intensely beefy broth. And they serve the sweeter Southern version with a plate of basil and sprouts for tearing and infusing. Giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen also puts out an estimable phở ga (chicken), with a clean poultry tang and a resinous hit of rau ram, as well as a strikingly nuanced bún bò huế, a crimson-hued soup heady with beef, shrimp paste, sweet lemongrass, and bouncier, thicker, firmer noodles.',\n",
       "  'Best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. Patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. This ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes Di An Di a Vietnamese analogue of sorts to Ivan Ramen, one of the few Japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. Diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.',\n",
       "  'Ngo says he plans to tweak the Di An Di formula as it matures, perhaps introducing a late-night program — along the lines of Ssäm Bar in its 2006 days, where Tien Ho served some of the best Vietnamese-American fare the city has ever seen. And he’d also like to revisit dessert, which was nixed after an early effort to keep the tables moving. In other words, the chef is ensuring Di An Di can do what virtually any modern American restaurant serving any type of food needs to do to remain relevant: adapt and evolve. ',\n",

Anya Fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. She achieves such nobility through vertical integration; Belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert Temple Grandin. According to a New Yorker feature titled “Can Steak Save the Planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. The grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” The company even holds O magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. ',\n",
       "  'Belcampo’s East Coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into New York’s meat scene. It is not. The restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of Hudson Yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. ',\n",

The late, great, Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. Other West Coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. There are no such wonders at the Hudson Yards Belcampo. This is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. This is shopping food. ',\n",
       "  'The standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. Grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; I recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. Belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. Virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. ',\n",

       "  'Tartare or carpaccio: These are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. The carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. Flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. The meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. As for the tartare, it’s better than Thomas Keller’s more luxe version at nearby TAK Room. Neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. Most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. ',\n",

It belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. Harry Cipriani is the classic example, while TAK, alongside neighboring Estiatorio Milos, are the more modern ones. The a la carte format in this case lets the 1 percent flex their wealth — amid the company of their privileged brethren — without the burden of a four-hour meal or throngs of destination diners seeking culinary enlightenment. It’s just dinner.',\n",
       "  'To be fair: No one expected TAK to be a cheap hangout. Everything about it is grand, or at least faux-grand: its views of the Hudson (for a select few guests; some seats abut service stations), the sumptuous booths, the live piano player, the crudite amuses (food critics get osetra caviar), the semi-stale candied popcorn mignardises, the sheer expanse of the venue. One could literally fit a sushi bar in its foyer and a cruise ship waterslide on its carpeted staircase and it wouldn’t feel any less roomy. ',\n",
       "  'The environs are about right for lobster Thermidor. The kitchen lightens up the heavy classic with a foam, Gruyere-lace bisque, using it to surround a silky (albeit tiny) tail and two powerfully aromatic claws. It’s essentially a large appetizer — quite nice if you have $110 to spare.',\n",
       "  'Thermidor isn’t the only old-school dish that appears; there’s also sauce Perigourdine, avocado Louis, and celery hearts Victor. TAK Room would be well served to offer descriptions, but the only preparation to receive any type of narrative explanation is the strip steak. The large menu blurb, which is more of a sales pitch, describes the Japanese-Angus hybrid as “the best of both worlds,” and as a meal “for two or for one.” It is among the first items a waiter might recommend. The sixteen-ounce entree costs $206 after tax, and tip. ',\n",
       "  'One wishes a steak so rich could come in a portion that’s a quarter of the size — and price. But the goal here is anchoring, ensuring that high-cost dishes make all the other items seem less preposterous by comparison. Perhaps the $30 eggplant Parm doesn’t seem like such a bad deal in this light. Until you sample it. It’s effectively a bland mash of textureless nightshade in a tomb of mozz and sandy breadcrumbs.',\n",
       "  'Oxtail consomme ($32) is the smarter choice. The meat’s natural gelatins cause one’s lips to stick together, while the broth itself is pure black truffle intensity. Dover sole also does what it should, acting as a soft, flaky conduit for capers and lemon. Still, it is little different from any other sole preparation anywhere else in town.',\n",
       "  'When one thinks of TAK Room, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with the Grill in the old Four Seasons space, that atavistic temple to power. The midcentury-minded spot puts quite a few mains in the $100 club. But many of the entrees fall way below that mark. And the Grill casts a wider net on the past, serving up stellar fare that simply isn’t available elsewhere, from Amish ham steaks to pasta with duck organ juices.',\n",
       "  'TAK Room’s interpretation of yesteryear is narrower and more subtle; it doesn’t feel that different from most contemporary bastions of beef. Steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. Tableside Caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or Parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. It is cold lettuce with dressing. The $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. Black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. The texture is sludge.',\n",
       "  'Better is the Wellington for two ($138), a wonderful riff of the classic, nixing bland tenderloin for a mid-rare short rib that’s almost impossibly heady. The beef needs the pastry crust, (spongy) mushroom duxelles, and truffle sauce to keep its powerful aromas in check. Too bad a smaller, more affordable portion isn’t available for less. ',\n",
       "  'There’s something to be said for a whole fish spot saying, “This is how big our turbot is, we only have one left, and we charge by the pound.” Steaks, however, are the product of in-house butchery. A restaurant that wants to charge less can simply use a knife.',\n",
       "  'Keller is making a choice. He’s making a choice to charge more, just as he’s made a choice to build his more affordable and creative full-service concepts elsewhere, concepts such as Ad Hoc and La Calenda, a Oaxacan spot in Napa Valley. It would be a shame if the takeaway for developers was that we need more restaurants like TAK Room, restaurants where the $100 entree is not just a viable but a desirable goal for more owners and operators to pursue. Sure, it works here. It will likely work elsewhere; there are enough bankers to charge ridiculous prices. Keller knows how to issue a premium on wealthy New Yorkers for fancy food. Now it’s time for him to show he can do something ambitious for the rest of us.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Easily $200 per person or more for 3-4 courses. Remember that most mains are a la carte, as is typical in most steakhouses. That means an $85 filet comes with neither sauces ($6-$12) nor sides ($14).',\n",

',\n",

The other evening, it included red amaranth leaves, produce that’s common in traditional Indian cooking and now stylish in the States as an antioxidant. ',\n",
       "  'What’s more, the paneer is house-made, which hasn’t been the case in many NYC Indian restaurants for the last decade or so, when prepackaged paneer became generally available. The problem with the plastic-wrapped paneer is that it’s way more rubbery. Adda’s paneer, on the other hand, is crumbly and fresh, contributing to the best version of saag paneer in the city.',\n",
       "  'The same incredible paneer constitutes a focus of the menu. Have it in chile paneer tikka ($7). Here, a spicy red sauce has been painted on the grilled squares; they tumble onto the plate like paving stones. Less exciting is paneer khurchan, which tosses the fresh cheese with peppers in a tomato sauce that obscures the cheese’s delicate flavor. ',\n",
       "  'While a few Indian restaurants focused on regional cuisines have incorporated pork (prevalent in Goa and Karnataka) and beef (a Keralan favorite) into their menus, Adda sticks with the standards of chicken, lamb, and goat, which pertain in most restaurants here and in India. Lamb is showcased in one special, a hulking ground-meat seekh kebab ($13) that’s an especially good deal if volume of meat is your objective.',\n",

Goat curries, of course, are ubiquitous at Punjabi steam-table restaurants throughout the city, often in stunning renditions. Adda, though, one-ups even the best of them with the junglee maas. The bones are left in, as they should be, and the gravy is at once fiery and pungent. If you love goat, this curry will drive you crazy and leave your tongue burning. Other standards of top steam-table restaurants are produced here in even better renditions too, including a butter chicken so rich it boasts streaks of actual butter on the surface.',\n",

And though meat shines here, vegetarians will find plenty to love on Adda’s bill of fare, including globular lotus-root kofta akin to croquettes that rest in a tomato sauce laced with fenugreek, and a tandoori-cooked cauliflower topped with a layer of Amul, a processed cheese based on cheddar that’s in the same family as Velveeta.

       "  'One of the pleasures of dining at independent restaurants in 2019 is that they feel immune to the corporate takeover of the city, a town where cheap hot dog stands close to make way for chic juice bars. They serve as an escape from the branded experience encroaching upon so many aspects of modern American life: a president who tweets out photos of fast-food buffets; mobile ads tailored so perfectly that people have begun to wonder whether apps are listening in on our conversations.',\n",

The fish is neutral and translucent; it acts as a clean delivery mechanism for salt, greens, and crispy quinoa.',\n",

A restaurant should foster a sense of community. The community defined by Intersect feels like a sterile world dreamed up by a wealthy baby boomer from the suburbs.

       "  'To observe the flattop at Au Cheval, the New York spinoff of Brendan Sodikoff’s Chicago burger palace, is to witness black steel turn pink. The cooks here do not tend to verdant asparagus or springtime ramps; rather, they traffic in flesh, blood, and marrow. Beef patties and pork belly cover the griddle with such density that an intrepid cat could walk across without burning its paws. It is a carpet of meat. An Angus rug that sizzles. These burgers are why otherwise rational humans subject themselves to an inordinately long wait before dinner. ',\n",
       "  'The Tribeca hotspot offers two optional toppings: a fried egg and a layer of pepper bacon — the kind that’s cut so thick it could stand alone as an appetizer. Those add-ons are for those who want, to borrow the words of a waiter, “the Instagram burger.” ',\n",
       "  'I want no such thing. Twenty minutes later, my server sends over the standard model: two seared patties. They boast a handsome maillard char and a midlevel bovine punch. American cheese — or as I like to call it, yellow salt — folds itself into the brown nooks and crannies. This all goes into a golden brioche bun slicked with dijonnaise. It is a tasty burger. Then again, there is no shortage of tasty burgers in New York. That’s worth keeping in mind when a host says it’s going to be 90 minutes before you sit down.',\n",
       "  'Also worth keeping in mind: The signature item runs $27 with fries, placing it firmly within gourmet burger territory. Add the suggested toppings and you’re at $35, which places it alongside the DB burger as one of the city’s priciest. But while Boulud’s truffle- and foie gras-stuffed specimen is a veritable act of expert charcuterie, the Au Cheval burger, with all the fixins, is a gloppy, runny, everything-falls-out-when-you-bite-it expression of American junk food. It’s not quite in the same league as its peers.',\n",

This isn’t a bad pairing, per se, but the eggs are infused with such an obscene amount of butter and salt that the palate craves acidity, be it a zingier cheese or tart oven-roasted tomatoes. Instead, the chevre adds fat and the pepper adds sugar. It is a study in too much.',\n",

Rascasse, with spiny protrusions that look plagiarized from the latest Jurassic Park film.

That can’t be right, you declare, not for this strikingly bland product, heavily undersalted, with just a few paltry capers and no olive oil.

Skewered meats are normally a performative affair, with flames shooting skyward and fat incinerating into a fragrant perfume. But from the vantage point of this marble bar, flanked by rough-hewn wood, diners witness a calmer spectacle. The chefs simply place pierced chicken thighs on a hot flattop and monitor the cooking with care. This is unexpected. ',\n",
       "  'Indonesia, a multi-ethnic archipelago of 6,000 inhabited islands and the world’s most populous Muslim-majority country, doesn’t have a unitary cuisine. Its myriad cultures and dishes express influences ranging from indigenous to Dutch to Middle Eastern to Indian to Polynesian to Chinese. But broadly speaking, hawkers like to grill over wood or coal, a technique that imbues their meats with succulent smoke and char. It’s a style of cooking New York restaurants are increasingly obsessing over, from the Standard’s elegant binchotan to the shashlik trough at Nargis. ',\n",

It’s like blanquette de veau on a stick, albeit energized with coconut and red curry. Pork skewers, showing off a bit more chew, arrive in a chile-soy glaze that’s as inky as mole negro, though markedly sweeter. And sticks of Florida shrimp, exuding the candied scent of makrut lime, collapse with the snap of a summertime watermelon. ',\n",

From his eponymous Central Park flagship to his clubby Spice Market in the Meatpacking District, he drew upon his days cooking in Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong to fuse Asian sensibilities with Continental fare. He flourished dishes with floral herbs like lemongrass while deploying levels of heat, salt, sugar, and acid uncharacteristic for sleepier Midtown venues. The flavors were still in balance; it’s just that they were cranked up to high volume.',\n",
       "  'That style of cooking, which worked its way through the culinary mainstream over the years, is precisely what one encounters at Wayan. Cédric, a Bangkok-born chef who also runs Perry St, places ultra-ripe mango slices on radicchio and drenches them all in passionfruit sauce. You roll up the leaves and then eat them with your hands, the zing and fragrance of the fruits priming the tongue for richer courses to come.',\n",

The broth is rich with beef and cinnamon yet lightened to springtime levels through tactical doses of lemongrass and cilantro. On the side is a small ramekin of pureed green chile and cilantro; patrons mix it in to amp up the levels of salt and heat. Fancy French chefs, of course, are never content to serve braised meats straight out of the pot; they insist on crisping up the edges for a bit of texture. And that’s precisely what Cédric does, imparting the oxtail with a firm Maillard char.',\n",
       "  'Really, if there were any fears about whether Wayan would be good, they weren’t questions of benign adaptation — be it adjusting for local ingredients or sensibilities — but rather of stifling uniformization, the virulent straitjacket of the New York restaurant world. The prevailing Jean-Georges empire, with few exceptions, has been less about taking an imaginative (or traditional) approach to Asian ingredients, and more about throwing together bland East-meets-West menus in a package that can be copied across the globe. ',\n",
       "  'Such fears are not entirely unwarranted. Vong Kitchen in Jakarta, whose dishes are “curated by” Cédric and Jean-Georges, speaks to this narrative, as do certain aspects of the Wayan menu. There’s the sesame-laced amberjack sashimi here in Nolita, which wouldn’t feel out of place at any Nobu or Robuchon in Moscow or Tokyo. There’s the obligatory safe steak, $60 worth of overcooked wagyu that mimics the texture of a well-worn shoe. ',\n",
       "  'And then there’s Wayan’s crabcake, garnished with a vertical build of cucumbers and sprouts as if it were one of Alfred Portale’s “tall” dishes from the 1980s. With so many brilliant Southeast Asian crab dishes (and fish cakes) to choose from, one wonders why Wayan opts for a preparation indistinguishable from the American country club variety. Make no mistake, the kitchen balances the flavors with aplomb, jazzing up the neutral crabmeat with a fiery, fish sauce-laced vinaigrette. But still, it’s disappointing that Cédric, instead of trying to introduce New Yorkers to something decidedly rare, falls back on something so ubiquitous. ',\n",

       "  'More inspirational is the nasi goreng, a must-order. Indonesian meals are often built around rice, and Wayan’s version of the staple is deeply flavorful with the aroma of garlic. Pair it with sauteed whole prawns, slathered in a sweet sambal the color of Twizzlers, or even better, with yellow curry; crispy chicken thighs and wings sit in a pool of turmeric- and lemongrass-infused coconut milk.

       "  '“It would be great if you could settle up,” she says. How welcoming.',\n",
       "  'Ten minutes later, a waiter ferries over a tray filled with guacamole, tacos, ramen, and other fusiony fare that wouldn’t feel out of place at a clubstaurant like Tao or Vandal. That reality extends to the cocktail list. Anyone who orders the house mule, a watery mix of Grey Goose, turmeric, ginger, and lavender, will have to ask for an “Ayurvedic Jackass.” ',\n",
       "  'It’s all enough to make one wonder: Is it not odd that chef Gurpreet Singh, whose eye for nuance made Indian Accent one of the city’s more exhilarating fine dining experiences, is channeling the ubiquities (and ignominies) of the modern food world? It is odd — until you start eating.',\n",
       "  'Guacamole, at first glance, is indistinguishable from other excellent versions elsewhere. Cooks mash the avocados to order with green chiles and cilantro — nothing out of the ordinary. ',\n",
       "  'But a few subtle tweaks make the dish stand out. Cooks lace the fruit with cumin; its sweet musk wafts along the palate. And instead of fried tortillas, GupShup uses khakhra crisps: thin, fried, fenugreek-laced flatbread from Gujarat. And while the supply of chips is only sufficient for about 60 seconds’ worth of guac eating (lolz), an order of garlic naan finishes the job with efficiency. It’s a pricey ’mole at $18, or $24 with bread, but the clear flavors and soft, meringue-like textures are flawless.',\n",
       "  'For “tacos,” Singh wraps a mash of jackfruit inside chilla pancakes. The soft shell, made from lentil flour, has the springy give of injera, while the fruit, sporting the texture of firm tofu, yields to a gentle chew. It conveys meatiness without meat, singes the tongue with chiles, and finishes with the perfume of lime. You continue eating, and you slowly realize why folks are flocking to this packed patch of Gramercy.',\n",
       "  'The dining room and the jackfruit tacos',\n",
       "  'There are at least two branches to the ongoing evolution of Indian fare in New York. One of them, which includes venues like Chintan Pandya’s Adda and Hemant Mathur’s Sahib, espouses forward-looking classics and less-commonly found regional dishes — from Kashmiri methi maaz (lamb in fenugreek sauce) to bheja fry (eggy goat-brain stews). These venues function to remind New Yorkers that South Asian food isn’t a static monolith but an ever-changing collection of distinct (and overlapping) cuisines.',\n",
       "  'Singh’s restaurant does not belong to that group, not with its lamb seekh burgers, masala fries, and cod sliders. Its gastronomic leanings align with a different gang, a league of South Asian spots that add a layer of internationalism and creativity to more traditional dishes. One thinks of the yuzu-laced chile crabs of Rahi in Greenwich Village or the foie gras duck haleem of Baar Baar, a frenetic Bowery space with a Buddakan-style vibe.',\n",
       "  'GupShup, by Indian-born restaurateur Jimmy Rizvi (Korali Estiatorio), is a more sedate affair. It finds its energy in art — from a two-story wall of 3,000 tiffins to artist Karishma Naran’s mural of a modern Indian woman — and in a style of culinary tinkering that’s more trend-centric than its peers.',\n",
       "  'That means Saturday morning avocado toast. The line between innovative globalism and yet another a basic brunch staple can be a fine one, and in this particular instance, it’s not so clear whether Singh adds anything to the conversation. The chef smears a bland swath of the fruit over cold, limp sourdough, adds some diced mango and chopped onion, and charges $18. It would not pass muster at a free hotel breakfast buffet. ',\n",
       "  'GupShup’s ramen is another misstep. That’s not to slight the ideas underpinning it; adding noodles to a Southern tomato curry is intuitive enough. It’s the execution that’s flawed. The ramen itself was overcooked to the point of mushiness, and a supplemental lobster tail had the texture of jerky.',\n",
       "  'Those mistakes aside, Singh generally manages to execute his more experimental dishes with aplomb. There’s that guac and those jackfruit tacos. Or take the puchkas, crispy puffs filled with smoked salmon and curd rice mousse. Ad absurdum, the city’s dining scene would be a very weird place if every new restaurant sold yet another riff on cream cheese and lox on a bagel. ',\n",
       "  'But just as Momofuku Bang Bar manages to improve upon the classic combo with warm flatbread, GupShup’s own evocation, blending Indian sensibilities with Jewish-appetizing inclinations, is no less relevant. The puchkas crumble with just a flick of the tongue. The tart mousse vibrates on the tongue with the power of Alka Seltzer, acting as a stunning antidote to the oily fish.',\n",
       "  'Or consider the chur-chur naan, a soft yet flaky bread that’s a popular street snack in Delhi. Vendors typically finish it off with butter. Singh adds foie gras, an ingredient that historically functions as an extreme act of indulgence. But somehow the engorged duck liver is a seamless addition to the dish, dialing up the naan’s richness and sweetness. ',\n",
       "  'Sliders, the mini-sandwich bane of the aughts, make a winning return here as softly baked cod atop pao rolls. If the salinity of the fish is too much at first, make sure to chomp the bread, whose sugars moderate the aggressive seasoning. ',\n",
       "  'Singh, in short, is taking advantage of New York’s thriving globalism to riff on his ancestral cuisine. And if any of this seems a touch off, kindly remember that GupShup is simply deploying the same whimsical eclecticism as its non-Indian peers, from the American restaurant serving Southeast Asian shrimp toast to the Spanish-leaning seafood spot selling Sichuan-style pig ear to virtually any sports bar anywhere in the city hawking tacos.',\n",
       "  'Singh could surely thrive on his creativity alone, but he also rocks the classics with finesse. The kitchen sends out chicken tikka with an interior so creamy it could pass itself off as tofu. Tiger prawns, in turn, exhibit delicately cooked flesh and an oceanic aroma that recalls more-expensive langoustines.',\n",
       "  'Singh used to make a mean vegetarian keema back at Indian accent; it was a spicy, saucy, umami-rich stew of soy that effectively made it one of the city’s top cups of chili. Here at GupShup, he keeps things meatier, setting a coarse grind of lamb in two halves of an onion. It uses the power of cinnamon to amp up the grassy sweetness of the ruminant.',\n",
       "  'Beef stir-fry, the legendary streetside dish of Kerala, doesn’t show up at a lot of New York restaurants. Maybe that will change after more folks try GupShup’s knockout version, with the tender skirt steak bursting with notes of sweet red pepper, curry leaf, onion, and sambal chile. Nizams haleem, a staple of Ramadan iftar dinners in Hyderabad, makes a unexpected appearance as well. The humble dish is everything it should be: lamb, lentils, and wheat cooked down to the texture of a soft paste, all the better for snatching up with naan or rice. ',\n",
       "  'Too bad an order of rice was cold by the time the haleem arrived. It came out, for no particular reason, with an earlier course that included ramen, tacos, and guacamole. Maybe GupShup should ask itself whether it really pairs with any of those dishes? ',\n",
       "  'Weird things tend to happen here. The host might send you to the upstairs bar, whose bartender will then inform you that his section is closed. When someone orders chai ($15 per kettle), a server might respond that they’re not serving it anymore because “our pastry chef has left.” The complexities of the saffron-laced preparation notwithstanding, a restaurant is in trouble if just a single employee is capable of making its signature tea.',\n",
       "  'Pre-made desserts, however, are still available if the pastry chef is absent, though it’s not clear whether that’s a good thing. Fig and banana sticky pudding is a study in bland flavors and cold, mealy textures. Cinnamon panna cotta, on two occasions, tastes like what would happen if a kitchen worker thought that the traditional Italian dessert was supposed to flaunt the texture and sweetness of grocery-store cake frosting. ',\n",
       "  'For a Gramercy Park restaurant with operators as experienced as this, one could reasonably expect more polish; the service missteps tend to distract from the food. And that’s too bad, because Singh’s cuisine represents a thrilling chapter in modern New York Indian cuisine.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Starters at $10 to $24; larger dishes at $24 to $46; desserts at $10. Ramen appetizer is $16, or $34 with a lobster tail. Naan is $5-$7; cocktails are $16; chai is $15.',\n",

It claims to provide “wellness and nutrition” through “clean, conscious cuisine” — you know, earthy spelt toast, breezy Brazil nut chia bowls, and, um, Pop Rocks. The venue speaks to a “high performance lifestyle,” per its own Instagram of a trainer’s chiseled tricep. Another photo, depicting a sculpted lower back, recommends a flax seed and sweet potato bowl following a few sets of reverse squats. This is, to be fair, all what one might expect at Hudson Yards’s Equinox Hotel, a self-proclaimed “temple to total regeneration” with a 60,000-square-foot gym.',\n",

Those who look past the GOOP-y branding and weekend DJs will find one of the most enjoyable places to eat on the far west side. At least at dinner, dietary considerations seem to integrate themselves rather invisibly into the smart, precise Mid-Atlantic fare. ',\n",

       "  'It is difficult to consider Hudson Yards without understanding its larger missteps, particularly the fact that the entire compound functions as a taxpayer-subsidized bastion for the rich. But one shouldn’t forget a smaller failure that plagues so much about dining here, which is that almost almost every restaurant overlooks the mall, or worse, the glistening selfie machine that is the Vessel. Electric Lemon lucks out in this regard, with floor-to-ceiling windows showing off Midtown’s dynamically evolving skyline. ',\n",
       "  'Here’s what one can see from an outdoor table: the quartz-like geometry of the Bank of America building, the New Yorker hotel sign glowing neon red, a glass-encased fireplace blazing next to a long rectangular pool, the Hudson River, and the sun setting over the Jersey City Heights. Here’s what one can’t see: the shawarma-shaped Vessel, unless you’re pressed up against a bar window indoors.',\n",
       "  'Even as the weather turns cooler, outside is the ideal setting for a meal. Try kicking things off with a ramekin of razor clams. Chef Kyle Knall (Maysville) tames the brine with a pungent pickled carrot and cilantro broth. As the wind picks up, a staffer swings by with blankets to counteract the cold. This is the time to warm up with roasted oysters. Knall gently smokes the bivalves in their shells, infusing them with the sweet scent of hay. A touch of shallot mignonette tames the brine. For more even more tang, green tomato carpaccio has enough acidity to act as an edible defibrillator, letting buttermilk dressing impart powerful levels of pucker to the paper thin, umami-rich fruit.',\n",
       "  'But for a truly chilly night, consider the duck dumplings, which do their best stateside take on tortellini en brodo. Knall wouldn’t be faulted for simply dropping these extra al dente ravioli, filled with rich avian fowl, into a hot bowl of bone broth. But he smartly strives for balance, adding diced apples for tartness and lemon verbena for perfume.',\n",
       "  'Much of the menu is gluten-free, including a flatbread pizza — textureless bread, bland broccoli, insipid cheese — that tastes cribbed from a hot buffet in a suburban mall. Chickpea tagliatelle, however, manages to mimic the snappy texture of semolina-based pasta with finesse; the strands sop up a light tomato-shishito sauce that’s as floral as it is piquant. Equally airy is the grilled bass, slicked with green salsa verde and topped with a salad’s worth of nasturtium, mint, and other fresh herbs. The flesh is springy; the garnishes are bright, and the tortillas that come with are warm. It all makes for stellar DIY tacos.',\n",
       "  'If the the beet-yogurt “Beauty Bowls” at brunch fall in line with trends at self-described “lifestyle” restaurants, the nighttime dishes could pass themselves off as the New American style that has trended lighter and brighter for quite some time. For example: Knall roasts his lamb loin rare, fortifying it with little more than a simple reduction of its own juices. It’s not a study in butter or lard, but rather in the grassy slap of the lean meat and the musk of cumin; only a few cubes of braised shoulder impart a hint of rich fat. ',\n",
       "  'Labeling any of this as “wellness” fare might be important by Equinox’s aspirational marketing logic. Still, that language feels a bit dicier by standards of common sense. Clean eating, as a term, has been used to broadly suggest unproven health benefits, or as code for non-Western dishes that have been scrubbed of perceived impurities. It’s curious how, at Electric Lemon, a marbled steak gets to be a steak, and a fatty burger gets to be a burger, but the banh mi, unavailable elsewhere in Hudson Yards, is stripped of its signature pate or cold cuts (or heck, tofu) and replaced with bland roast carrots. Also: When a restaurant posts a photo of someone holding a cocktail while their cephalic vein bursts out of their forearm, that effectively signals the type of bodies that belong here, and those that don’t.',\n",

Next to them, she places frozen spheres of lemon curd. She arranges this all in such a way that channels a faraway solar system, where the orbital bodies are made of sugar and colored in pastels. The sorbet is soft and fragrant; the curd is firm and bracingly sour; and the Pop Rocks, more audible than visible, vibrate across the tongue like a soft electric current. ',\n",

At Masa, I watched a party of four wolf down $700 worth of wagyu in a minute. “You’ll be able to pay for a year’s worth of flights with the points from this meal,” one of them said to the man stuck with the check. At Ichimura, I saw a group of tourists ignore the fragile nigiri the chef was serving them, letting two or more pieces collect on their plates as they tapped away on their phones. And at Zo, two guys sitting nearby insisted on taking care of our $650 bill. After they did (thank you!), they encouraged us to defraud our company by expensing the dinner anyway. ',\n",

A few minutes later, as I was contemplating a nori-wrapped scallop, the shellfish sugars juxtaposed against the coastal-breeze tautness of the seaweed, that same guy exclaimed, “Wow, they nailed that.” He went on with these audible platitudes throughout the meal, in the vein of a sports fan yelling athletic gobbledygook at the nearest flat-screen television.

The cephalopod gives a bit of resistance at first, like an MSG-laced gourmet rubber band, then quickly tenderizes, flaunting a starchy creaminess.

An Asian rotisserie in Midtown stuffs its breakfast pitas with, of all things, cream cheese and lox.

       "  'Chef-owner Jenny Kwak infuses gochuchang chile powder into a classic French soup of fish fumet, fennel, tomatoes, and Pernod. The rust-colored mixture zings your sinuses with a pungent tang of the sea. A filet of cod acts as a steady conduit for the powerful broth, as does a scattering of — not something you’d find in Marseille — glutinous rice cakes. Mussels add a touch of funk, as do head-on shrimp and all their oozy insides. And then there’s the prize, an orb of uni floating about like an egg yolk in ramen.

That country’s cuisine didn’t have a ton of East Village representation there before Kwak and her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, came along nearly 30 years ago. The duo have functioned among a group of trailblazers for the city’s Korean scene, spreading the gospel of their ancestral foods outside the confines of 32nd Street. The mother-daughter team opened up Dok Suni’s on First Avenue in the early 1990s, drawing in hip crowds with stretchy japchae noodles.',\n",

Pull them up with a pair of chopsticks, collecting the other ingredients along the way — perhaps some jalapeños, or crumbled chorizo peeking just beneath the surface.

       "  'Montesacro Pinseria is a serious Roman restaurant masquerading as a pizzeria. The pizza, of course, is the almost faddish pinsa, an oblong flop of well-browned dough made from a combination of wheat, rice, and soy flour, tracing its roots back to ancient Rome. Part of a mini chain that includes another branch in Portland, the restaurant was founded in San Francisco in 2015, and claims to be the first pinseria in the United States.',\n",
       "  'Our branch — run by owner Gianluca Legrottaglie, chef Riccardo Buitoni, and wine director Emanuele Tibaldo — lies in central Williamsburg, just above the Lorimer L stop on Union Avenue. If the place seems eerily familiar, that’s because it was the former and much-missed bistro DuMont. Now, the front room is quiet and serene, with a bar running along one side and an open kitchen at the end of the room, so open you can reach in and grab a loaf of freshly made bread, warm, moist, and with a dense crumb.',\n",
       "  'But a crooked hallway runs around the kitchen to the place most diners settle down: the covered rear patio. With a black interior and bright spotlights, it feels like an airport runway at midnight. The patio seats 70 or so, and potted plants are scattered here and there. Big tables can be easily pushed together into bigger tables, where groups seeking post-work pizza hunker down, with huzzahs rising up to the retractable ceiling.',\n",
       "  'Let’s ignore the pinsa for a minute. Romans are very fond of variety meats, and evidence of this is a marvelous pig head roulade ($11), composed of smoky and greasy swirls of white fat and pink flesh. There’s also a tripe dish, Roman-style in a cheesy tomato sauce. What’s the difference between it and the famed tripe of Florence? Well, Roman tripe is further seasoned with fresh mint, an herb often seen in Roman cooking. You’ll be seeing more of it at Montesacro.',\n",
       "  'Unless incorporated onto a pinsa, vegetables ($13 to $16) will not be the most memorable aspect of your meal. Most are grilled or shaved raw — stiff artichokes with stripes of char; fractal Romanesco, also undercooked; and Brussels sprouts shaved like a monk’s tonsure. The notable exception to the meh vegetables is delicata squash. It gets crumbed like tempura, making the mellow orange vegetable crunchy and soft at the same time, and then dribbled with honey and heaped with grated cheese. Get three orders and it could happily be your entire meal.',\n",
       "  'Pastas play an important, if minor, role on the bill of fare, and all I’ve tasted have been unfailingly excellent. Closely associated with Rome, egg-yolky carbonara ($18) shines yellow in its bowl, dotted with cured guanciale in little salty tidbits and poured over mezze maniche, stunted tubules that trap more sauce than the spaghetti traditionally used. The effect is like breakfast bacon and eggs.',\n",
       "  'But make sure you examine the easy-to-miss special menu, which flaps on a tiny slip of paper stapled to the regular one. Special pastas have included potato gnocchi, soft as a winter mitten, mired in a fibrous beef cheek sauce that clings in great globs to the pasta, and burrata-filled ravioli lavished with fresh chanterelles and grated truffle pecorino. At $20 for a substantial serving, how can the restaurant afford to offer it?',\n",
       "  'The five-item list of specials that day was particularly compelling due to its component of fresh mushrooms, served at just the season when they’re harvested in Italy. This is meta-restaurateuring at its best, meaning certain indefinable features besides the food will transport you to Rome. There was also a wild boar chop in a ragu of fresh porcinis, and a pinsa that featured Italian sausage and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. A friend and I ordered all three mushroom specials that evening and enjoyed a fungal orgy.',\n",
       "  'There are only three proper secondi: a fish, a steak, and a chicken. The waiter warned us away from the steak, which comes in a salsa verde more appropriate to Florentine cooking. You might choose the crisp-skinned chicken pressed under a brick instead, but conventional entrees here will never be the highlight of your meal.',\n",
       "  'Inevitably, we come to the pinsas. The variety is vast, and the individual diner will pick the pizza with the combination of ingredients that pleases her most. I can see digging the one with broccoli rabe and spicy sausage (Maranella, $20), or the pie that sports tomatoes, fried eggplant, and two kinds of cheese, including the unmeltable ricotta salata (Portonaccio, $19).',\n",
       "  'I selected instead a pinsa that’s assembled after the pie comes out of the oven, making the toppings warm but not hot. You won’t burn your tongue out of eagerness on the Garbatella ($21), which features wads of really great albacore tuna, purple onions, and caper mayonnaise. Yes, it tastes like the world’s best tuna salad sandwich. Another favorite outlier merits a special box by itself on the menu — focaccia der muratore, wherein a thin layer of pinsa dough sheaths slices of mortadella. For bologna lovers, this is pig heaven.',\n",
       "  'Besides pizzeria and Roman restaurant, Montesacro enjoys a further identity as a wine bar. The list has many diverting specimens that would go well with pizza. Unfortunately, many tend to be a little pricey for this usage, including a nero d’Avola and an Etna rosso from Sicily ($60 and $70, respectively), reds with a flinty taste issuing from volcanic soils. Other wines come from Spain, France, Turkey, Slovenia, and Chile, but the one that drinks best with pizza, to my taste, is a fizzy and almost sweet red lambrusco ($48) from the Emilia-Romagna producer Vecchia Modena.',\n",
       "  'On the other hand, you should never be ashamed of eating your pinsa the way Romans often do, with that venerable Roman beverage, Coca-Cola. Only in this case, it will be a bottle of Mexican Coke.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Dinner for two, including one appetizer, one pinsa, and one pasta, plus two glasses of wine and tax but not tip, $90. ',\n",

       "  'Not too long into dinner at Red Paper Clip, an Asian-leaning tasting-menu spot in the West Village, a server brings over an ash-colored plate decorated with white swirls of yogurt and scattered herbs. “Carrot katsu,” he says. This is unusual, not just because this breadcrumb-enriched cutlet is typically made with pork or chicken, but rather because this style of Japanese cooking isn’t frequently seen at a bastion of expensive eating — unless it involves a fat slab of luxurious wagyu. ',\n",
       "  'The katsu packs a deeper, denser crunch than a more cloud-like piece of tempura. The exterior, however, quickly yields to a softer orange interior, at once vaguely sweet and savory. Those swirls of yogurt, in turn, add a soothing tang, while shiso oil conveys a minty, licorice-tinged perfume. ',\n",
       "  'On a good night, it easily ranks as one of the better katsu dishes in a town, and it shows that a more rustic Japanese dish like this one is just as deserving of a place on a tasting menu as a slice of blow-torched tuna neck. On a bad night, however, the carrots are undercooked and cloying. The aroma of the shiso is flat. And the conversation ends there, a disappointing conclusion to an exciting idea. ',\n",
       "  '“These are black truffles from Oregon,” a waiter announces a few minutes later, shaving them over something dubbed xiaolongbao agnolotti. It’s a cross between the Italian stuffed pasta, not an uncommon player on long, fancy menus, and the Shanghainese soup dumpling, which is seen less frequently at more formal, prix fixe establishments. You pop one of the sachets into your mouth and wait for the magic to happen. It never does — more on why in a bit — but it still tastes pretty good. ',\n",
       "  'And at $95 for the tasting, the price isn’t too shabby either.',\n",
       "  'The two-month-old Red Paper Clip, an uneven solo debut from Kevin Chen and Tashi Gyamtso, lies at the center of a few different narratives. One is about a duo of Blue Hill at Stone Barns alums charging a very fair price for a six-course menu. As sushi temples priced for oligarchs continue to open up around the city unabated, and as diners flock toward chophouses where the price of a single main course can hit the triple digits, fewer restaurateurs have been willing to give it a go at the sub-$100 level. ',\n",
       "  'Contra has long been the champion of the “budget” tasting menu, while Luthun in the West Village and Reverence in Harlem represent newer entrants to the field. And while $95 is far from cheap by any yardstick, diners seem to be responding well to Red Paper Clip, with quoted wait times at the bar area sometimes exceeding 90 minutes. The people want their salt-and-pepper lobster.',\n",
       "  'The presence of that dish and others brings up another narrative, which is that these two chefs are dedicating noteworthy tasting-menu real estate to the diverse foodways of China. Chen, a native New Yorker of Taiwanese descent, and Gyamtso, who was raised in Tibet, have put together a dinner that weaves Cantonese, Shanghainese, and Himalayan ingredients with those from France, Italy, Japan, and elsewhere. That’s no small matter. While a new class of hip restaurateurs are showing off the multitudinous culinary traditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the mainland, Chinese fare doesn’t benefit from as much representation as Korean or kaiseki cuisine at tasting menu venues.',\n",
       "  'A waiter shaves black truffles over XLB agnolotti.',\n",
       "  'Tasting menus, of course, do not possess a monopoly on splurge-worthy dining; there is no rule dictating that a particular cuisine needs a long prix fixe to evolve or accrue legitimacy.',\n",
       "  'But the format, when deployed smartly, has its benefits. A restaurant serving 15 courses has more room to push the envelope, while an appetizer-entree-dessert venue has to sate more conservatively and quickly. And inasmuch as these longer menus remain popular — and since there’s a perception among some that Chinese flavors can’t merit the same prices as their Western (or Japanese) counterparts — it’s righteous to see Chen and Gyamtso prove folks wrong.',\n",
       "  'There are, to be fair, other operators in this sphere. Corey Lee’s Benu in San Francisco rose to fame on lobster coral xiaolongbao and faux shark’s fin soup, while Kato in Los Angeles developed a following serving omakases replete with three-cup octopus and other Taiwanese delicacies. But in New York, an expression of Chinese fare at a prix fixe spot frequently means a nominal curtsy — a bit of XO sauce here, a dab of indiscernible Sichuan peppercorn there — rather than a deeper conversation with the country’s cuisine.',\n",
       "  'It’s for this reason that one might scoff at Red Paper Clip’s Sichuan peppercorn beef carpaccio, a dish on the a la carte bar menu. A sheath of crimson ribeye, no heavier than a ball of cotton, covers most of a white plate. Then you take a few bites and the scope of the preparation begins to expand. Slices of tendon express themselves in the form of a salty, chicharron-like puffs, while cilantro adds the type of fragrant aroma one might expect from one of the province’s beef dishes. And finally, that ubiquitous peppercorn zings the palate, not by numbing it into submission — a feeling that’s occasionally quite nice — but rather by imparting a round and complex bitterness. Visually, the dish wouldn’t look out of place at an Estela or a Wildair, but its DNA feels Sichuan through and through.',\n",
       "  'Then during a later visit, the same dish lacks any of the pepper’s profound nuances, or the cilantro’s assertive grassiness. It’s just another carpaccio.',\n",
       "  'Here’s simplicity at its best: Chen and Gyamtso coat a tangle of nori fettuccine in mushroom butter. This infuses the noodles with a rich, earthy flavor that recalls the verdant roundness of good matcha. Things are quite lovely. Until they’re not. During another visit, the first course, a tiny amuse of two oysters — one cool and the other plump and warm — takes 30 minutes to arrive.',\n",
       "  'Therein lies the the final storyline of the restaurant, which adopted the tasting-menu format in the dining room at the beginning of September. Underlying all this (relative) affordability is a tougher reality, which is that Chen and Gyamtso’s gastronomic reach sometimes exceeds their grasp. Red Paper Clip can fail in the conception or execution of key dishes — or in the pacing of the meal — in such a way that suggests this place isn’t ready to command the time or prices it does. ',\n",
       "  'Or consider the lobster three ways. There’s rice cooked down with lobster bodies, which, aside from a few nuggets of meat, doesn’t really show off the deep flavor of the shellfish as it should. The butter-poached tail, while pleasantly oceanic, sports the texture of something left in the pot too long. And the fried claw, a take on the classic “salt and pepper” preparation, has no pepper flavor. Mostly, everything tastes good — particularly the claw, which packs all sorts of sweet essence of the sea — but it’s clear that the food isn’t living up to its own intellectual promise.',\n",
       "  'That criticism applies to the xiaolongbao agnolotti as well. They have no al dente snap; the noodle is largely limp and sometimes filled with just an inkling of porky soup. Occasionally that broth, which lacks the lip-smacking fattiness that makes a xiaolongbao so compelling, suffers from a lukewarm temperature. An act of fusion doesn’t need to mirror the dishes that inspire it; if that were the case, there’d never be any culinary progress. But it’s hard not to shed a tear when fine dining takes an everyday masterpiece and flattens it into something boring and expensive. ',\n",
       "  'The late-summer tasting finishes off its savory courses with a few slices of tender, slow-smoked short rib, and then the meal comes to a somewhat abrupt end with a single dessert. The kitchen arranges dollops of rum bavaroise (thick whipped cream), chocolate mousse, a bit of chocolate cake, and miso caramel around a plate, topping off the affair with a thin dark-chocolate crunch. These “spreads” range from fluffy to sweet to, in the case of the miso, remarkably salty. Whimsical moments like these suggest that Red Paper Clip will eventually find its groove. For now, though, it’s a restaurant filled with ideas that don’t quite land on the plate.',\n",

That style of cooking is called Nikkei, a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese sensibilities that’s deeply ingrained into the South American country’s culinary ethos. Scores of Japanese people emigrated to Peru starting in the late 19th century, often as exploited indentured servants, thousands of whom were persecuted and deported to U.S. internment camps during World War II.',\n",

He pairs fried Iberico pork loin — at once crisp, nutty, and hammy — with a ropy pile of pesto-tinged udon. And he matches scallops with a pool of cherimoya, an Andean fruit that channels coconut as much as it does lychee. The mollusks sport the taste of tangy fruit before giving way to their own sweet, coastal flavor.',\n",

He takes soft, heady chicken thigh and wraps a layer of seaweed and rice around it, sprinkling the cylinder with toasted sesame seeds. Tableside, a waiter drenches the entire dish in a silky, chile-spiked walnut sauce, transforming it into a high-wire aji de gallina, or spicy creamed chicken. The combination of poultry, dairy, and spice — thanks to aji amarillo peppers — is as avant-garde as it is nourishing.',\n",

The chefs roast a two-pound lobster, rip out its meat, drizzle it with about three pounds of garlic butter, and garnish it with fries for dunking. It tastes the way a good lobster should: like a sweetened version of the Atlantic ocean.',\n",

       "  'The sale of foie gras — a fatty indulgence that punches you in the gut, steals your money, and tries to make you feel good about that transaction — will soon be illegal in New York City. Most restaurants, however, won’t have to do much to comply. Force-fed duck livers don’t enjoy as much popularity among young culinarians, a class of hospitality types that turns to nimbler luxuries like uni, abalone, and truffles. In fact, simply encountering foie on a new restaurant menu is somewhat rare.',\n",
       "  'Gotham Bar & Grill is an uncommon establishment in this regard. Foie takes center stage at the famed American venue. This is all the more surprising given that the Greenwich Village fixture, for the first time in 34 years, boasts an ambitious new chef: Victoria Blamey, who takes over from Alfred Portale. ',\n",
       "  'Blamey lets foie show off its sweet side, juxtaposing it against saltier, chewier ham hock. For a more savory affair, she glazes the product with a layer of truffled seaweed gelee, imparting the stomach-distending, main course-sized appetizer with bass notes of earthiness. And in a third dish, she lets foie take the airier form of foam over poussin. It’s a fine ode to 1996, when Gotham paired this delicacy with guinea hen or squab, or to 2013, when the restaurant featured a trio of simultaneous foie preparations as well.',\n",
       "  'Excess is the point of this extravagance, and Blamey prepares it well. But as a legacy restaurant looks toward the future, perhaps a wallet-busting old-school indulgence shouldn’t occupy so much real estate on a tight bill of fare. And while the poussin-foie is now gone, there’s still something retro about the larger framework of the venue, a contemporary Greenmarket restaurant serving two big steaks and two types of caviar while offering just a single vegetarian main.',\n",
       "  '“In a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, Gotham Bar and Grill is an outlier,” wrote New York Times critic Sam Sifton in 2011. It was, in his words, a restaurant that celebrated “stability and excellence.” And while the owners in 2019 decided to seek change — a claim backed up by hiring Blamey — Sifton’s assessment still largely holds true.',\n",
       "  'Portale, in his early reign, ranked among the most influential and envelope-pushing New American chefs. In the mid-’80s, he acted as an early champion of seasonal, local fare. And more famously, he built dishes vertically, constructing seafood salads as if they were edible Marie Antoinette wigs. But even as Gotham trended more internationalist in the 21st century, its influence waned amid the brash, stripped-down small-plates era of the aughts and beyond.',\n",
       "  'The acquisition of a younger chef, who built a reputation for whimsical and inventive tavern fare at Chumley’s, could have been an opportunity for a full reset. But notwithstanding a touch of high acid here, a bit of Maine uni there, and smart smattering of chiles everywhere, it’s not clear this is truly Blamey’s establishment. Gotham very much remains Gotham, minus any long-faded excellence.',\n",

Morgan’s private wealth management division.',\n",
       "  'On the way to your table, you pass under puffy fabric chandeliers, past a party of five guys (each of them wearing blue-collared button-downs), past three gray-haired men in suits (two of them order the foie), and up and down a few stairs. A waiter is quick to mention they are sold out of the $90 caviar, and can only offer the $140 version.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes the food feels in sync with both new and old gastronomy. The kitchen laces beef tartare with confit tomato, showers it with fluffy gran queso, and tops it off with a wavy tendon chicharon. The layering recalls the altitude of Portale’s architectural tuna tartare, but in a way that’s distinctly, well, Blamey. ',\n",
       "  'But on those rare occasions when the menu feels loose and modern, the service takes a strange and stodgy turn. If a party of three has one man and two women, should a host really ask: “Will the gentleman sit in the middle?” Should servers say things like, “I’ll bring a cocktail list for the lady?” Should a waiter really ask me, the only male at the table, about whether to clear the wine list after a female companion does all the ordering? Should he make eye contact only with me when asking to clear a course? Does Gotham require that certain staffers follow Robert’s Rules of Order (1876) in addressing guests by the third person? If so, Ryan Sutton doesn’t like it.',\n",

Gotham instead sends out dishes that can feel like obligatory concessions to those with dietary restrictions. Beet kimchi ribbons, tomato, and trout roe sit over a pile of stracciatella doing a bland impression of cream cheese. The result is a preparation that tastes like a failed take on a 1980s chevre and beet salad. ',\n",

The dish is simply a bland, mushy mess (though on another visit, it boasts a more complex roundness and tang). Pea dal, in turn, sit in a rich bath of coconut milk and curry leaf oil. It’s a preparation that begs for naan or rice — or really anything to placate the grainy wallop. At Gotham, it comes with nothing. It is simply a thick, gritty, unbalanced stew of legumes, an incomplete side dish posing as a composed appetizer.',\n",
       "  'The good news, however, is that the sole vegetarian entree showcases Blamey at her best. She chars Caraflex cabbage, drenches it in brown butter, pairs it with a seaweed gremolata, and throws everything over firm beads of fregola pasta. The dish is a striking blend of starch, smoke, restrained fat, and buzzing savoriness.',\n",

Madai (sea bream) expresses itself as a run-of-the-mill, “here’s a clunky slab of overcooked fish” over a zingy green tomato and poblano sauce. Better is slow-cooked lamb shoulder. It shows off the animal’s agrarian musk with greater degree than most fancy spots, while a calabrian chile sauce lights the palate ablaze. It would be a perfect four-bite starter. As a more Herculean main, though, it feels burdensome.',\n",

       "  'At the bar, a shorter collection of dishes shows off the calculated risk-taking that Blamey was renowned for at Chumley’s. Her spreadable boar rillette packs equal parts funk and heat; it is like an American answer to ’nduja. She stuffs smoked sturgeon into little “everything” eclairs for an haute hat tip to Ashkenazi appetizing traditions (currently off the menu). She douses raw scallops in citrus and granada chile, resulting in what might be the city’s most wonderfully pungent and peppery ceviche. ',\n",
       "  'The true showstopper is the crab galette, a riff on the traditional chupe stew of Chile, Blamey’s native country. A puffy disc of pastry yields to a thick layer of pulled Dungeness meat. The flesh is laced with chartreuse, tomato, and chile. While an ordinary crabcake often feels lethargic on the palate, her pie hums with acid, spice, and the rich taste of the sea. On a good night, at least. A repeat sampling resulted in more muted flavors.',\n",
       "  'For dessert, consider the souffle. No denser than soft meringue, it shows off a whiff of perfumed peach, checked by the farmer’s funk of tart sheep’s-milk yogurt ice cream. A tarte tatin for two does everything that’s expected of it, employing soft, flaky, buttery pastry as a conveyance mechanism for bouncy, caramelized, autumnally aromatic apples. ',\n",
       "  'But pain perdu, alas, functions as a pedestrian elevation of the classic French toast dish, albeit for $15.

There’s that purplish exterior, like a crisp baguette with suction cups; the middle layer of gelatin, ever-so squishy; and the meaty interior, firm and juicy.

Getting ahold of a waiter to order one (or a cocktail) sometimes means eating through half a $100 entree, sans beverage. But the wine bar downstairs offers at least 30 whites (and 37 reds) by the glass, with the bulk below $15; a few hover just below $10. Every selection is Greek, a bonus in a city where Hellenic wines don’t get the representation that they deserve.',\n",

The mural is a continuation of his video animation series “New Classics of Mountains and Seas,” which depicts stylized skyscrapers and pagodas poking through the clouds as birds symbolizing airplanes waft by.

The specimen is a buffalo carp, and more of the collar than usual is generously included, so diners don’t have to poke at the eyes and pull swatches of skin away from the cheeks to reveal some of the sweetest reservoirs of flesh.

The small cubes of meat are braised in a pepper broth, then tiny fried wontons filled with beef are tossed in at the last moment as a bonus.

       "  'Six restaurants in India Square specialize in biryani, while many of the other 25 or so dining establishments offer it as a sideline. It’s a composed rice dish dotted with vegetables and morsels of meat or poultry that was probably inspired by the pilaf brought to India with the Muslim Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Many agree that the recipe’s sentimental home is the northern city of Lucknow, but biryani also migrated to southern India, where the dish is often associated with the high-tech city of Hyderabad, though regional variations, many of them vegetarian, exist nearly everywhere in the south.',\n",

Over a year old, the restaurant lies at the top of the hill, a plain room with wood wainscoting and white walls that gets narrower as you proceed to the rear.

       "  'Some with meat, seafood, and chicken, others vegetarian, there are 12 biryanis available in the Hyderabadi style. The flagship of this fleet is Hyderabadi dum chicken biryani ($11.95), featuring pieces of bone-in chicken hidden deep within, and multicolored rice with a delicate flavor. Break up the boiled egg to make the dish even richer, and pour on the tangy yogurt raita and the brilliant chile-peanut sauce called salan, a special feature of southern Indian biryanis.',\n",

The one called avakai biryani ($10.95 to $14.95, depending on the main ingredient) sports a lacing of mango pickle, while gongura biryani depends on an acidic fruit treasured in southern India. “But it’s not really a pickle in our sense of the word,” Kolani cautions. “It’s more of a green pickle gravy. It shows how much sour flavors are valued in southern India.”',\n",
       "  'Finally, when the version known as Vijayawada goat biryani ($13.95) arrives, the first thing you note is the stronger scent and darker cast to the rice. Though any biryani can be adjusted for level of heat, Vijayawada biryani is notably more highly flavored than the Hyderabadi versions, a veritable symphony of sweet spices.

If you’re enjoying raw soy crab in the five boroughs, odds are you’re dining at a select group of rustic Korean spots. The slithery meat hasn’t regularly found its way onto brasserie shellfish plateaus — or into the city’s thriving community of more creative Korean hangouts. In fact, when South Korean first lady Kim Jung-sook visited the Big Apple in 2017, she jetted over her own ganjang-gejang for a dinner in Flushing, claiming, correctly, that its availability was limited in the U.S.',\n",

       "  'She prepares the meat classically, letting female crabs soak in soy before chopping them into quarters. The flesh itself is translucent. It dissolves on the tongue like hot bone marrow — except the crustacean is cold, salty, and sweet, with a delicate tidal whiff. Koreans traditionally spoon the crimson roe over rice themselves; Park does the work for us, mixing in the eggs to give each grain a richly velvety mouthfeel. This all begs for crisp sheets of gim (dried seaweed), which are provided for making wraps. But really, the main event here is a singular one, and that is sucking out the meat from speckled oceanic appendages.',\n",

But the addition of Kawi to the ranks certainly doesn’t hurt. Indeed, it’s heartwarming to see a superstar operator show up to a $25 billion complex that’s become a bastion of bland steakhouses and use it to represent dishes that are still largely underrepresented, or undervalued, throughout the country’s fine dining scene.',\n",

The net effect of this cross-cultural alchemy is a blood-red product sporting the dense chew of a firm steak, the fire of hot wings, and the complex, nutty porkiness of Spanish Iberico. Even amid the city’s crowded Korean scene, Park, who’s worked at Ko, Per Se, and the three-Michelin-starred Gaon in Seoul, makes stunning fare that feels no less urgent.',\n",

Expansion at this level has typically involved standardization and replication; one could literally have the same meal at a dozen Nobus across the world. Chang has avoided this conundrum so far. As he’s moved from the role of chef to interplanetary restaurateur, he’s cultivated a cadre of lieutenant chefs who are building restaurants with personalities of their own, from Paul Carmichael’s Caribbean-Pacific tastings at Seibo in Sydney to Max Ng’s Singaporean-accented dishes at Ssäm Bar.',\n",
       "  'Times critic Pete Wells touched on these themes in a fine essay from last year, but a significant question remained: Would Momofuku be able to keep up the creativity after taking on an infusion of funds from RSE capital? Apparently, yes. Just as Chang has lit gustatory fires in sleepy hotels and casinos, the two restaurants he’s opened in posh shopping centers this year — not exactly paragons of innovation — have been as interesting as anything from his early East Village days. ',\n",
       "  'Kawi has some of the strongest flavors and spice levels of any Momofuku. Park deploys a sweet pepper sofrito to tame the funk of tiny raw clams — but only barely. She sends out spicy tuna kimbap that packs a level of heat more characteristic of a competitive eating contest. But because this wouldn’t be a true Chang spot if the rustic and refined weren’t juxtaposed, Park whips up a smash of a tofu dish too. She tops a layer of soft soybean curd with torched sugar. At the table, a waiter pours a ramekin of salmon roe on top. The layering of crunch, sweetness, silkiness, and slipperiness, all in one bite, with a yuzu perfume to boot, is as good as any Jean-Georges Vongerichten masterpiece. Call it tofu brulee.',\n",

Kawi makes its own rice cakes using an extruder; most restaurants buy theirs, and the result is a product that’s softer, lighter, and more tender than elsewhere. ',\n",
       "  'That process costs money, but in an exorbitant mall, it’s worth not overlooking value. Inasmuch as Chang complains about overpriced pasta, most Italian spots are nice enough to do half portions for a lower prices. The giant wagyu ragu could, at $35, could easily be downsized. Same goes for the cakes coated in Parmesan and (flavorless) summer truffle, which overwhelm the palate after just a few bites. Even the chilled chickpea noodles are expensive by any standard; one dips the firm pasta into a cool pool of sesame sauce, making for an excellent spring tsukemen of sorts. This easygoing dish runs a steep $28.',\n",

In a separate bowl sit all sorts of wings, drumsticks, thighs, and errant pieces of skin. They’ve been fried, sans batter, for a pure chicken crunch. A generous sprinkle of togarashi adds just the right amount of salt and heat. At $67, the dish is easily chicken for two, with enough leftovers for days.',\n",

Ice piles high in a wooden bowl, which a chef squirts with syrup and whipped cream. The flavors here are subtle and almost monochromatic. You dip your spoon into the volcano-shaped dome, retrieve a mass of snow, and let it dissolve on the tongue into pool of warming ginger. ',\n",

Nearly 75 years later, sole remains a staple of European and stateside fine dining, where it’s prepared in a way that suggests not much has changed since the postwar era.

Waiters present the fish skin on and head on; this is unusual for a flatfish, a group of maritime creatures that look like they were run over by a tractor trailer. The flesh, firmer and springier than a fluke’s but just as neutral, acts a conduit for fermented red and green chiles, served in ramekins, while the coral-hued skin recalls the tannic complexity of matcha or nori. It doesn’t taste as much of the ocean as it does of seaweed, acid, and fire. It is a regal fish reimagined as bar food. ',\n",

The more complex reality is that New York seafood has evolved in the 33 years since Maguy and her late brother, Gilbert, relocated their Parisian restaurant to New York. Namely, there’s a heck of a lot more competition now. Milos came along in 1997 with its jet set lavraki and yacht-friendly prices. Marea opened during the crash in 2009; it now sells caviar in the shadow of $100 million apartments. And in more recent years, the exorbitant sushi economy began its domination. Scores of tiny bars, many of them in hip downtown locales, cater to a moneyed clientele seeking (endangered) bluefin in all its fatty forms. ',\n",

Langoustines sport a mouthfeel that’s somewhere in between marrow and gelatin. Hiramasa, or amberjack, bleeds luscious oils. And poached skate boasts the soft, ropy mouthfeel of Cuban ropa vieja. Ripert and Eric Gestel, a longtime lieutenant who recently ascended to the position of executive chef, have not served bluefin for over a decade.',\n",

The beverage program has a generous feel to it as well.

They aren’t so much a performative flourish as they are the cornerstone of any dish, conveying endless layers of aroma, acid, meatiness, and creaminess. The result is a visual style that can veer closer to “rustic shallow soup” than “built for Instagram,” but none of that matters once you start eating. And slurping.',\n",

In 2019, that translates as sharp, salmon-y hat tips to India and North Africa. It also means a transatlantic take on the Spanish speaking world. The cooks sear octopus to a bouncy crunch — nothing unexpected there. Then the flavor station throws in a swatch of mole poblano, a few shoots of cilantro, and a pour of Spanish chorizo sauce. The flavor is sweet, grassy, and nutty at first, before giving way to a deep smokiness. Aldo then swings by with a half glass of Navazos Niepoort ($15), a non-fortified fino that cleanses the palate with a tongue-scrubbing yeastiness.',\n",

My server suggested a few dishes on the Asian fusion menu, and then added, without prompting, that she could “not recommend the bulgogi puffs.” It was a curious statement. I hadn’t asked about the bulgogi puffs, nor was anyone nearby tempting me with their puffiness or bulgogi-ness.

Instead, the pies are glazed in a creamy white-cheese sauce. It turns mealy and sticky quickly, causing the puffs to adhere to the plate like a gum on a shoe. ',\n",

When it comes to mashing up international traditions, few are more skilled than Ho, whom Wild Ink’s London-based parent company, Rhubarb, hired to consult on its new projects. The chef helped bring David Chang’s Momofuku Ssam Bar to the center of the culinary universe in the mid-aughts, mixing Korean, French, American, and Japanese sensibilities into an ambitious, affordable small-plates menu. He followed up with breathtakingly cross-cultural efforts at Ma Peche and Montmartre.

       "  'At Hudson Yards, his official title was culinary director for Rhubarb U.S., the local outfit of the British-based group famous for its insipid restaurants and catering venues. Just as his old boss, Chang, had evolved from a chef into a restaurateur, Ho was moving into a supervisory role as well. He had been working for “several months” with the Wild Ink team, per a spokesperson for the company, but less than eight weeks after the restaurant opened, Rhubarb and Ho announced they were parting ways. It just “wasn’t the right fit long term,” Ho said. The fact that Wild Ink says that no major menu changes are expected suggests things won’t get better.',\n",
       "  'Take the mapo tofu dumplings, created by chef Peter Jin. The point of this Sichuan speciality is to accent the silky squishiness of tofu with numbing peppercorns, fiery chiles, and maybe a bit of umami-packed pork. Jin, by contrast, cuts the soy into nano-sized cubes and stuffs them into fried wontons with an indistinct ragu. The wrappers turn soggy quickly, because the kitchen pre-sauces these guys, too.',\n",
       "  'The mapo bears almost no resemblance to its namesake dish. The same can be said about General Tso’s sweetbreads, which are more akin to Heinz 57-flavored chewing gum than the Cantonese-American staple.',\n",
       "  'There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with fusing diverse cuisines, experimenting with classics, or upscaling rustic preparations; Ho was once a master of this. These techniques can be an excellent way to get close-minded diners to venture outside of the false confines of authenticity, to expose patrons to a larger array of diverse cuisines, and to get everyone to think more carefully about the cultural makeup of a given dish. ',\n",
       "  'But the mapo disaster shows how things can get dicey when dishes are ripped from their original context and manipulated into something nearly unrecognizable. It’s hard not to be cynical about a creative process that sometimes feels guided less by taste or genuine inspiration and more by the type of profit-driven formulas that transform beloved classics into the type of click bait-y, Instagram-y dishes one might find at a clubstaurant or Cheesecake Factory.',\n",

Crab rangoon boasts a clear shellfish aroma and a remarkably light fry. Yuzu risotto is a smart bet, too. It’s a simultaneous ode to Japan and Italy, with the citrus cranked up to levels so insane that one could sell this dish as a scented candle. And yet, the fruit never manages to overpower the creamy rice or heady mushrooms. It’s a loud, beautiful creation.',\n",
       "  'And roast duck is passable enough, if you can make do with the dry confit leg and sinewy breast with under-rendered fat. That’s not quite a compliment, but the preparation is more forgivable than the scallops with dal.

Alas, Wild Ink plates such gritty legumes that they inadvertently act as an ode to the sandiness of poorly cleaned shellfish. ',\n",

Did the Rhubarb folks issue a cruel clubstaurant food mandate, arguing they’ll sell better with the mall crowd? Will things be this mediocre when the next Rhubarb spot opens at the Hudson Yard observatory?

       "  'Farida claims to be “the first and only Central Asian cuisine in the heart of Manhattan,” according to its website, but that’s not strictly true. As long as two decades ago, Kosher Uzbek restaurants such as the legendary Taam Tov flourished in the Diamond District, regaling customers with plov (rice pilaf), manti (boiled dumplings), lagman (handmade noodles), and shish kebabs, picturesquely grilled over a hoodless charcoal trough placed next to an open window. I’m not kidding! Though the place is still open, the hazard has long since been remedied. ',\n",
       "  'Much more recently, quick-service Central Asian places have popped up, such as Kebab Empire in Hell’s Kitchen, which calls itself Uyghur cuisine. But what Farida claims is not far from the truth, since the majority of our full-service Central Asian restaurants are in places like Sheepshead Bay, mainly night-clubby spots with pumping Casios like Palmyra, Kaifuem, and the original Nargis, which cater to Central Asian and Russian customers and specialize in banquets.',\n",
       "  'Farida is named after owner Farida Gabbassova-Ricciardelli, who runs the restaurant along with her husband, chef Umitjon Kamolov, nicknamed “John.” The place lies a few steps south of the Port Authority on Ninth Avenue, far from the mass of Central Asian restaurants in Brooklyn. But the couple opted for the Midtown neighborhood, declaring that it’s “always been a destination for international dining,” Gabbassova-Ricciardelli says — plus a great area for visitors.',\n",
       "  'It resembles neither a nightclub nor a quick-service cafe, but looks like many of the other small ma-and-pa restaurants that populate Ninth Avenue’s restaurant row. The dining room is deep and narrow, with an alcove in front, and a counter in back that looks into the kitchen. Murals and artifacts are distributed evenly, including battle axes, embroidered pillbox skullcaps, hanging caravan lanterns, and antique pistols. The servingware is particularly handsome, with a jagged blue pattern edged in gilt.',\n",
       "  'A Central Asian menu similar to others in town is offered, though not as complete as those of the Brooklyn plov palaces. Both Kamolov and his co-chef, Firdavs Saidov, hail from Samarkand — one of three most important Silk Road cities in Uzbekistan — while the owner is from Kazakhstan, but they try to have dishes from all over Central Asia.',\n",
       "  'Each part of Uzbekistan has its distinctive version of plov, the rice pilaf with Arabian roots. Elsewhere it usually comes heaped with ragged hunks of fatty lamb, but here the chefs substitute tender cubes of beef. Not a bad idea, unless you crave mutton’s funky musk. Carrots lend sweetness and fresh scallions are heaped on Farida’s agreeable version ($15), which is the one associated with the city of Samarkand.',\n",
       "  'The fist-shaped steamed dumplings called manti have a thinner noodle wrapper than usual, and can be ordered either stuffed with oniony lamb or pumpkin that’s slightly sweet, but not too sweet. Make sure you get some of that pumpkin filling one way or another: The same bright orange mince fills the flaky brown turnovers known as samsa ($8 for two), which are sprinkled with both black and white sesame seeds.',\n",
       "  'That brings us to the kebabs. Here, they’re called shashlyks, the term for Central Asian skewered meats that was popularized throughout Russia in the 19th century. Like Argentines and Texans, Central Asians demand the taste of smoke with their meat, choosing their cuts accordingly. Lamb is the king of kebabs due to its high fat content and ability to absorb maximum smoky flavor, and nothing is tastier at Farida than a lamb rib shashlyk ($9) left on the skewer, strewn with onions, and sided with a couple of garlicky shredded salads. Get fries or naan bread on the side.',\n",
       "  'The chicken wing shashlyk is also exceedingly succulent, but even better is the onion-laced lulya, which is made with ground beef shaped into an undulant column that ends up leaner than lamb.',\n",
       "  'But Farida is hardly a health-food restaurant. Take the Tashkent salad ($15), named after another of Uzbekistan’s glittering Silk Road cities and its capital. This decidedly ungreen salad features shredded daikon radish and shredded beef, with crisp fried onion on top, bound together in the Russian style with thick mayo. ',\n",
       "  'Want something healthy? Check out the mellifluous-sounding achichuk, which is mainly tomatoes goosed with fresh dill and onions. The soups are also magnificent at Farida, including a meal-sized lagman with plenty of handmade noodles something like udon. ',\n",

The food is wholesome and freshly prepared by a chef and crew that display a real zeal for the cuisine.

The only thing a culinary establishment really does to a bottle of Dom Perignon or a tin of osetra is mark it up and pop it open with a soft kiss that sounds like this: cha-ching. To truly justify a proper fish roe program, a restaurant needs to do more than resell the ubiquitous luxury from a nearby boutique. It needs to go beyond single glasses of bubbly that cost more than two bowls of ramen. A sevruga-slinging spot, in short, should be more like Air’s by Ariel Arce or the Riddler by Jen Pelka, two Village wine bars that make caviar and Champagne a touch more accessible — if not quite cheap.',\n",

Red neon tubes, shaped like lips biting a cork, glow above the soft banquettes. Teal lights shine behind cases of wine. And diners like me sit comfortably on velvet counter stools, sipping gold-hued wine out of flutes and nibbling on inky fish eggs. Caviar, the essence of the sea encapsulated into tiny pearls, often goes for at least $90. But here, a full ounce of kaluga runs $70. Baerri, a bit more elegant, costs just $55 for half an ounce; it shimmers in the candlelight, betraying a faintly emerald hue. The beads burst with a gentle pop and deposit luscious fish oil on the tongue to recall a slice of fatty tuna belly. ',\n",

Air’s can help in this regard, offering six Champagne pours at 20 bucks or less. At the Riddler too, waiters match fairly priced kaluga with hard-to-find bubbly, none of it pricier than $28 by the glass. True, these snacks will end up costing more than a dry-aged strip with fries, but it’s still a bargain way to feel luxe during an evening out.',\n",

That’s why it’s surprising that the wine world is that rare sphere of the city that’s trending more idiosyncratic and affordable-ish. Mid-range restaurants are increasingly turning their attention to quirkier skin-contact whites, pét-nat sparklers, and other natural wines, many of them exhibiting fun, funky, and unexpected flavor profiles.',\n",
       "  'Air’s and the Riddler rank among those venues — sort of. The interventionist methods used to produce Champagne, particularly the addition of yeast and sugar, don’t quite fit into the definition of “natural.” But the namesake region is experiencing its own promising changes, from the rise in biodynamic farming to the exploding popularity of grower-producers: modest houses whose wines are more personal and terroir-driven than the ultra-expensive gift-boxed bottles sold at duty free shops. ',\n",
       "  'Arce and Pelka are far from the only operators showing off grower Champagnes or other progressive wines. What makes these hospitality gurus more unusual rather, is how heavily they lean on those selections by the glass, while relegating obvious indulgences like Krug and Billecart-Salmon to spendier bottle selections.',\n",

Composed small plates and a buttery halibut dish that wouldn’t feel out of place at Le Bernardin make up the bulk of the Riddler’s food menu, but Air’s is more bare-bones, with mostly ready-to-eat dishes like raw oysters and charcuterie. One of them is très bougie. The other one is less bougie. Both are quite good.',\n",
       "  'Shortly after opening, Air’s cut its prices to 100 percent markup over retail, versus the more standard 200 to 300 percent. That translates to 50 or so bottles under $100. “Our goal is to expose as much Champagne as possible to as many people as possible,” Arce, a Hell’s Kitchen native, told Eater a few years back. Accordingly, a Jacques Lassaigne biodynamic blanc de blancs (made from only “Queen Bae Beyonce Chardonnay,” per Air’s), once $110 on the original menu, is now $85.',\n",
       "  'Like Terroir in Tribeca, the list offers an oenophilic education. It explains the role of chalky soil in the wine’s minerality, and argues that blended non-vintage bubbly is ideal for caviar, while rosé is better for charcuterie. Air’s is correct here: The faint sweetness in the rose Champagne counteracts the saltiness of spicy sopressata. And whatever crisp blanc de blanc they’re pouring by the glass — perhaps a J.L. Vergnon Murmure — will go nicely with the plump king crab; that wine’s acidity is powerful enough to cut the miso-brown butter with which it’s matched.',\n",
       "  'Shortly before a caviar sandwich ($20) appeared one night, my waiter poured an all pinot meunier selection and smiled. The pairing was brilliant; the lemon juice-like tang of the bubbly softened the mussel-like musk of the fish eggs. The eggs, a touch less firm than the kaluga and perhaps a whisper less complex, belonged to a breed of bowfin roe from Southern U.S. waters. The delicate coral beads, pretty enough to wear on a necklace, are available on their own for just $40 an ounce. ',\n",

That’s why we’re doing a burger,” Riddler’s founder and owner Jen Pelka told Eater NY this year, adding: “But we also want it to be a place that people can really come to celebrate.” It’s possible, of course, that Pelka has a Silicon Valley-tinged understanding of community or celebration. My first meal here — one appetizer, two glasses of Champagne, and that burger — ran $128 after tax and tip.',\n",
       "  'Here’s how the bottle list greets patrons: “Ask a sommelier for a 100 Club Scorecard to track all of the bottles of Champagne you try,” the document reads. “Those who purchase 100 different bottles will be awarded with a Riddler bomber jacket with your name embroidered in gold.” That proposition seems reasonable enough given that literally every brand, from Starbucks to Sweetgreen, has a rewards program. ',\n",
       "  'But since there’s just a single bottle of Champagne under $100 — with a tighter selection of half bottles and pét-nats, which also count — it’s worth mentioning that a patron will spend roughly $17,000 to join the so-called club.

At any ambitious American or Gallic restaurant, it’s unusual to encounter more than a single glass or two of Champagne for less than $30, so the fact that Pelka often offers seven under that bar makes it a welcome outlier. Among those fizzy wines is a Gonet-Medeville ($28), a brilliantly bracing non-vintage blend that’s almost as lean as grapefruit LaCroix.',\n",
       "  'With beverages like this, chef Nikole Morsink could have gotten away with more tavern-like offerings, like the $21 burger, which is cheaper than all but a single Champagne. It’s a fine, forgettable brisket blend with a layer of raclette that packs just enough funk to let you know it’s there. But Morsink, formerly at the Modern, seems to have something more ambitious in mind; the chef has a preternatural knack for either tweaking run-of-the-mill preparations or luxuriously exalting simple dishes.',\n",

Morsink tries something a bit more elegant: stripping the meat from its shell, poaching it in tarragon butter, and tossing the warm flesh with toasted almonds. The result is a crab with a bit more oceanic oomph than its cooler counterparts; the butter and almonds impart an intoxicating nuttiness.',\n",

Roasted halibut turns out more typically, but masterfully, French. Morsink anoints the white filet with a crown of chanterelles and a garnish of green shiso, then sets it over a foamy moat of mushroom broth. Think of the fish as an edible sponge for all the surrounding earthiness — not to mention a fatty foil for a glass of Noel Bazin brut rose ($25). ',\n",

       "  'The outdoor garden at Maison Yaki, a French-Japanese mashup in Prospect Heights, smells of charred meat and fresh wood. Servers ferry charcoal-grilled skewers slathered with sauces that bear names like maltaise and allemande, while the backyard deck radiates the pungency of sunbaked cedar. Two humans in shorts play pétanque, an old Provençal game similar to bocce. They take turns throwing steel balls, politely raking the gravel after each round, sometimes hitting the back wall where tiny strings of lights intertwine with creeping vines. And then, after a few minutes, a bearded host invites them back in for dinner.',\n",
       "  'On this evening, Maison Yaki is only a Slip’n’Slide short of qualifying as summer camp. And yet, the backyard acts as one of the most civilized waiting rooms in New York. ',\n",
       "  'Fans of Olmsted, a garden-equipped sister spot across the street, know a thing or two about waits and reservations. Maison Yaki, a casual spot where literally every dish falls under $10, improbably boasts some of the same inconveniences as Olmsted, giving away its best tables a month in advance; the only availability three Saturdays from now is at 10:00 p.m. But the little secret is that the kitchen serves the full menu out back. Waiters balance the crispy beef tongue katsu sandwiches on ledges, right by the two pétanque courts. ',\n",
       "  'As I wait for a friend one evening, I order a skewer of king trumpet mushrooms a la greque; the namesake lemon-wine sauce brightens up the meatiness of the fungi. At this point, the sky is starting to darken, and I’m cooling off with a fragrant yuzu gin & tonic. In this era where even an informal dinner can be planned with the precision of a Google Calendar invite, and secured with the threat of a Resy-backed financial penalty ($25 per person here), it’s nice to simply walk into a joint and eat standing up while playing alcohol-fueled lawn games.',\n",
       "  'A patron plays pétanque; a spread of dishes',\n",
       "  'Chef Greg Baxtrom, late of Stone Barns, has himself another winner here in Prospect Heights. And the good news is that the wait to dine indoors is much shorter here than at Olmsted, thanks to a 50/50 split between walk-ins and reservations. Kitchen counter seats overlooking the smoldering charcoals, or bar stools underneath the mini-indoor mushroom farm, turn over reasonably quickly on weeknights. ',\n",
       "  'Evenings here trend more affordable as well. Draft cocktails, including wonderfully strong Manhattans and martinis, cost $9. A full meal for one — two small plates, five skewers, two drinks, tax, and tip — will run about $80, versus $115 or so at Olmsted. That’s not cheap anywhere, especially not in a neighborhood where the median household income hovers around $62,000 per year. ',\n",
       "  'But relatively speaking, the prices are reasonable enough for a style of cross-cultural dining that doesn’t really exist elsewhere in the city. Maison Yaki is a cross between a French bistro and a Japanese yakitori spot, and most of the time, it’s a darn good one at that. ',\n",
       "  'For traditional rillettes — confit meat in a jar — a thick cap of white fat helps preserve the slow-cooked proteins. But in the fanciful world of Maison Yaki, a layer of wasabi-ginger foam, doing its best impression of lard, sits above a mound of shredded duck leg. The frothy tweak cuts through the poultry funk with finesse.',\n",
       "  'The history of French-Japanese culinary exchanges isn’t a short one, particularly at the high-end. Most long tasting menus owe a big debt to kaiseki cuisine. Joël Robuchon’s chain of L’Ateliers, which helped spur the modern movement of precise small plates, took its inspiration from sushi counters. And oodles of modern Japanese restaurants freely employ foie gras, black truffles, and other continental indulgences.',\n",
       "  'But yakitori spots and bistros tend to be a bit different. Their cuisines are more codified. That doesn’t mean they don’t evolve; it’s just that they operate within a stricter idiom. A bistro or brasserie suggests very specific things: steak frites, onion soup, potato preparations with non-English names. The same goes for skewer spots, which reliably traffic in minimally adorned meats, particularly off-cuts of chicken.',\n",
       "  'What’s particularly clever about Maison Yaki, however, is that it somehow finds it creativity by staying within these strictures. Snails are still snails, piping hot and showered in breadcrumbs, but they also burst with the anise-y sucker punch of shiso butter. Baguettes are still baguettes, though the accompanying butter shocks the palate with a body slam of tart-spicy yuzu kosho; it’s closer to hot sauce than soothing dairy. Chawanmushi is no less delicately eggy than at omakase spots; Baxtrom changes the formula just a touch with summer truffles and Franco-style braised artichokes.',\n",

       "  'This isn’t contemporary globalism; this is classic fusion. Almost every Japanese-leaning dish has a striking French accent and vice versa. And the lesson couldn’t be plainer: historically fixed genres can retain their essence even as they change. A Korean barbecue spot doesn’t become any less of a barbecue spot when it adopts the sensibilities of an American steakhouse. A pizzeria doesn’t become any less of a pizzeria because it doubles as a modern natural wine bar. And a yakitori spot doesn’t lose its soul just because the chef makes his tsukune-style meatballs — typically forged from chicken — with ground lobster. The lacquered sausage that comes off the grill, which Baxtrom douses in an oceanic-sauce Americaine, conveys a maritime aroma on par with the finest Gallic seafood soups.',\n",

This is not unexpected for a young venue. Cooking over open coals is a nuanced and difficult ballet. Watching a senior yakitori chef (or Uzbek grill meister) tend to their skewers is not entirely unlike observing a cartoon recluse water a pet orchid with an eyedropper. They tend to their craft with such care, it’s almost as if they’re praying as much as grilling.',\n",
       "  'The binchotan station at Yaki is a more frenzied affair, and it’s not always clear that the cooks are giving these meats their full attention. Gourmands know beef tenderloin takes well to sauces. Baxtrom translates this philosophy by applying the au poivre treatment to chicken tenderloins. The sauce itself is a work of art; it coats the tongue with a beefy, umami roundness, then jolts with a warming heat. The squishy little nuggets of tenderloin act as sponges for this fiery bliss. Well, except when the meat is overcooked.',\n",

       "  'One might logically ask about all the offal that typically define the modern yakitori spot. For now, items like gizzards and hearts only appear as specials, which is too bad because those off-cuts and viscera provide something that Yaki could do better with: texture. ',\n",
       "  'The variegated mouthfeels one experiences at venues like Tori Shin — thanks to snappy knee bones and rubber band-like arteries — help break up the fact that you’re essentially eating a whole lot of hot, fatty meat. Baxtrom’s old-school saucery, which harkens back to the era of Careme and Escoffier, serves a similar purpose, which is to achieve a sense of balance. But still, it would be nice if more of the skewers exhibited more than the soft or faintly chewy textures that dominate a meal here. ',\n",

The kitchen doesn’t lace it with tiny bits of bone, as is the norm; the fluffiness puts it closer to an Italian meatball than a Japanese one. You dip the succulent poultry into a ramekin of soy and what looks like yolk. Turns out the egg is really an avant-garde sphere of fruit puree that pops with the poke of a chopstick. “Duck a l’orange,” the menu says. Very cool. Equally cool is Yaki’s rare textural masterpiece, two chicken wings on a skewer. The skin shatters like the top of a creme brulee, while the silky flesh underneath yields with more ease. ',\n",

There, hawkers grill round rice crackers over charcoal, brushing the crisps with cream cheese, scallions, and then, to keep everything from burning, a thin layer of egg. This bánh tráng nướng, or Vietnamese pizza, is also commonplace in Orange County, California, home to one of the country’s biggest Vietnamese populations. But it’s been largely unavailable in New York.',\n",
       "  'That changed with Di An Di, a Greenpoint Vietnamese restaurant from Texas-native Dennis Ngo. When it opened, Ngo served a traditional bánh tráng nướng with bits of sweet ground pork, funky shrimp floss, and spicy jalapenos. ',\n",
       "  'But the hot spot, which champions the contemporary foods of Vietnam and its American diaspora, debuted something a bit different in December.',\n",
       "  'Ngo started dotting his rice crisps with the classic Vietnamese pairing of clams and rau ram, an herb that suggests cilantro perfumed with pine. And then he threw in some pork lardons and sweet chile sauce. The crust recalls crisp phyllo; it gives just a little before shattering. The clams, in turn, offer more chew than brine, acting as a soft counterpart to the snappy cracker, while the nuclear-powered rau ram punches the palate back into focus. ',\n",
       "  'The chef says the flavor combinations are true to Vietnamese sensibilities, but the dish inadvertently evokes a foodstuff that’s surely more familiar to scores of Northeasterners: a New Haven-style bivalve pie. The menu lists it both as a Vietnamese clam pizza and a bánh tráng nướng, reflecting a cross-cultural ethos that infuses so much of the restaurant’s cuisine, and that firmly plants Di An Di as a modern Vietnamese-American restaurant. And it’s an excellent one at that.',\n",
       "  'Long before contemporary chefs expressed indignation over Chinese dollar dumplings commanding one-twentieth of the price of ravioli, satirist Tu Mo had a few smart words about Vietnamese soup. “Don’t downgrade phở by labeling it a humble food,” he stated in a 1934 poem, as interpreted by cookbook author Andrea Nguyen. Mo, who touted the dish to oppose colonialist French rule, compared phở to “other international foods of note,” adding that “even the city of Paris,” that international gastronomic hub, has to “welcome” it.',\n",
       "  'Nearly a century later, Vietnamese spots pepper the Parisian landscape. And even though phở, like ramen, has a hard time breaking past the $20 mark in New York, it’s unquestionably solidifying its status as one of the city’s quintessential soups. Few would consider it humble — especially not at Di An Di, where the clear, complex broths are no less stunning than Gallic consommes.',\n",

To amp up the richness even further, a pile of scallion aioli lies underneath the grains.',\n",
       "  'Bánh tráng trộn, another stalwart of Lone Star Vietnamese cuisine, makes a rare New York appearance here.

Giant mounds of noodles lie at the bottom of each bowl, the translucent strands mirroring the broth’s flavors of cinnamon and star anise.',\n",

       "  'Best of all is the dry phở, currently off the menu but slated for a summer return. Patrons take wide rice noodles and dip them in sweet jasmine chile sauce and a concentrated bowl of chicken broth. This ecumenical approach to phở effectively makes Di An Di a Vietnamese analogue of sorts to Ivan Ramen, one of the few Japanese-style noodle shops to juxtapose shoyu, shio, tsukemen, mazamen, and other soup styles under a single roof. Diners can compare and contrast styles of phở here before seeking more dedicated versions elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'In the West Coast meat world, few names carry the import of Belcampo. Anya Fernald founded the restaurant and butcher chain in 2012 as a humane (and expensive) alternative to the industrial meat complex. She achieves such nobility through vertical integration; Belcampo owns not just ample farmland, but abattoirs designed by animal welfare expert Temple Grandin. According to a New Yorker feature titled “Can Steak Save the Planet?” an animal handler that has known a doomed cow since birth whispers in its ear before a bolt gun renders it unconscious. The grass-fed bovines live longer before slaughter, which the chain says gives the meat “richer flavor and better marbling.” The company even holds O magazine-touted $1,750 “meat camps” to teach consumers about responsible farming. ',\n",
       "  'Belcampo’s East Coast debut sounded like it could be game-changing entrant into New York’s meat scene. It is not. The restaurant, tucked away in an almost hidden corner of Hudson Yards, is simply where to get an affordable steak or burger in an expensive mall. ',\n",

The late, great, Pulitzer Prize-winning food critic sang praises of beef heart and goat tartare and “gloriously pink and juicy” roast beef on buttered toast. Other West Coast locations tout slow-cooked lamb with harissa and pork porterhouses. There are no such wonders at the Hudson Yards Belcampo. This is not date food, nor the type of food whose quality would cause a cold-hearted skeptic to adopt a more ethical style of eating. This is shopping food. ',\n",
       "  'The standard steak frites ($28) is a sirloin that the cooks grill over gas, slice, and serve with bearnaise butter. Grass-fed meat can be a beautiful experience; I recall filets that pack a vibrant, natural acidity. Belcampo’s sirloins, sadly, turn out bland and chewy, underseasoned and unevenly cooked. Virtually the same could be said of most burgers here. ',\n",
       "  'The progressive farm-to-table ethos does not extend to the beverages. Anyone pairing their beef with a nice red will encounter a fairly generic cabernet, pinot, or syrah.

       "  'Tartare or carpaccio: These are spot-on versions of the ubiquitous classics. The carpaccio, whose hue falls somewhere between pink and crimson, is sliced paper-thin. Flecks of fleur de sel shimmer on the surface. The meat weighs little more than lettuce, yet its round savoriness still softens the blow of peppery arugula. As for the tartare, it’s better than Thomas Keller’s more luxe version at nearby TAK Room. Neat little piles of capers, onions, scallions, and pickles sit above a disc of soft, cool beef. Most chefs like to mix in everything for the patron; this semi-deconstructed version evokes a good caviar platter in its elegance. ',\n",

The exterior cap, often the most flavorful and succulent part of the steak, has been  overcooked to the point of Dracarys-style carbonization. ',\n",

A mound of caramelized onions and white cheddar provide the bulk of the flavor, while the meat itself it little different from any generic diner burger. The 100-day burger ($28) boasts almost zero dry-aged flavor. It’s just a pile of tender meat on a bun, undercooked to the point of mimicking the texture of pate.

       "  'One of the strangest moments in late-night television came in 2004, when Adam Sandler asked Conan O’Brien whether he’d been to Per Se. The question made a certain degree of sense; Sandler played a fine dining chef in Spanglish. But still, celebrities appear on talk shows to seem relatable; they don’t go on about Lamborghinis or private jets. And yet here was comedy’s T-shirt-and-jeans everyman talking about one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with O’Brien admitting he’d been there too. Sandler even mentioned the owner’s name, Thomas Keller, the American godfather of the $1,000 meal.',\n",
       "  'No other culinary icon is more responsible for raising the bar on how much U.S. diners pay for a single dinner. Other fancy venues had four stars, but in the mid-aughts, Keller had the high-end zeitgeist. He enjoyed high-profile consultancies on that Sandler flick and on Ratatouille. One of his top waiters penned a celebrated memoir about the nightly wizardry at Per Se.',\n",
       "  'The coverage and reviews helped normalize feasts that could last hours and cost as much as a bi-weekly paycheck. Per Se’s success — the Times named it the city’s best restaurant, at least for a while — fueled a new class of extended-tasting-menu spots. Journalist Jodi Kantor argued venues like Per Se contributed to spendier $40 mains across the country. ',\n",
       "  'When Keller raises prices, others follow. This brings us to the case of TAK Room, Keller’s new endeavor at Hudson Yards. Most of its seats are filled on any given night. Its celebrity clientele has been documented by the Hollywood Reporter. But while it nominally specializes in midcentury fare, the true signature dish is more troublesome, both the way it’s executed and the frequency with which it intrudes upon every meal. That dish is the $100 entree. A single dish for one.',\n",
       "  'The $100 entree is not an outlier at TAK Room, a restaurant that largely mimics Keller’s Surf Club in Miami. More than half of the mains will effectively cost that much, after tax and tip. Keller is getting us to spend more, again.',\n",
       "  'Take the ribeye. It isn’t dry-aged, a time-consuming method that may warrant a higher cost; none of the steaks are here. It doesn’t sport the spinalis muscle, arguably the most succulent part of the ribeye, which has been butchered off for no good reason. It doesn’t even exhibit a particularly notable juiciness or beefiness. A spokesperson for the restaurant said the Snake River farms cut should rank from a 9 to 12 on the Japanese scale of marbling, which is about one would expect from ultra-expensive wagyu. In reality, the fattiness and flesh recalled the depth of something from Costco. It costs $106 after adding steak sauce.',\n",

But is it any better than the more complex roast at Smith & Wollensky, whose dry-aging imparts a nice Roquefort zing? It is not. Is the service better here? During a final visit, waiters poured free wine like it was tap water, and managers, captains, and staffers practically sent me off with full military honors. ',\n",

Nine brilliant courses will outweigh four misses. With a shorter three-course meal, though, the chef has just one shot at that main course. And the pain of that single large dud is multiplied when the price is double what it should be, a scenario that occurs too often at TAK. The $100 main that’s “just okay” functions less like a psychological barrier that diners need to overcome, and more like an income test: Those who can’t afford it don’t belong.',\n",
       "  'If Pe Se, in its heyday, felt like a smart cultural investment, along the lines of box seats at the opera or a limited-run play, TAK Room takes on a different air. It belongs to a group of venues for which prices act not as a signifier of quality but rather as a cover charge. Harry Cipriani is the classic example, while TAK, alongside neighboring Estiatorio Milos, are the more modern ones. The a la carte format in this case lets the 1 percent flex their wealth — amid the company of their privileged brethren — without the burden of a four-hour meal or throngs of destination diners seeking culinary enlightenment. It’s just dinner.',\n",

One could literally fit a sushi bar in its foyer and a cruise ship waterslide on its carpeted staircase and it wouldn’t feel any less roomy. ',\n",

TAK Room would be well served to offer descriptions, but the only preparation to receive any type of narrative explanation is the strip steak. The large menu blurb, which is more of a sales pitch, describes the Japanese-Angus hybrid as “the best of both worlds,” and as a meal “for two or for one.” It is among the first items a waiter might recommend. The sixteen-ounce entree costs $206 after tax, and tip. ',\n",
       "  'One wishes a steak so rich could come in a portion that’s a quarter of the size — and price. But the goal here is anchoring, ensuring that high-cost dishes make all the other items seem less preposterous by comparison.

It’s effectively a bland mash of textureless nightshade in a tomb of mozz and sandy breadcrumbs.',\n",
       "  'Oxtail consomme ($32) is the smarter choice. The meat’s natural gelatins cause one’s lips to stick together, while the broth itself is pure black truffle intensity. Dover sole also does what it should, acting as a soft, flaky conduit for capers and lemon. Still, it is little different from any other sole preparation anywhere else in town.',\n",
       "  'When one thinks of TAK Room, it’s hard not to draw comparisons with the Grill in the old Four Seasons space, that atavistic temple to power. The midcentury-minded spot puts quite a few mains in the $100 club. But many of the entrees fall way below that mark. And the Grill casts a wider net on the past, serving up stellar fare that simply isn’t available elsewhere, from Amish ham steaks to pasta with duck organ juices.',\n",
       "  'TAK Room’s interpretation of yesteryear is narrower and more subtle; it doesn’t feel that different from most contemporary bastions of beef. Steak tartare is distinguished by its mediocrity; it is simply cold cubes of steak with a one-note vinaigrette. Tableside Caesar salad lacks any of the anchovy or Parmesan umami or buttery croutons as elsewhere. It is cold lettuce with dressing. The $26 crabcake is a study in bland meat and a lot of breadcrumbs. Black truffle fettuccine ($46) almost entirely masks the tuber’s earthy flavor in hot cream. The texture is sludge.',\n",
       "  'Better is the Wellington for two ($138), a wonderful riff of the classic, nixing bland tenderloin for a mid-rare short rib that’s almost impossibly heady. The beef needs the pastry crust, (spongy) mushroom duxelles, and truffle sauce to keep its powerful aromas in check. Too bad a smaller, more affordable portion isn’t available for less. ',\n",
       "  'There’s something to be said for a whole fish spot saying, “This is how big our turbot is, we only have one left, and we charge by the pound.” Steaks, however, are the product of in-house butchery. A restaurant that wants to charge less can simply use a knife.',\n",

He’s making a choice to charge more, just as he’s made a choice to build his more affordable and creative full-service concepts elsewhere, concepts such as Ad Hoc and La Calenda, a Oaxacan spot in Napa Valley. It would be a shame if the takeaway for developers was that we need more restaurants like TAK Room, restaurants where the $100 entree is not just a viable but a desirable goal for more owners and operators to pursue. Sure, it works here. It will likely work elsewhere; there are enough bankers to charge ridiculous prices. Keller knows how to issue a premium on wealthy New Yorkers for fancy food. Now it’s time for him to show he can do something ambitious for the rest of us.',\n",
       "  'Cost: Easily $200 per person or more for 3-4 courses. Remember that most mains are a la carte, as is typical in most steakhouses. That means an $85 filet comes with neither sauces ($6-$12) nor sides ($14).',\n",

       "  'Before you scoff at the price of a gooseneck barnacle — the worm-shaped creature can fetch $100 per pound — understand that there is no such thing as a farm-raised species. The crustacean thrives on wave-battered rocks and cliffs. Those who collect them, on the Iberian or Pacific Coasts, are equal parts fishers, foragers, and climbers. Their toolsets include wetsuits, harnesses, clamps, and when necessary, ropes for rappelling. To harvest a barnacle means to risk death. But to consume one, a possibility at the spectacular Saint Julivert Fisherie in Brooklyn, means to sample one of the world’s great delicacies. ',\n",
       "  'Alex Raij and Eder Montero are among a handful of New York chefs to serve the percebe, as it’s known in Spanish. The stubby, ugly creatures serve as a stark visual contrast to the crab-stuffed avocados and other attractive small plates in which Saint Julivert specializes. The calcified head of a gooseneck evokes a malformed clam, while the brown thorax recalls a petrified lizard phallus. They are boiled in salt water and served as is. No sauce, no lemon. A waiter advises twisting off the leathery body, revealing a single longitudinal muscle. Sometimes that muscle is pink. Sometimes it’s tan or black. In neither case does it appear edible or delicious. ',\n",
       "  'Rest assured, it is both. The texture mimics that of a razor clam. And the flavor might suggest a Nantucket Bay scallop in its sweet wintry prime. Or it might, depending on the barnacle, convey its sugars in a more restrained fashion, like those of a Maine lobster. Still others recall the briny wallop of a crashing wave pulling you under. Each bite is unique. What is inevitable, however, is that three minutes into eating, your hands will turn sticky with shellfish juice. ',\n",
       "  'Such a pristine expression of the sea doesn’t come cheap; Saint Julivert asks $30 for about 20 thumb-sized goosenecks. But if a dozen oysters can run $50 elsewhere, or if a tin of caviar can command $100 anywhere in the city, it’s hard not to think of this rare barnacle for what it truly is: a value. And with this dish, it’s hard not to think of Saint Julivert, a single room of a restaurant on a quiet Cobble Hill street, as one of the city’s best places to eat fish.',\n",
       "  'New York has many new seafood spots; few of them are accessible or interesting. Contemporary operators have largely used the oceans of planet Earth, the source of so much biodiversity and (occasionally) sustainable bounty, to fuel a spate of blandly expensive restaurants. These venues primarily exist within a tight band of European or Japanese traditions; one thinks of the burgeoning sushi spots built for an army of finance and tech workers. Or consider the (admittedly more global) Pool with its $200-per-person dinner tabs. Or how about the new Milos opening in Hudson Yards? The website for that Greek palace offers Mediterranean yacht rentals.',\n",
       "  'A touch of skepticism about Saint Julivert, in other words, is hard to avoid. And at first glance, nothing about the restaurant suggests it’s a boundary-pushing establishment. It sits amid a row of $5 million brownstones. Inside, patrons in cable-knit sweaters and flannel vests sip at beet-juice cocktails. The whole tableau feels very J.Crew, very suburban upper middle class, very basic.',\n",
       "  'A perusal of the menu, however, reveals that any skepticism is misplaced. Saint Julivert succeeds more than any other venue in channeling the world’s oceans into a distinctly New York expression of maritime internationalism. The chile-flecked bill of fare boasts influences from Peru, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Portugal, Mexico, and China. Almost every dish is under $20. ',\n",
       "  'And just about every trope of modern oceanic eating is absent. Gone is the four-bite, $30 plate of deep-sea snapper sashimi. Banished is the altitudinous shellfish tower, gleaming with chipped ice and chilled clams. And there is most certainly no caviar service.',\n",
       "  'There aren’t even oysters on the half shell. Instead, the kitchen fries the bivalves tempura style and stuffs them inside a beef tenderloin sandwich — a meaty, mineral surf-and-turf po’ boy. The chefs also place oysters, plumped under the broiler, atop layers of pig ear and kombu doused in crimson chile oil. The net effect is a kaleidoscopic terrine of swine and sea, with all squishy, umami-rich proteins yielding to a lingering pepper burn. ',\n",
       "  'Few other ambitious seafood spots — the thrilling Le Sia notwithstanding — deploy the pain and tingle of heat with such confidence. Tiny dried prawns, and a squeeze of lime, add a bit of funky zip to ramekin of spicy roasted peanuts.

The resulting wrap expresses the component flavors and textures — acid, anise, grassy crispness, marshmallow softness, and complex nuttiness — with laser-like precision. Fluke ceviche also gets the job done, letting the neutral flatfish act as a conduit for a wallop of lime, onion, and cilantro.

Raij and Montero blacken the exterior with a copious blend of thyme, chiles, and allspice, dampening the fish’s rampant oils with nuclear-powered aromas. It might not pack the intoxicating hardwood smoke of proper jerk, but the Jamaican spices come through unabated. Consider pairing the collar with sorullitos, Puerto Rican corn fritters shaped like cigars; they function as a silky, starchy antidote to the heady fish.',\n",

       "  '“Even Jennifer Lawrence had to wait for a table at Brooklyn hotspot Lilia,” a New York Post headline read this spring. One can relate. A new rite of passage for New York gourmands is approaching the host at the Williamsburg destination and getting quoted a wait time that seems mathematically impossible. Those who arrive just before 5 p.m. will encounter a line that stretches down the block. And those who check for online reservations will think they’ve happened upon the ticketing website for Elton John’s goodbye tour — nothing available. ',\n",
       "  'The reason for such insanity is the cooking of Missy Robbins, a singular commodity in a city where Italian food is nothing less than ubiquitous. No one else seems to lace their garlic bread with speckles of orange bottarga, or dust their mafaldini with coarse grinds of pink peppercorns. When Pete Wells came to review Lilia in 2016, he awarded three stars and issued a specific bit of praise: ”Pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness,” the NYT critic wrote. Demand quickly outstripped supply. ',\n",
       "  'A sequel was all but inevitable. And so in September Robbins opened a second spot, Misi, in the heart of the $3 billion Domino Sugar redevelopment. Here the focus would be more streamlined. While the menu at Lilia spans multiple categories, Misi’s only starters are vegetables. The only desserts are gelati. And the only mains — beefy specials notwithstanding — are pastas, all made in a 325-square-foot, temperature- and humidity-controlled room. ',\n",
       "  'Feel like swinging by? As I write this, the next available reservation is at 11:00 p.m. On a Monday. One month from today. For counter seating. Walk-ins who show up late might sit down immediately, while those who swing by at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday can wait 90 minutes or longer for bar seats. It’s all enough to make one assume that Robbins has again given New York one of its best new Italian restaurants. If only that were the case.',\n",
       "  'Misi, at the very least, is a scene. Here’s Bobby Flay on a date. There’s Action Bronson, sporting his signature beard. Golden helium balloons float about in the private room next door. Four hosts greet patrons behind a low-rise table; it recalls the check-in counter at a chic charity event. The open kitchen shines just brightly enough to flatter patrons at the chef’s counter. The bartenders pour frothy bellinis that diners suck down in seconds. The servers whisk over uneven pastas. The prime window seats overlook the Williamsburg Bridge in all its nocturnal... wait, there’s an issue with the pastas?',\n",
       "  'There is. The noodles range from serviceable — like a forgettable pappardelle with chickpeas — to nearly disastrous — an oppressively saline bowl of fish sauce-laced linguine. In fact, the pasta problems are distinct enough that they can stop a bona fide Robbins aficionado mid-sentence. ',\n",
       "  'A few weeks ago my companion was monologuing about the genius of the chef and her roasted romanesco. Robbins showers the toothsome florets with an electric blend of lemon juice, olive oil, and coriander, imparting the stubby brassica with a vibrancy that’s at once electric, luscious, and fragrant. Then I watched my friend turn silent as he tried the carpaccio-like corzetti. Handsome rounds of pasta sat underneath an insipid tomato sauce and a canopy of fresh basil; the herb obliterated whatever nuance there might’ve been in the first place.',\n",
       "  'Clockwise left: Spinach ricotta tortelli, chef Missy Robbins, the bar and dining room at Misi',\n",
       "  'This is not the Missy Robbins we know, the mind behind one of the pastas of the decade: Lilia’s agnolotti with sheep’s milk ricotta. She uses saffron-infused honey — a bit of sugar and perfume — to counteract the tartness and funk of the cheese. The interplay of flavors is almost scientific in its balance, and yet the pairing is as simple as a composed cheese plate. ',\n",
       "  'Or consider her rigatoni al diavola, also at Lilia. Spicy tomato sauce is a common enough preparation, but it somehow tastes cleaner and more alive under Robbins’s control. The San Marzanos are brighter and more acidic than elsewhere, while the Calabrian chiles exude a warming spiciness. ',\n",
       "  'It’s from these two dishes that one derives a certain Tao of Robbins. The chef tweaks classic preparations in such a way that they taste fresh and revelatory. And she concocts gently creative pastas that somehow feel intuitive and seamless within the multitudinous traditions of Italian cooking. She’s neither an avowed regionalist, like the devoutly Tuscan Rita Sodi, nor a more freeform experimentalist, like the chefs at Don Angie. At her best, Robbins is a pasta pragmatist, drawing on countless styles and influences to make absolutely inimitable noodles. ',\n",
       "  'At Misi, by contrast, the only consistently impressive thing about the pastas is their al dente firmness.',\n",
       "  'Robbins can do better. She concocts a briny (if thin) clam broth and pairs it with a pile of gently mealy malloreddus, a small Sardinian gnocchi. The golden liquid doesn’t permeate the bland pasta, nor does the dish bring any of its promised saffron aroma. Rigatoni, boasting a tomato sauce with 30 cloves of garlic, assaults the palate with salt and cheese. Strangozzi, long, thick noodles, get tossed with a one-note pork ragu; the dish begs for a rounder flavor (and maybe just a touch of acid). And linguine with anchovy and colatura — an Italian fish sauce — packs a level of salt that gives the brain a very distinct message: Stop eating. Which we did.',\n",
       "  'And then there were the white truffles. The seasonal fungi, at their best, exhibit a pungent fragrance that lingers in the air on the palate for minutes. Here, they’re shaved over an otherwise fine fettuccine with Parmesan and buffalo butter. But the aroma is short and flat, like that of a Designer Imposter cologne instead of the real thing. At $91, it could put a novice off this luxury forever.',\n",
       "  'The only pasta that shows any real sign of classic Robbins brilliance are the occhi, little ravioli that the cooks stuff with sheep’s milk ricotta and drench in butter, bottarga, and lemon zest. Not a single element falls out of balance; the warm dairy heats up the roe, releasing its perfume, while the aromatic citrus and puckery cheese keep the maritime tang in check. ',\n",
       "  'The smart strategy at Misi is to order the occhi and stock up on another forte of Robbins: vegetables. Cooks roast eggplants until they exhibit the texture of pudding and drizzle the insides with crimson Calabrian chile oil. You scoop out the smoky, spicy, fleshy insides with a spoon and eat this happy dish like a child devouring ice cream. The kitchen takes grilled bread the thickness of Texas Toast and pipes whipped ricotta on top. The cheese shimmers like marshmallow fluff. Diners finish plating the crostini themselves, placing blistered and vinegared peppers on top. The result is pure cream, char, and crunch. ',\n",
       "  'If a porterhouse for two is offered, order it ($110). The meat veers away from the prevailing New York style of steak, an ode to aging and blue cheese funk. Robbins instead opts for a more cheffed-up preparation, crusting the exterior in fennel pollen, charring it rare, and drizzling enough lemon juice over the cut to qualify it as a modern, high-acid dish. The flavors are simple and pure: concentrated beefiness followed by the mellow sweetness of singed anise.',\n",
       "  'Steak, of course, calls for ice cream. Mint gelato manages to exhibit the assertive grassiness of the herb without any of the menthol-like sting. Toasted almond, as tan as khakis, pushes the envelope on what a frozen dessert is; it mirrors the texture and richness of finely ground nut butter. And fior di latte does what that flavor does best: expresses the taste of fresh milk as cleanly as mozzarella.',\n",
       "  'In this shiny slice of Williamsburg, the gelati are a fine way to end what’s, unexpectedly, a perfect steakhouse meal of sides, martinis, wine, and, if it’s available, that porterhouse. But as a pasta spot that people wait a month to get into for an 11 p.m. reservation, it needs work. Robbins, who helped make regulars out of the Obamas during her days at Spiaggia in Chicago, is unquestionably one of the country’s great Italian chefs.

But Pheasant has found another way. Tentacles are braised for up to two hours and pan-roasted in olive oil, then deposited in a slurry of spicy liquid salami and the concentrated yogurt called labneh, providing a funky and sour contrast to the blandness of the creature, which develops a texture like red licorice laces. The effect of this $16 dish is to make octopus lovers very happy.',\n",

The restaurant is descended from a catering company called Little Pheasant, run by Cat Alexander along with her husband and chef Vincent Fraissange, who was formerly executive chef at Taavo Somer’s experimental Williamsburg restaurant Isa.',\n",
       "  'Pheasant’s 16-item menu is one of those that doesn’t really distinguish between apps and mains, and some of the former can function as light meals, especially if you’re not too hungry. The bill of fare incorporates diverse and sometimes wild Mediterranean elements into such bistro commonplaces as hanger steak, seasonal vegetables, roast chicken, a twisted burger, quirky salads, and “day boat” halibut.',\n",
       "  'Take a favorite seasonal vegetable — thick-stalked asparagus — perfect in its freshness and snap. You almost wouldn’t recognize it at Pheasant. The rods have been lightly battered like tempura, flash fried so no limpness results, then scattered on the plate with puffy buttons of potato mousse and cooling slices of ham. Ham? Yes, and not prosciutto, either, but good old American smoked ham like your mom or dad might have put in your sandwich if you grew up in the Midwest. The dish ($11) is summery dining perfection, and might be the best thing on the menu.',\n",
       "  'Is that menu overly creative? Not for me. I enjoyed the Fez salad; it douses greens and vegetables with a carrot-cumin vinaigrette. I also loved a red endive salad that added pecans and goat cheese to the crunchy lettuce, and swamped them in a sherry vinaigrette that was thicker and more opaque than its name suggests. It’s a dish that disappeared from the menu last week but will be back next year, when the seasons change again. ',\n",
       "  'That dish really just shows that you can’t go wrong picking vegetables as your meal at Pheasant. This is especially true with the single vegetarian entrée ($18) — itself an inviolable trope of neighborhood bistro menus.

No better place to chill outdoors with a couple of charred carne asada tacos and a tumbler of cerveza.',\n",

Claro, though the owner never stepped foot in Salazar, came close, showing that the Gowanus Canal and the Los Angeles River maybe aren’t all that different. A wood-fired hearth flickered in a backyard filled with tables beneath vine-covered trellises, while cicadas buzzed merrily in the background. But though it was outstanding, it still didn’t quite recapture my LA experience.',\n",

The executive chef is Justin Bazdarich, who previously hatched the pizzeria Speedy Romeo. ',\n",
       "  'Besides all the ways it resembles LA’s Salazar, the restaurant is yet another example of the accelerating appreciation of Mexican food in New York — in part due to the taquerias and decades of immigrant participation in restaurant kitchens.

       "  'Though some of the most notable restaurants serving ambitious, expensive versions of the cuisine are run by Mexican chefs (Cosme, Casa Enrique, Atla), it’s a scene that’s also conspicuously filled with people who have come to enjoy the cuisine as outsiders — like Bazdarich and his business partner Chris Walton, self-described “white kids from Missouri.” Claro and Gitano are also examples, as is the Empellon empire, where Oxomoco’s chef de cuisine Matt Conroy once worked. Here, Bazdarich pulled from his memories of traveling to the country; he and Conroy also brought on Oaxacan-born chef Kaelin Ulrich, son of famed Oaxacan chef and teacher Susana Trilling, to consult during the initial months of menu creation.',\n",

A relish made of pipicha — a feathery herb that tastes like dirty mint — crowns the jiggly meat, as does a squash blossom that doesn’t add much but sure looks pretty riding shotgun. Sadly, the price of $16 for two tacos is exactly twice the cost at Salazar.',\n",
       "  'Other Oxomoco tacos worth tasting include pig cheek with green avocado salsa, flank steak with smoked eggplant relish and rubbery cotija cheese (now served with caramelized onions), and tempura-fried hake (now it’s shrimp), reminding us that the Baja Peninsula, the original home of the fish taco, is considered part of the Sonoran Desert. But a vegetarian taco of beets and potatoes intended to resemble chorizo is bland and boring.',\n",

Whatever you do, don’t miss the creamy charred-carrot tamales, which come pooled in a verdant sauce. The steak tartare tostada ($16), exceedingly fresh beef cut into a ragged dice, is preferable to a tuna tostada that makes too-lavish use of soy sauce, which clashes with the corn tortilla. In fact, I’d skip anything featuring raw fish at Oxomoco, including the hamachi aguachile. What New York City really needs is a full-blown Mexican cevicheria.',\n",

This was not an artisanal product but an industrial one — neon corn puffs enrobed in dehydrated cheddar. Their bright orange hue took on the air of bioluminescence against the Christmas-green bar stools. I ate the puffs in between sips of passion fruit-laced milk punch; when I finished them the waiter asked if I’d like more. This transaction occurred in less time than it typically takes to get $7 bread service at a more upscale establishment. The cheeseballs were free. ',\n",
       "  'There were three staffers in the restaurant that night: the waiter, co-owner Bill Clark, who worked the front of the house, and co-owner Libby Willis, who oversaw the kitchen alone. Willis sent out my coconut-crusted sweet potato atop a pool of salsa verde and mole poblano, the sugary starch acting as a counterpoint to the tart, nutty, fiery sauces. I paired the dish with the restaurant’s signature Manhattan, a cocktail that Clark’s grandmother reportedly drinks every day. It was a big Manhattan.',\n",

Then other patrons started showing up, and I was no longer alone, though really, I never was. ',\n",
       "  'The fact that MeMe’s is a newly opened diner — not to mention a queer-owned business with a largely queer and diverse staff — makes it an outlier of sorts, even if the term “diner” is loosely applied. A diner, after all, is supposed to serve lunch and breakfast; MeMe’s does not. And a diner is supposed to be old, which doesn’t say much for the future of the form. A Crain’s article from 2015 suggests the number of these establishments have dropped by nearly 60 percent over the past 25 years. The reasons are similar to why other small-time operators have been closing: The cost of business is going up as rents and labor costs continue to rise.',\n",
       "  'This reality is even tougher for a diner. Patrons expect longer hours, lower check averages, a patty melt that never changes, and epically lengthy menus, all in a venue where they can sit and read the newspaper for an hour and get free refills. And therein lies the paradox. Everything that allows independent restaurants to adapt to the city’s brutal restaurant economy, from seasonal menu innovations, to performative sourcing (organic this, fair trade that) to never-ending price hikes, goes against the very nature of what a diner is supposed to be: a stable respite from our brutally mutating capitalist world. ',\n",
       "  'Channeling the ethos of a diner, in other words, comes with handcuffs that are both financial and nostalgic. Willis and Clark succeed by playing by some of the rules; there are the lowish prices, the giant dinner portions.

A more composed brunch or dinner, with a beer, tax, and tip, will run about $30.

The wait staff is happy to bring seconds. ',\n",
       "  'Willis and Clark base their approach to American comfort fare on a mix of “international pantry staples” (chile oil, fish sauce), “farmer’s market greens,” and “bodega standards,” to use their words. The cereal clearly belongs in the bodega camp. So do the migas — soft-scrambled eggs with cilantro served in a bag of Fritos. As the chipotle cream and green salsa absorbs into the corn chips, they soften into a glorious, fork pierce-able mush. Pair this with a few slices of Maldon-flecked cinnamon toast.',\n",

Willis surrounds them with a tidy moat of chile oil, the shallow pool filled with pepitas, sunflower seed, and poppy seeds. The flavor is gentle at first, complexly nutty, crunchy, and smoldering. And then pepper-laced greens assault the palate with a stinging uppercut of heat. ',\n",
       "  'In the evenings, the right way to kick off a meal is with the fried giardiniera, a fritto misto improved by the acidic tang of pickled carrots, cauliflower, and banana peppers.

Near the rear of the room, portraits of a bespectacled Sorbillo stare down from the walls like Big Brother.

The lower-cost pies revel in this simplicity, using mainly canned San Marzano tomatoes, domestic and imported mozzarella, and a drizzle of flavorful olive oil. Consistent with the genre, these pies are limp and damp in the middle, so you may have to pick up a knife and fork to eat them. ',\n",

My favorite of all, Nduja ($22) is associated with Calabria, the toe of Italy’s boot. Across its surface lie little splotches of liquid salami, with rings of purple onion strewn around like hula hoops. The calzone’s worth ordering too, a Neapolitan specialty that wraps the same dough around a filling of ricotta, mozzarella, and salami, propelled by black pepper, making a meal of incredible richness.

One evening, a friend and I tested pizzas topped with porcini mushrooms and black truffles (the Firenze and the Alba, respectively priced at $30 and $35).

Heck, if you have a fresh truffle, it’s not a bad idea to put it on a cheese pizza, but you must shave it on at the last minute.',\n",

       "  'First, there are the pastas, which tend to taste like something thrown together from leftovers. Pasta e piselli ($19) features tubettini, like stunted rigatoni, tossed with peas and bacon, but deriving little smoky benefit from the bacon. And the peas taste exceedingly tired. Nobody told the recipe developer that Americans don’t much like small, stale peas in their pasta.',\n",

Why even put them on the menu; who expects pizzaioli to make good pasta, anyway?',\n",
       "  'Not surprisingly, the apps mainly fail as well, including an adamantine version of fried calamari bested by nearly every bar in town, and salads that are mainly a heap of dry arugula and a few tomatoes that arrive entirely undressed. Yes, good olive oil and a so-so bottle of balsamic appear on the side, but really this is just the beginning of an acceptable dressing.',\n",
       "  'Then there’s a starter that consists of an unadorned lump of mozzarella and a pile of flavorless mushrooms without as much as a shake of salt. Overpriced at $21, it was as if someone proclaimed, “Dig up some apps that won’t take us a bit of trouble to make and charge plenty for them.”',\n",

In the latter category, the sautéed escarole accented with black olives and capers is the soul of southern Italian cooking, and the same vegetable served with grilled sausage is similarly delicious, though at $21 for a single split sausage, it doesn’t really reflect the generosity and abundance of the cuisine.',\n",

And what was that wonderfully thick texture from? Modernist flourishes like xanthan gum and agar agar, per a list of ingredients as long as that of a Snickers bar. And a month after the meal, I read that little essay, about how the sauce owes its complexity to an aged soy called jinjang — that’s been fermented for five years. So what was apparently just another delicious dish is actually, the diner understands, something more meaningful and contextual, a blending of the new and the old.',\n",

Neither option does much good when you’re trying to prime your palate for a one-bite course, or when you want something more detailed than an iPhone pic to jog your memory following a long dinner. Atomix’s cards solve that problem, letting guests focus on minor components they might overlook, like the dried sea cucumber innards used to season thinly sliced beef.',\n",

Like an opera program that helps a viewer navigate the minutiae of Tosca, or a gallery blurb that lets visitors make sense a perplexing Cubist work, the menu cards serve an equally important purpose. They employ a bit of unobtrusive explaining to make a complicated and expensive art form more accessible.',\n",

For a menu of this length, it’s even a tidy sum less than Jungsik ($290 after tax and tip), the two-Michelin-starred bastion of Korean fine dining in Tribeca, where chef Park served as the chef de cuisine. ',\n",

A second bite reveals a layer of foie gras terrine underneath, imparting a buttery oomph to the neutral fish. A third bite causes the liver to spill out, clouding the surrounding pool of squash dashi with its pink hue. ',\n",

The bottom-feeding crustaceans, sometimes known as mountain lobsters, crawdads, yabbies, or mudbugs, have been part of Gulf Coast Cajun cuisine for centuries, but are still relatively new to the China; they were brought from the States through Japan as food for bullfrogs in the 1920s. And while crawfish were once the bane of regional rice farmers, they have become, largely over the past few decades, part of a multibillion-dollar industry that employs over 5 million, primarily in the Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangsu provinces.

The hodgepodge of spices are used to fortify a shellfish stock that’s cooked until it’s as dark and flavorful as the brown goo that spills out of a scorched shrimp head.',\n",

Gloves are licked, noses are blown, and chile-triggered sinuses are cleared.

It’s about technique — ensuring a steamy broth doesn’t overcook, say, langoustines while they’re en route to the dining room.

This is the result of a waiter pouring soy over a hot metal plate, the final flourish for a dish of foie gras atop crispy rice. This tableside pomp, alas, is for naught; the kitchen sears the duck liver to a meaty medium rare, but the rice is simply a disc of hot mush, with little of the promised crunch.',\n",

       "  'When rice was primarily a staple, “a stomach filler, a vehicle for other foods,” it was, and often still is, “simply cooked by steaming,” author Najmieh Batmanglij writes in her excellent A Taste of Persia. But as modern cultivation methods developed over the centuries “the grain itself became a luxury,” she states, stressing that this was the case in Iran, as in Asia. Her geographic comparison is an astute one. The most expensive rice is generally sushi rice; aficionados tend to comment on its vinegar and temperature levels as if they were praying to a first-growth Bordeaux. But during whatever little discussion there is about Iranian cuisine in New York, rice itself is rarely mentioned as the complex indulgence it can be. ',\n",
       "  'The process of making saffron rice can involve rinsing the grains up to five times, parboiling them, steaming them, and gently scorching the bottom layer to form a nutty, golden crust called tahdig.',\n",

       "  'The rice is firm, almost al dente. Like a mound of good caviar, the grains roll around on the tongue separately, without clumping. The dish smells richly of butter. On the palate, the flavor starts as vaguely sweet, and is then followed by the unmistakable pungency of saffron. It is not difficult to find decent saffron rice at the city’s kebab-heavy Persian spots; it mostly comes free as a side dish. At the skewer-free Sofreh, by contrast, this masterful version justifiably carries a separate charge, steakhouse style. Even next to gently griddled patties of ground beef in a pomegranate sauce, the strikingly nuanced rice steals the show.',\n",
       "  'Sofreh is an ode to the multitudinous flavors of Iran, from fruit-studded meat plates to sour ash soups to its use of rose in everything. It is also very much a work in progress. Food shows up before drink orders are taken. Drink orders take ages to arrive. Crumbs and errant splotches of mint-oil-infused eggplant puree (pretty delicious stuff) can sit on the table for uncomfortably long periods of time before things are wiped clean. Tahdig, sold separately from the saffron rice (as is the norm), exhibits the texture of a plastic toy.',\n",

Alikhani’s cooking also serves as a vital counterpoint to the city’s larger Middle Eastern culinary scene, where the diverse foodways of the Muslim majority region are often filtered through the lenses of Israeli-born chefs like Einat Admony, Meir Adoni, and Eyal Shani.',\n",

       "  '“I wouldn’t have known this was Italian-American food if you hadn’t told me,” a companion admitted during a meal here, which means Don Angie is doing what so many other cuisines are allowed to do: surprise (and challenge) diners just a little bit, and by doing so, evolve.',\n",
       "  'Once upon a time, New York had another Don Angie of sorts. Its name was Torrisi, and it opened in 2010. It was a tiny tasting spot that sought a freeform future for red sauce fare, serving up dishes that both celebrated Italian-American cooking and exalted New York multiculturalism. There were high-end riffs on Manhattan clam chowder, Cantonese-style chicken oysters, Jamaican beef patty ragus, and Manischewitz-glazed lamb chops. ',\n",
       "  'As a sequel, the team behind Torrisi opened the more retro-minded Carbone, embracing the traditions of yesteryear, reinterpreting postwar Italian-American chophouses through better techniques, better ingredients, stratospheric prices, and scattered Godfather and Goodfellas references. It wouldn’t take too long for Carbone to pop up elsewhere, in Las Vegas and Hong Kong, just as Olive Garden expanded to Mexico City and Kuwait. Torrisi, in turn, would close after five years. Like it so often does, nostalgia won out over more forward-looking innovation.',\n",
       "  'Don Angie picks up where Torrisi left off; Rito was a longtime chef at that tasting-menu restaurant. And while the digs are decidedly old-school — rounded archways, warm lighting, checkered floors — the high levels of acid and global influences make the venue the Italian-American equivalent of a French neobistro. That is to say: The chefs took a staid genre, updated it, internationalized it, refined dishes here and there, but kept everything pretty affordable. ',\n",
       "  'Clockwise from top left: The dining room at Don Angie; pepperoni fried rice with squid; the restaurant’s summertime sidewalk patio; a chrysanthemum caesar salad',\n",
       "  'This type of smart creativity isn’t what one expects from the operator: Quality Branded, a group known for its reliable food yet somewhat gimmicky flourishes, be it Park Avenue, a restaurant that changes its decor with the seasons, or Quality Italian, whose kitchen Tacinelli and Rito oversee as well. At that latter venue, the duo earned a certain degree of fame (or notoriety?) for grinding up chicken and frying it up into the shape of a parm pizza for, like, $60.',\n",
       "  'Don Angie’s subversions are more studied. Prosciutto with melon — the sweet-salty staple of hotel conference buffets — finds new life here thanks to toasted hazelnuts, for crunch, and tamarind, for pucker. The chefs reimagine Caesar salad, a dish created by an Italian immigrant living in Mexico, by swapping out the lettuce for a canopy of herbaceous chrysanthemum. When finished with Parmesan, the dish packs the fluffy texture of cotton candy.  ',\n",
       "  'Rito and Tacinelli send out snapper tartare hidden under a layer of raw trumpet mushrooms, Ignacio Mattos style, amping up the fungi flavors of a tart porcini dashi. ',\n",
       "  'And they throw together a superb fried rice, lacing the grains with pepperoni, charring the bottom layer like a Spanish paella, and topping it all off with a silky mound of seared calamari. The dish reflects an understanding of Italian-American fare that recalls the way Empellon’s Alex Stupak approaches Mexican cuisine; it’s not so much a classically elevated preparation as it is a take on red sauce fare as a larger set of ideas. ',\n",
       "  'Italian-American restaurants have long been some of the city’s toughest tables, from the aforementioned Carbone in Greenwich Village to Rao’s in East Harlem. “More or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club,” Pete Wells wrote in his two-star review early this spring. Reservations still book up well in advance, but walk-ins are usually accommodated at the bar in under 45 minutes or so, a wait that will admittedly lengthen when the patio closes for the winter. ',\n",
       "  'One could easily justify any sort of wait, quite frankly, for Don Angie’s cantaloupe caramelle. The kitchen takes black and yellow dough — as vivid as the colors of a Pittsburgh Steelers uniform — and cuts it into oblong dumplings, stuffing each sachet with buffalo milk ricotta and twisting the ends like old-fashioned candy bar wrappers. The dairy oozes out from the caramelle when pierced, softening the agrodolce rush of a pickled cantaloupe sauce. The pairing recalls a 1980s-style blend of cottage cheese and fruit, taken to Michelin-worthy heights. My companion called it a failed experiment. I call it perfect.',\n",
       "  'Equally stunning are the sopressini with smoked mussels, the folds of pasta slicked with an electric emulsion of pimenton, anchovy sauce, lime, Sriracha, and cilantro. One could turn the sauce into a sandwich spread and it would taste no less refined.',\n",
       "  'For mains: Skip the shell steak, burdened under a layer of confit lemon thick enough to count as cake frosting. Better is the orata, sitting in a pool of Mexican-style guajillo oil, lending just a gentle flicker of smoke. Veal da pepi, perhaps the city’s best rendition of Milanese, exhibits layers of flavor and texture that would wow a tempura chef. The softness of the meat, the crunch of the fry, the saltiness of the prosciutto topping, and the deep, rich flavors of carraway are a rare hat tip to tradition here.',\n",
       "  'In addition to a few standard desserts — a mascarpone-heavy tiramisu, a zeppole with honey — there’s something that looks precisely like a ball of mozzarella with olive oil. As if. In this little bit of trompe l’oeil, the chefs mold house-made mochi around obscenely milky fior di latte gelato. This classic Japanese pairing of rice flour and ice cream is often stretchy and edible with one’s hands — not too dissimilar, in theory, from fresh mooz. Problem is, Don Angie serves it at a temperature so low it requires a bit of knife-and-fork action. It evokes cheese that’s spent too much time in the fridge. That’s a small gripe, however, for a dish that essentially manages to reinvent mozzarella. Sometimes a risk is more exhilarating than perfect execution or deference to tradition. That’s a lesson more Italian-American spots could learn.',\n",

       "  'Who doesn’t love hash? Though the term is originally French, this mince-up of meat morsels is common to many culinary cultures as a method of using scraps and leftovers. One of the tastiest comes from the island of Luzon in the Philippines, home to the capital of Manila. Dubbed sisig, it started out as a tart papaya salad in the 18th century (“sisigan” means “to make it tart” in Tagalog), but by the 20th century, it was being fabricated with finely minced pig-head and liver. According to one story, this version was invented by local Filipinos using pig parts discarded by cooks at an American Air Force base in Angeles City.',\n",
       "  'True story or not, sisig exploded in popularity after World War II, when the larders of the country expanded, and cooks began using other main ingredients. When the dish came to be served in a hot cast-iron skillet as a favorite street food, an alliterative modifier was added and “sizzling sisig” was born. Its popularity here in America only increased when Anthony Bourdain lauded it as a drinking snack: “I think sisig is perfectly positioned to win the hearts and minds of the world as a whole…exactly what you need after a few beers.”',\n",
       "  'Mama Fina’s House of Filipino Sisig seems intent on fulfilling that promise. This new Alphabet City restaurant is a branch of an Elmwood Park, New Jersey mainstay that opened in 2004. Occupying the former Moonstruck Eatery on Avenue A just south of 11th Street, the bar and dining room have been decorated with Philippine fork art: rustic pottery, sculptures made from screws and bolts, and peacock serving trays of inlaid tropical woods. Ornate wrought-iron lamps, flagstone floor, and weathered wood walls also fill the space.',\n",
       "  'Chef Aming Sta Maria (pronounced “Santa Maria”) is responsible for a bill of fare that offers six sizzling sisigs ($17 each). There’s the pork prototype, of course, which she makes not with pig head but with pork belly, which includes crackling skin and plenty of meat and fat, delivered to the table sputtering. The squid sisig outdoes it in the crunch department, though chopped so fine it’s difficult to make out individual pieces of mollusk. The tofu sisig boasts a nicely browned dice of firm bean curd, lots of purple onions, and a white gravy that tastes like coconut milk and mayo, though there’s no actual coconut in it. But we’ll never really know what’s in it, because the sisig recipes are Sta Maria’s carefully guarded secret.',\n",
       "  'Chicken sisig isn’t as good because the chicken registers as limp and bland compared with the other key ingredients. If you want chicken, go for the menu section called Philippine Barbecue. Chicken wings grilled till the skin is smoky and partly blackened is painted with a peanut sauce that owes less to peanut butter and more to barbecue sauce. It comes with a vinegary dip and a mound of java rice, which is orange with turmeric and slightly spicy.',\n",
       "  'My favorite dish also deploys peanuts. Kare-kare ($24) is an oxtail stew with thick peanut gravy, which exudes flavors of garlic and onions, savory without a trace of sweetness. Bonus green beans and okra are flung on top; mix them in or pick them off to eat separately, as you wish. Among the other massive feeds is crispy pata, a heap of roast pork piled helter skelter on a tray, a perfect dish for those who like to poke among the fragments for the fattiest or crispest pieces. This dish would be equally at home in a Greenpoint Polish restaurant.',\n",

Laing is a mound of coarsely chopped taro leaves in thick coconut milk, with several shrimp riding shotgun on top. Langka is a similar dish, made with jackfruit, a starchy football that gets tossed with chunks of pork in coconut sauce. This pairing is particularly interesting, because unripe jackfruit is sometimes thought of as a pork substitute. The color of the dish is an arresting shade of off-white.',\n",

The flan is firm and nicely coated with burnt sugar syrup, the fried bananas known as turon might be mistaken for lumpia until you bite into them, but best of all is halo-halo ($12), a shaved ice speckled with seemingly random ingredients like red beans and kernel corn in a sweet syrup.

And yet in 2018, the restaurant’s most Matrix-like mind-bender of a dish is somehow the humble chicken drumstick. ',\n",
       "  'The chicken is fried four times, at rigorous two-minute intervals, in a slurry of cornstarch, flour, vodka, and beer. It is re-battered in between each fry, and finished with a brushing of mirin, yuzu, and green Tabasco. What the chef places in front of you, on a gray ceramic plate, isn’t so much a normal drumstick as it is a puffy, golden, Yogi-Bear-picnic-basket fantasy of what a chicken wing should look like. ',\n",
       "  'The drumstick is cold. This is by design. Generations of humans have enjoyed chilled fried chicken in more familiar environs — one thinks of a Sunday picnic in a grassy park — but it’s hard to think of a refrigerator bird with this much crunch. The firm skin shatters like a Butterfinger bar, while the sweet-spicy-citrusy glaze, an American take on yuzu kosho, counteracts all the salty fats of the meat. ',\n",
       "  'Normally, the price of a meal at Ko is $255, reservations only. The quadruple-fried wing, however, is only available in Ko’s new a la carte bar room, where it sells for just $7, walk-ins only.',\n",
       "  'Ten years ago, as the U.S. economy slipped into its longest downward spiral since World War II, Chang opened the original Ko on First Avenue. With an $85 menu, it felt like a permanent recession special of a restaurant — at least by fancypants standards. The chef, barely 30, was already a legend for redefining ambitious American cuisine as affordable, Asian-accented small plates at his nearby Ssäm Bar. ',\n",
       "  'But Ko’s nose-thumbing at the haute establishment was even bolder. Everything about the place was (classically) wrong: the cramped counter seating, the expletive-spewing chefs, the alt-rock soundtrack, the fried McDonald’s-style apple pies, the online-only reservations. It felt as if the Ko revolution would democratize fine dining forever. ',\n",
       "  'It would not. In fact, there’s never been a worse time in the past decade to seek out accessible luxury than now. ',\n",
       "  'New York is still one of the U.S.’s culinary capitals, but the Changian notion of democratized fine dining has proved illusory. Once-approachable tasting joints (Aska, Brooklyn Fare, Atera) have skyrocketed into the upper stratosphere of prices. Major Food Group pivoted from $50 set menus at Torrisi Italian Specialties (RIP) to power spots so expensive they don’t even publish the prices online. And what’s replacing those more reasonable-ish venues? Nothing, really; dinner at any one of the city’s dozen or so new omakase joints will easily run $350-plus per person.',\n",
       "  'Momofuku Ko, in turn, relocated to a larger space off the Bowery, adopted more refined dishes (RIP fried apple pies), and eventually started charging roughly $1,000 for a wine-paired dinner for two. I awarded it four stars in 2015; it’s without question one of the city’s great restaurants. But in this rich person’s playland that is contemporary New York, Ko’s evolution meant that cash-strapped gourmands had lost a sanctuary.',\n",

       "  'The crepe ($8) is made from from the same sourdough starter that fuels the bread service in the main room. Here, it imparts the savory pastry with such a remarkable tang it recalls the acidity of injera. The grilling gives it a distinct sweetness and a chew not dissimilar to a fruit roll-up, while a brushing of aged butter adds a marked cheesy funk. There is no other bread course in the city like it. ',\n",
       "  'It’s also hard to think of a New York dish comparable to the tandoori firefly squid. Cooks sear the torpedo-shaped creatures — they look like miniaturized beasts from a Guillermo del Toro flick — in a blend of coriander, paprika, garlic, onions, and soy. They exhibit a handsome bronze hue and pack the flavors of smoke and brine — with a bit of squishiness thanks to their oceanic guts. Equally stunning is the chaud-froid of shrimp. Gray rips the shells off of raw spot prawns, dredges the slithery bodies through a sambal-spiked gelee, then tops them off with the fried head, a warm, crunchy counterpoint to all the cool crustacean creaminess.',\n",

At the moment, chef Gray’s food is modern American-French-Japanese with nods to South and Southeast Asia, all served in a style that’s more refined and a touch more expensive than Ssäm Bar. Most dishes on the 16-item menu, written in hand in a cute little notebook, are under $35. That’s not a bad price for what’s nearly a four-star meal.',\n",

That’s a heck of a mission statement; fine dining empires typically begin their innovations in more upscale environs, only later letting them trickle down to the masses. Grant Achatz’s famous black-truffle explosion, now available for $18 in the Time Warner Center, started as a bite at the $500-per-person Alinea. And Wolfgang Puck’s smoked-salmon pizza, not an uncommon sight at his airport kiosks, started its lifespan at his once uber-exclusive Spago.',\n",

       "  'One night at Ko’s bar, halibut arrived in a dashi with soybeans. Garnishing the fillet was a confit of the fish’s own skin and cheeks, cooked down with pepperoncini and sumac. The chewy bits were mahogany in color and packed the smoky, umami richness of reconstituted bonito flakes. A few nights later the same fish came as a round cake, laced with verdant chiles and slathered in a cauliflower porridge that somehow tasted like daikon. ',\n",

Except this was a humble pie joint — Una Pizza Napoletana. The baker was Anthony Mangieri. The ingredients were imported from Italy. And the recipe for the naturally leavened dough was “handed down by the gods,” Clurfeld wrote.',\n",
       "  'Mangieri, alas, would shutter his first pizzeria. He relocated to the East Village in 2004, at a time when the city’s top pizzerias were Brooklyn stalwarts known less for showcasing top-tier products and more for following their own traditions. But the crowds came to Una, paying $17 for the margherita. In 2009 Times critic Frank Bruni called the cherry tomato pizza the city’s best — less than two weeks before Una 2.0 unexpectedly served its final pies. Mangieri was moving Una again, this time to San Francisco. His priest performed mass at the restaurant on opening night. He initially charged $20 for his creations, eventually upping the price to $25. When he closed it last year to move back to New York, local food writers penned eulogies whose tones suggested the premature death of a beloved humanitarian.',\n",
       "  'It’s hard to think of any extant pizzaiolo, other than Chris Bianco, who has been the subject of such critical praise over the past two decades. And it’s almost impossible to think of a single other American chef who, instead of building a small empire, has chosen to live the life of a solo craftsman, closing his successful restaurants whenever he moves. This is what brings us to the Lower East Side, where Mangieri has partnered with chefs and restaurateurs Fabian von Hauske and Jeremiah Stone to open Una 4.0. It’s with a nod toward statistical probability, rather than cynicism, that one supposes it might not last forever. ',\n",
       "  'And it’s with a nod toward reality that one realizes his pies aren’t as good as they should be, not at $25 apiece, and not in the crowded, experimental, ingredient-obsessed, regionally focused pizza biosphere that is contemporary New York.',\n",
       "  'Una’s new digs suggest a futuristic diner crossed with a place of worship. There are stark white walls, black floor tiles, bare brown tabletops, emerald green chairs that fall over easily if you lean back, gray screens arranged in Mondrian-like patterns, and a pizza oven spitting fire from behind a glass partition. How sepulchral. Mangieri stands behind that partition, making pies. Patrons watch as he molds the dough, applies the toppings, and pours olive oil from a copper cruet. He uses a metal peel to methodically rotate the pies in his oven, momentarily lifting them (to even out the cooking) before extricating them from the flames. ',\n",
       "  'His movements are efficient, elegant, hypnotic. And his bread is without equal among the city’s Neapolitan spots. The pie’s outer rim is as fluffy as a fresh doughnut, releasing steam when torn. The crust is only gently blistered, with a subtle sourdough tang. It’s the stuff Mangieri puts on top of that pie — subpar imported mozzarella, too much parsley, uneven salt — that often make the main event a letdown, however. Such an oversight would’ve been a problem of critical proportions under any other variant of Una, where only the only items up for grabs were Mangieri’s four or five pies, plus beer or wine.',\n",
       "  'But Una 4.0 spreads its risk, boasting a slightly longer menu that bookends the baking with starters and sweets. If one were to rank things, the chief reasons to visit are, in this order: the ice cream, the tiramisu, the small plates, the natural wines, the three tomato pizza, the marinara pie, the cherry tomato pie, the air conditioning, and then the margherita, which you can quite frankly skip. This Lower East Side spot, in other words, generally functions better as a modern Von Hauske and Stone restaurant than a classically minded Mangieri joint. ',\n",
       "  'Ice cream is among the chief summertime draws of any tristate pizza parlor, and so it’s worth noting that Von Hauske’s are among the city’s most electric. For the plain vanilla variety, he laces the dessert with a sucker punch of sodium, leaving an aftertaste that recalls the salty milk at the bottom of a bowl of corn flakes. For pistachio, he uses a Turkish paste that balances the product’s deep nuttiness with its heady perfume. And for all his ice creams, he builds his bases without egg, spinning equal parts cream and milk from Five Acre farms, resulting in a dairy drop kick so concentrated it almost tastes malted. ',\n",
       "  'One wouldn’t be faulted for dropping by Una for just for dessert — any dessert. Von Hauske brings life to the tired staple that is panna cotta by decorating it like a birthday cake, garnishing the outer rim with a fragrant ring of strawberries that have been sliced, whipped, and juiced. He also serves a rum- and Cynar-laced tiramisu, dense with ladyfingers and mascarpone, in a chalice, giving this kingly and complex confection the regal serving device it deserves. ',\n",
       "  'Starters, compliments of Stone, are equally destination-worthy, even if they’re more in loose conversation with the concept of a pizzeria than a kowtow to the form. The chef cuts raw filet mignon into thick strips and showers them in olives, pistachios, and a carbonara’s worth of parmesan. He uses ceci not in a chickpea salad, but rather to surround a circle of yuzukosho-spiked raw lobster, a wickedly delicious tartare. To channel pepperoni, he spreads spicy ’nduja sausage on a plate, topping it off with rounds of watery turnip and peppery nasturtium leaves; the effect evokes an edible version of Wassily Kandinsky’s abstract circles. ',\n",
       "  'Some will find such appetizer experimentalism to be incongruous with traditional pizzas. I’d counter that it’s a valiant study in how refinement and rusticity, artistry and craft, deserve to coexist. Why? Because when I’m swigging back a honeyed Tokaji or frothy lambrusco, the fact that these small plates seem to belong to a separate restaurant take a back seat to a more important reality: They’re delicious. ',\n",
       "  'If only Mangieri’s pizzas — particularly the toppings — were as reliably delicious as those at Razza, Roberta’s, Sullivan Street, and so many other spots that charge $7-$12 less. Una’s filetti pie, to be fair, is still impressive, with the gorgeously pulpy cherry tomatoes acting as foil to a pile of (not terribly milky) buffalo mozzarella. The margherita, somewhat creamy on certain nights, can suffer from curds as flavorless as Polly-O string cheese on other evenings; Mangieri occasionally uses cheese so low in moisture its tastes like saline rubber. ',\n",
       "  'His marinara pie is more smartly composed, with a layer of fragrant garlic and olive oil yielding to the gentle fragrance of San Marzanos. The fruit doesn’t boast the compelling acidity or assertive aroma found in comparable pies around town; this is a more restrained study in the tomatoes’ complexity. Sometimes this is maddening; you often need to close your eyes and concentrate to divine the nature of these tomatoes. And sometimes, for just a bite or two, it all comes together; the pulp mixes with a salt crystal, resulting in a concoction as aromatic as rose.',\n",
       "  'Then on another night the marinara is underseasoned. So you ask for salt. A waiter shakes his head. This decision, for a nanosecond, is understandable. One wouldn’t walk into an opera house and tell the soprano to sing louder — but there’s something to be said for using a hearing aid. For some, salt is that hearing aid for flavor. Even at the city’s most expensive sushi parlors, chefs often give diners a tiny ramekin of shoyu, just in case. It’s a nice act of humility, and a comparable gesture at Una would go a long way given that dinner for one (a starter, a pizza, a dessert, two drinks) can run nearly $100 after tax and tip. ',\n",

Pink grapefruit segments and candied cherry blossoms bob in the distilled spirit, a harbinger of the boozy night that will ensue. On another page, a shrimp and hot-pepper pancake is shot from overhead, an angle that flattens the jeon’s intensely briny and spicy nooks and crannies, almost giving it the illusion of being stenciled on its blue-and-white plate.

Some items receive museum style-captions; there are short history lessons on the origins of gochugaru spice paste and army stews. Fanned-out slices of pig belly are advertised in all-caps fonts that would be fit for a wartime billboard. “HAN’S PORK WILL FATTEN YOUR SOUL!” ',\n",
       "  'None of this feels like a standard bill of fare as much as a gift guide from a high-end retailer.

       "  'Or put more practically, the menu’s clever photography acts as an unspoken guide to why certain dishes are so spectacular. Consider the bulgogi. The camera gets in close on the minced short-rib patty, the surface glistening with moisture, the craggy edges burnished from the grill. I daydreamed about the gorgeous char before it arrived — and when it did, on a scorching cast-iron pan, the bulgogi turned out to be perfectly seared, crunchy, and packed with notes of sugar, sesame, and soy. When I close my eyes and picture it, what I see first is the photo. ',\n",
       "  'As certain stretches of the city continue to suffer from strains of gastronomic ennui (“oh boy, another New American hotel restaurant”), the ascendency of modern Korean fare has become one of the more energizing trends in New York, from the tasting-menu-only Jungsik to the experimental small plates of Oiji to the ramyun wonders of Jeju to the bovine barbecue bombshell that is Cote. Lee himself helped fuel this zeitgeist with Take 31, which hawks Havana-style corn cakes, radish kimchi jambalaya, and banana-flavored rice beer (his hospitality company, HAND, also collaborates with the sleek Korean Atoboy).',\n",
       "  'The more classical Han doesn’t so much represent a refutation of this trend as a stylish counterpoint to it. The nearly three-year-old venue, next door to Take 31, elicits most of its thrills via more traditional means: homestyle shared plates, stews, and one of the city’s better fried chickens. This is all contrasted, gently, by that Ethan Allen catalogue of a menu, as well as the the requisite brick walls, neon signage, exposed filament light bulbs, antlers, and bric-a-brac on bookshelves.

Chef NamHyung Woo cuts up raw crab and douses it in enough garnet spice paste to make the crustacean look like a drippy Christmas ornament. The best way to eat the staple dish, called yangnyeom gejang, is however the heck you can, but this critic advises slurping the grey, slippery meat out of the shell and enjoying the gentle brininess before the full heat assault takes over (tamer types can scoop out the meat with a spoon).

The bird lacks any of the garlic or chile sauces so frequently associated with Korean-style fries. It’s just plain fried chicken that’s sufficiently juicy, crispy, and brined, with a touch of sweetness, and a wallop of concentrated poultry flavor.

Additionally, the country was colonized by Spain and France. All these influences come into focus in a subtle and sometimes playful cuisine.',\n",

Two welcoming benches sit out front.',\n",

The bill of fare is short, offering only four apps, three sides, and six versions of couscous, plus specials.

In many Moroccan restaurants, it arrives studded with lamb, chicken, and merguez, dubbed “royal couscous.” In truth, these couscouses are often dry as blown desert sand.',\n",
       "  'At Kish-Kash, the chef and her minions endlessly fuss over it, steaming and re-steaming. Despite the small size of the couscous she deploys — the couscous, which represents crushed durum wheat semolina, is available in dozens of diameters — the result is memorably moist, and not the least bit sloppy.',\n",
       "  'The implement she uses is known as a kish-kash, which consists of a pair of pots, one poised over the other. With the brilliant couscous produced therein, the main courses fall into place. Foremost is the aforementioned chicken tagine ($15), which pairs another famous Moroccan dish, a stew often cooked in a clay vessel called a tagine, with the couscous. A plump bird is roasted with green olives, preserved lemons, and caramelized onions, producing a winning pungency with a citric edge.',\n",
       "  'Another spectacular couscous is mafrum, a recipe often attributed to Libya that features a hollowed-out potato filled with spicy ground beef. The chef further tosses rankly potato sticks on top of the spud to add crunch. I could eat this spectacular comfort food every day. Equally good is chraime ($19), a fish fillet in a limpid tomato sauce crowned with pepper. The dish is hot but not too hot.',\n",
       "  'In the second tier of desirable couscous at Kish-Kash, but still well worth ordering, stand tbecha (short rib, on one occasion a bit tough), chunky lamb (simultaneously chewy and tender), and Moroccan vegetables of the squash, carrot, and turnip sort, shotgunned with chickpeas. For once, the dish didn’t seem like a torture arranged for vegetarians, and I’d gladly order this again, especially considering the $12 price tag.',\n",

There’s a great hummus ($9) flavored with chermoula, a green relish of chopped parsley and cilantro and presented with seeded challah bread, which arrives in a paper bag with the edges turned back. No cardboard pitas here. There’s also a cauliflower smothered in tahini, a brilliant salad featuring greens and sliced avocado in a lemony dressing, and deep fried eggplant.',\n",
       "  'Another charming aspect of the menu is the three sides, priced at $3 each: a crushed and brightly flavored orange squash, stewed tomatoes, and lemon-pickled vegetables. Individually or in concert, they add extra zing to your plate of couscous.',\n",
       "  'Several things make Kish-Kash particularly appealing. One is the couscous itself, rendered more perfectly than in any other New York establishment; I’ve only tasted couscous this good in Morocco. Second, the limited menu encourages you to zone in on your favorite version of the dish and make it your regular order. Alternately, if you happen to be there with a table of friends, it’s well within the realm of reason to order all the starters and all the sides to enjoy a sumptuous banquet.',\n",
       "  'And with its small size, cheery demeanor, commendable service, and relatively low prices (one can dine well for $25), Kish-Kash feels like a new type of restaurant, hopefully spawning imitators who strike a similar note with different cuisines.

The culinary style traces its mouth-stinging lineage to Jamaica; it developed in the 1700s as a fusion between the pit-cooking techniques of escaped West African slaves and the native Taino spice rubs designed to prevent meat spoilage. ',\n",
       "  'The question of exactly what jerk is in the 21st century, however, has become “open for interpretation,” Island & Spice editor Rochelle Oliver wrote for the Times in July. “Is it a flavor? Is it the ingredients? Is it the way the meat is cooked? The truth lies somewhere in the middle,” she argued. In Jamaica, jerk typically involves seasoning whole hogs or chicken with a pungent mix of ingredients that grow in the island nation’s verdant interior: scallions, thyme, allspice, and chiles. The meats are then slowly smoked over resinous pimento branches, either underground or in a steel drum. In New York, this is the style loosely employed by LoLo’s in Harlem and Glady’s in Crown Heights and, as of this spring, in Prospect-Lefferts — more on that later enterprise in a bit.',\n",
       "  'Cooking with hardwood fuel, alas, requires expensive ventilation systems and emissions filters. That means jerking in the city often means forgoing the smoker in favor of a gas grill or oven. Miss Lily’s in Manhattan, which sells a bird that tastes like any backyard chicken, is an example of how to do this New York style of jerking poorly. Peppa’s is an example of how to do it expertly.',\n",
       "  'Kingston-born Gavin Hussey is the person to thank here. He opened the first Peppa’s just south of Prospect Park in 2004 and has since expanded the business with his brother Jason and his daughter Jessica, who share ownership. A Crown Heights location opened in 2016, followed by a Peppa’s near Brownsville later that year. The Hussey family is striking while the iron is hot; fast-casual chicken concepts are proliferating, from David Chang’s Fuku to Seamus Mullen’s Whirlybird to the poultry-centric Made Nice. Peppa’s is better. ',\n",
       "  'The Crown Heights location, the subject of this inquiry, is the only one with seating. And like all the other locations, there are a few non-chicken items, including a pile of goat curry, gorgeously funky with gelatinous meat and thick gravy and a sweet stewed oxtail over coconut rice.',\n",
       "  'But really, you’ve come here for the chicken. The meat is scored, washed in vinegar, marinated overnight in a rub whose ingredients no one would reveal to me, and grilled for approximately 45 minutes. Certain bites pack a clean poultry tang; others are earthy and woodsy from the flames. The skin comes off with ease, yielding to a gentle chew like a charred campfire marshmallow. The hot sauce causes your tongue to tingle or five minutes afterwards, maybe six. You dampen the heat with a forkful of coconut rice, or a sweet, craggy festival — essentially sweet, fried cornbread. The near-perfect jerk here is the type of preparation that calls into question spending $60 on a chicken for two at a passable brasserie, or $10 on the bland, overcooked birds at Whole Foods. ',\n",
       "  'Peppa’s is a chain worth rooting for.',\n",
       "  'Strolling by the sophomore location of Glady’s, on the corner of Lincoln Road and Rogers Avenue, means inhaling the heady aroma of smoldering wood. That scent is chef Junior Felix’s beacon. For nearly half a decade, Michael Jacober, a Rhode Island native not of West Indian descent, has been the unlikely public face of the popular Caribbean restaurant. But with the opening of the Prospect-Lefferts outpost this spring, Jacober has stepped back, letting the chef, a native St. Lucian who’s been involved in virtually every recipe Glady’s has ever developed, oversee the space as a co-owner. ',\n",
       "  'Felix ensures that anything carrying the name jerk is jerked the classic way: via a sauna of fragrant smoke. He prepares all the meats over a custom smoker that sits behind the counter, a rectangular steel edifice built by a guy called Alabama Joe. He cooks pork and chicken at 275 degrees for about 2.5 hours — hotter and faster than most American ’cue. The wood selection, in turn, departs a bit from Jamaican traditions. Felix uses a mix of domestic maple and ash, alongside traditional pimento chips, which impart a flavor that some liken to bay leaves.',\n",
       "  'The jerk, sweet and vaguely piney with expertly rendered fats, calibrated heat, and bracing pungency, is so good that Glady’s is as much in conversation with Peppa’s as it is with a place like Hometown or Mighty Quinn’s. The comparison is important. There’s long been a tendency to overcategorize affordable or unfamiliar foodstuffs, to relegate them to a series of polite “best of brackets” rather than to critique them within the larger context of the city’s dining traditions. And so in the case of Glady’s, its place within the jerk community is just one story; the bigger picture is that it’s one of the the city’s most accomplished barbecue restaurants. And Felix is without question one of New York’s top pitmasters.',\n",
       "  'Warning: The Prospect-Lefferts sequel doesn’t have the same frenetic, the-waitlist-is-full, everyone’s-cramped-together-jerk-eating energy as the original location. The space here is larger and emptier. There is no wait and there are no waiters; the new Glady’s is counter-service only. And the design ethos is technicolor eclectic with wood-paneled benches, cushy teal banquettes, crimson flooring, orange pressed-tin walls, outdoor picnic tables, and church-like stained glass windows. ',\n",
       "  'My prediction is that the crowds will pick up for a very basic reason: the food is better here than at the original. Glady’s 1.0 cooks with a combi-oven, an expensive device that lets Felix bombard his meats with wet heat, dry heat, and the pleasant fumes of wood chips. The proper smoker at Glady’s 2.0, by contrast, makes a noticeable difference, imbuing the chicken ($9.50) with a deeper mahogany hue. That exterior is wonderfully leathery, a toothsome counterpart to the soft meat. The flavor is all sweet smoke at first — the poultry flavor isn’t as assertive as at Peppa’s — followed by the clove-like warmth of the allspice berry and then bucking heat of the Scotch bonnet. The tongue vibrates in such a way that recalls good Sichuan fare.',\n",
       "  'You quell the pain with a Pinata, a bracingly tart slush of mezcal, grapefruit, and lime, or a Kid Kreyol, a perfumed blend of Haitian rums, lime, honey and guava. Shannon Mustipher is the mind behind these creations; she’s one of the rare restaurant bartenders who can put together a list of drinks that’s simultaneously original, well-balanced, and food-friendly. The painkiller ($10), that classic mix of rum, coconut cream, lime, and nutmeg, is somewhat sugary on its own, and rightly so. It counters the aggressive salting and sharp aromas of Felix’s jerk pork ($9.50). On some nights the swine’s fats are pleasantly chewy; on other nights they’re softer and more rendered, with a flesh that evokes tender jerky. ',\n",
       "  'Guyanese chow mein — ramen tossed in soy and sesame — is a good way to keep from overloading on the luscious proteins, even if it omits the traditional egg noodles. For flavors that are lighter on both salt and smoke, the goat curry serves as a study in using coconut milk to convey the musky flavors of the ruminant and the gentle heat of habanero. Jacober tells me he’ll soon start exporting the Jerk Center meats to the flagship, but for now, the Prospect-Lefferts location is the Glady’s to visit. May there be more Caribbean restaurants.',\n",

       "  'At Frenchette, Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson’s sleek Tribeca hotspot, something unusual happens while patrons engage in the dreaded ritual of waiting for seats at a packed bar: A server walks up, presents a menu, and takes your drink order on the spot. No credit cards are requisitioned. No one behind the bar is summoned. And a few minutes later a waiter returns with, say, a Calvados and tonic — a bitter, boozy, apple-tinged highball — or a fizzy glass of sparkling gamay. ',\n",
       "  'The quiet courtesy lets guests focus on what’s important, which is contemplating the list of natural wines or the menu of creative Gallic fare — uni deviled eggs, anyone? — rather than forcing them to flag down a bartender or shout past fellow patrons. It’s the type of generosity that makes one think: Maybe Frenchette is worth the hour-long wait.',\n",
       "  '“Bad food is always more tolerable than bad service.” That’s one of the axioms of hospitality industry thinking, as well as a brilliant explainer as to why your grandparents’ burnt meatloaf always manages to please: because it’s served with love! And the good news is that service, in the mechanical sense of getting stuff to a table in a timely fashion, is generally practiced at a high level throughout the city. ',\n",
       "  'But a larger goal of hospitality — making guests feel warm and welcome in an unfamiliar environment where they’ll spend a lot of money — is a trickier affair. Nasr and Hanson are more skilled than the overseers at other fashionable hangouts at creating a sense of belonging, a heck of a thing given that the duo hail from Minetta Tavern, a Keith McNally restaurant whose earliest days were a classic example of how not to treat humans.',\n",
       "  'Frenchette’s cocktail service is part of the feel-good equation. Another part is that the hosts seem genuinely excited to see guests at the door. And then there’s the fact that walk-ins aren’t just encouraged, they get about a third of the restaurant’s 105 seats; there are few better ways to make a first-time patron feel excluded than by telling them a nominally approachable cafe or brunch spot books up weeks out.',\n",
       "  'Hospitality is vital anywhere, but particularly clutch here, as it creates a safety net for a style of gastronomy that’s sometimes a standard deviation removed from the brasserie norm. Instead of shrimp cocktail, the kitchen sends out warm spot prawns tossed in thyme and butter; guests are instructed to eat the entire crustacean, chomping through a shell that shatters like the crisp exterior of a kouign amann. And scrambled eggs, as rich as creme anglaise, come topped not with truffles but a tiny pile of sautéed snails, amping up the buttery fats and adding an umami-studded chew. ',\n",
       "  'These are the types of dishes that make it tough to be dismissive of Frenchette, that make it hard to ask whether “we need another self-consciously luxurious brasserie, in a city so full of them,” as another critic wrote. The truth is that Nasr and Hanson have given New York something decidedly different. They’ve built a modern French spot in conversation with the ambitiously lean neo-bistros of Paris, a venue whose culinary exploits can feel closer to a creative small plates place than a more staid institution like Balthazar.',\n",
       "  'Yes, the dining room is a study in architectural riches, with red leather banquettes, white curtains, glossy sapele wood paneling, and sinuous liquor shelves that recall the space age curves of the 1960s. But in a city admittedly replete with brasseries, I can’t think of a single one dishing out ethereal fritters laced with smoked eel, or funky surf and turfs that pair oily mackerel with paper-thin veal tongue.',\n",
       "  'How many other French restaurants are grilling blowfish tails, dousing them in chile butter and letting the patrons gnaw the succulent flesh off the bone? They are the chicken wings of the sea. And they go perfectly with a glass of pet-nat, a class of wines whose bubbles are produced without the addition of yeast or sugar, as is the case with the methode traditionelle. The result is a low-ish alcohol content and a level of fizz gentler than most Champagnes.',\n",
       "  'Jorge Riera, late of Wildair, is the man behind the natural wine list, and a large reason why Frenchette is compelling as it is. The bearded beverage director roams the dining room, deciphering obscure grapes to willing imbibers, and pouring restrained reds, skin contact orange wines, and cloudy whites that sometimes boast the oxidized flavor of sherry. But what makes the wines truly special is something larger: The ever-changing selections end up forcing a more honest conversation between the guest and the waiter or sommelier.',\n",
       "  'If Minetta rose to fame as one of the city’s more expensive purveyors of dry-aged steaks and hamburgers, Frenchette seems destined to be a touch more accessible, with two of the signature red meat preparations offered at $34. The first and best is the duck frites; the kitchen takes the canard breasts and steams them, roasts them in a cage, and then crisps them up a second time on pickup. The silky fats and iron-y flesh are a welcome alternative to the working class indulgence that is steak frites, though Frenchette does a fine number on that staple as well. The chefs rotate among a series of cuts, from bavette, to onglet, to the petit tender. The last of the bunch, also known as teres major, sports the soft mouthfeel of a filet but exhibits a more robust beefiness. ',\n",
       "  'The sun-drenched flavors of the Cote D’Azur is a running theme here, which explains the fish soup — a tomato-laced misfire packing as little flavor as Campbell’s Manhattan clam chowder. Lemon- and bottarga-slicked spaghetti is a more skillful evocation of the Mediterranean, with the fragrant citrus taming the mineral overtones of the cured roe. Lamb, in turn, is broken down into the standard Provencal daube-style stew; cubes of fork tender shoulder meat sit in a summery broth of red wine and lamb jus. ',\n",
       "  'Rotisserie lobster smacks of clean ocean air; the soft meat drips with curried butter. And the $68 Sasso chicken for two easily feeds three. It’s a Thanksgiving feast of a dish, with golden skin as crispy as a hard taco shell, a crock of mushroom-spiked pommes puree redolent with the scent of maitakes, a baguette showered in tart vinegar, and a metal gravy boat filled with heady drippings. And while such carnivorous fare almost begs for a lighter dessert — there’s a fresh, sugary strawberry pavlova on the menu — pastry chef Michelle Palazzo excels in heartier endeavors.

That bit of fiction is one of the first things that came to mind while dining at Manhatta, Danny Meyer’s new French spot in the Financial District; the 60th floor digs afford such intimate views of neighboring towers that the effect is like a comic. Everything is larger than life.',\n",

A crimson puck of tarragon-laced tuna tartare, next to a few pretty lettuce leaves, serves as an inoffensive protein delivery mechanism, dissolving on the tongue without much heat or acidity. It is simply food. Cavatelli, in turn, is virtually indistinguishable from other generic pasta dishes around the city; it’s a ho-hum melange of tomato, sauce, and pecorino. It is plain nourishment.

You work your way through a roasted halibut over beans — a touch overcooked, but not dreadfully so — or pan-seared sweetbreads in a creamy blanquette sauce, the organ meats as silky and soft as fresh mozzarella. And then you continue on with your ogling of the cityscape. ',\n",
       "  'In one regard, such a setup is thoughtful; no one wants anything requiring a tableside “here’s how to eat this” speech while soaking up a once-in-a-lifetime vista. But in another sense, there’s something decidedly stodgy about the implicit premise of Manhatta, which is that diners up high almost exclusively want another safe breed of continental-American fare, another serving of flaky turbot with brown butter and capers. It’s an assumption that has governed the “dinner with a view” class for venues for decades, from the old Windows on the World to the Rainbow Room to the current offerings at One World Trade.

Bartenders caramelized drinks with blazing-hot pokers and clarified ripe bananas into rum with centrifuges and froze basil leaves with liquid nitrogen. The complex techniques and wacky flavors made it the city’s only fully experimental bar. And somehow it was also an accessible experiment, with $14 drinks, $12 ham plates, and no reservations.',\n",
       "  'It closed in 2016, but less than a year later, New York again has a modernist cocktail parlor, albeit in a slightly different latitude and altitude: the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental on Columbus Circle. The Aviary, a spinoff of the Chicago original, is the long-awaited East Coast debut from the folks behind Alinea, a world-renowned gastronomic playpen where chefs send out fried chicken liver mousse made to look like volcanic ash, and where patrons suck the helium out of green apple taffy balloons.',\n",
       "  'So it’s no surprise when The Aviary’s bartenders — a loose term, as the bar is a glass-walled kitchen — send out the following bit of whimsy: coffee-laced Manhattans in clear bags filled everything-bagel perfume. A server cuts open the bag and the scent lingers for just a second. It is only transportive in the sense that it evokes something New Yorkers eat every day for a buck. Here, that aroma and the very average mix of rye and vermouth it perfumes cost $27. ',\n",
       "  'The Aviary, alas, isn’t as accessible of an experiment as the dearly departed Booker and Dax. It is, however, a great place to Instagram cocktails, if that’s your thing.

A server pours it into a hole in the middle of the garnish tray, funneling the liquid into a small glass bowl filled with fresno pepper ice balls.

And now he’s here at The Lobster Club, whipping up spicy toro rolls completely devoid of tuna belly’s signature silky texture.

In his Letters to a Young Chef, Daniel Boulud wrote that “clientele and imagination determine what ingredients you should buy...It does not all have to be truffles, caviar, and foie gras.” His comment was prescient in that it preceded a decade-plus movement of young chefs redefining and expanding the notion of luxury as we know it, from the faux-shark’s fin soup of Benu, to the lemongrass-flavored ants of Noma, to the green apple taffy helium balloons of Alinea, to the house-made mozzarella of Torrisi.

It’s perfect, until you try it another night and the eggs are overcooked and lack their compelling richness.',\n",

Here, the bread completely overwhelms the fattiness and seasonings of the beef. It tastes like any steak sandwich. Rice laced with foie gras, the final savory course, has little of the duck liver’s signature richness; the ingredient is more oily than flavorful. The black truffles atop, in turn, lack the earthy complexity they possess elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'For a few weeks at the end of last summer, there was no better place to be in Brooklyn than Claro. In the shadow of vine-covered trellises, with a light breeze blowing off the Gowanus and cicadas humming in the trees, tables and a blue-tiled bar beckoned in the sunken backyard of what was formerly The Pines. Hunkered next to the restaurant was a wood-fired oven, where meats were grilled and flatbreads cooked on a griddle, everything emerging infused with the heady odor of smoke. To sit and enjoy a cocktail as your dinner was prepared in plain view was to experience the highest form of culinary expectation. ',\n",
       "  'And so a table of friends and I relaxed in the early evening just as the sun was setting and enjoyed a soupy shrimp ceviche known as an aguachile, a vinegary rabbit salpicon, and a mole amarillo of chicken with green romano beans in a lovely orange sauce. One of the virtues of Claro, run by chef TJ Steele, is its concentration on the food of Oaxaca, a brilliant cuisine from southern Mexico rarely seen in New York City.',\n",
       "  'The highlight of my first meal at Claro, and one enjoyed in memory days later, was the pork rib memela ($16), a hand-patted flatbread topped with shredded meat and white cheese, with just enough chile de arbol to give it zing and acidity. The outdoor kitchen — and the way it imbues smoke into dishes — certainly is an asset.',\n",
       "  'But on my following visits, some wood-fire cooked items weren’t available, though the owners say the outdoor kitchen is functional year-round. The menu had shifted around considerably. Could Claro make up for its wood oven deficit? The short answer is yes. Replacements included a heart-warming chicken consommé with masa dumplings and shredded kale that did a convincing imitation of matzo ball soup, and a chile relleno stuffed with chorizo and potato sprawled in an earthy tomato sauce. The memela menu had been expanded, and so had the range of raw fish dishes and the selection of moles, too.',\n",
       "  'Let’s look at the moles first. These represent the cooking of indigenous nations that resided in Oaxaca before Cortes arrived in the early 16th century, painstaking sauces often containing chiles, nuts, herbs, spices, and even chocolate. In fact, the most famous of these, attributed to the state of Puebla just north of Oaxaca, is often called simply “mole.” Legendarily, Oaxaca has seven moles, identified by color and each having its own special uses. These are so difficult to make that many restaurants don’t bother.',\n",
       "  'Not so at Claro. Its menu includes mole negro ($32), a thick, midnight-black sauce with just a trace of sweetness that one-ups Pueblan mole by toasting the spices first. Claro puts a duck leg in it, sprinkles sesame seeds on top, and sides it with a rotating roster of vegetables, which on my visit included delicata squash and brussels sprouts. The sprouts didn’t really belong, but who demands absolute authenticity? The other mole currently on the menu is a mole rojo (red mole) with pork cheeks. Please, Claro, more moles! ',\n",
       "  'In its post-summer menus, the restaurant has gone wild with tostadas. These crisp toasted tortilla platforms are often used in Mexico as staging areas for ceviches. Claro’s yellowfin tuna tostada ($22) is perfect in every way, pink nuggets of fish mixed with blood orange and crunchy chicharron, and so is an octopus tostada with pickled chiles and tocino, a crispy pork belly. The biggest dud on a menu that contains few is a tostada smeared with a ground Wagyu beef tartare, seasoned with the kind of gusano (worm) salt more often used on the rim of a margarita. I say bring on the insect larvae — but not in this usage.',\n",
       "  'Claro is one place where you shouldn’t ignore the desserts, even though only three are offered. Best is dulce de calabaza ($12), a wedge of well-roasted pumpkin flooded with caramel sauce and sided with thick whipped cream.

They needed a carry-able lunch to take into the fields, and the humble roti was turned into one of the world’s earliest wraps by folding it around a filling of goat, chicken, seafood, potatoes, chickpeas, or other vegetables, further seasoned with tamarind and pepper sauces.',\n",

Like Naples, Rome is a pizza town, but unlike Naples, pizzas occur in a bewildering variety of styles. There are round cracker pizzas that can break apart as you bite into them; and thicker circular pies like those of Naples, but slightly crisper. Some pizzas resemble Sullivan Street Bakery’s pizza bianca, oily and bumpy without sauce, sometimes used to make mortadella sandwiches; others are the bready focaccia squares found in bakeries, strewn with zucchini blossoms, onions, or other single ingredients.',\n",
       "  'But one of the most characteristic styles is the pinsa. Some would say it’s not really a pizza, but an oblong flop of dough rounded at either end like a huarache, perhaps originating in ancient Rome as pizza’s ancestor. The dough is different too, a mixture of grains that cooks up light and airy. To compensate for this lack of weight, the toppings are piled on with a freer hand, including unexpected meats and vegetables. Even in New York, where we’re proud of our wild and crazy pies, the pinsa seems unbound by convention.',\n",

As a result of the restaurant’s name, Camillo’s supporting liquor program is heavy on the negronis ($10). While the normal formula of this strong swizzle involves gin and Campari, one the nine available here is contrarily made with mezcal, while another features artichoke liqueur, perhaps causing the count to spin in his grave.',\n",

It makes you a bit dizzy staring up at it.',\n",
       "  'The pinsas are spectacular. Five depend on tomato sauce, while three others luxuriate in their white cheesiness. But the difficult choice this represents can be avoided: Divided down the middle, a ninth pinsa, the Romana ($15), mixes both types. On one side is a tomatoey Amatriciana sauce from the town of Amatrice in the Apennine Mountains about two hours outside of Rome, featuring funky hog jowl. The other side is spread with cacio e pepe, the peppery Pecorino sauce, another specialty of the Eternal City.',\n",
       "  'Turning pastas into pinsas is a magical idea, also seen in New York City’s ziti and lasagna pies. Other pinsas at Camillo are equally startling. My favorite is the capricciosa ($19), a wild ride of heaped-up tomatoes, olives, artichokes, mushrooms, and prosciutto cotto (baked ham). It’s like a lush open-face sandwich you might take on a picnic. Another pinsa features the very southern Italian pairing of pork sausage and broccoli rabe, and there’s also a fine vegetarian pie topped with eggplant, two types of summer squash, and oodles of onions.',\n",
       "  'If pinsas alone were the province of the restaurant, it would be a fine thing. But Camillo seeks to be a full-blown Italian restaurant, too, dotting its menu with dishes associated with Rome, as well as other quirky regional cooking from around the country. From the Roman stockyards comes coda alla vaccinara ($15), a dense ragu of boneless oxtail that dukes it out in the bowl with thick, wide, fresh pappardelle. Equally splendid are two lamb-stuffed cannelloni smothered in béchamel like mutant enchiladas.',\n",

It’s a dish usually served around New Year’s and has since disappeared from the menu, though the team says it will return next December. Meanwhile, the bowl of baby octopi awash in gritty red sauce that I didn’t much like — disappointing if you crave charred tentacles — still lingers. The best current app is anchovies on buttered toast ($8), in which dairy and carbs mellow the salty and stinky fish. Even if you don’t normally order anchovies, you’ll like these.',\n",

The one most New Yorkers will be familiar with is khachapuri acharuli ($15), which resembles a bulbous canoe filled with molten cheese. On top of the cheese, threatening to swamp the canoe, are a raw egg yolk and a knob of liquefying butter. Stir the ingredients before pulling off hunks of bread to dip in the delectable mess.',\n",

Shaped like a pizza, the bread is covered with a double layer of sulguni cheese. In fact, it’s what might be called a white pizza, only the cheese has been browned to make it chewier and more pungent. Imeruli khachapuri features two layers of dough with the cheese inside. Back in Georgia, there are at least five other variations, some featuring boiled eggs and potatoes.',\n",

The population of the country is largely Christian, rather than Muslim or Jewish, so it offers pork kebabs ($12) not available in Uzbek or Turkish establishments. These are made with fatty ground meat and come dusted with sumac. They’re also wrapped in a flatbread, so you can eat them like cylindrical sandwiches. Rice or french fries are served alongside. Pick the fab fries, which are creamy on the inside, and a perfect sienna brown on the outside.',\n",

Like Tibetan momos or Shanghai soup dumplings, these khinkali ($12 for six) are round and puckered on top like a leather coin purse. They feature a mixture of ground meats seasoned with onions and garlic. When cut into, juice often spurts out.',\n",

This honest bowl of fluffy cornmeal porridge might be mistaken for hominy grits, and to further extend the illusion, the bowl is topped with butter and cheese. Don’t miss it. Georgian is also a cuisine loaded with stews. My favorite is chakapuli, a veal casserole with a bright green broth due to fresh tarragon — which also confers a liquorice-y flavor you might love or hate. ',\n",

Unfortunately, the version at Georgian Dream is pallid, and delivers no garlic wallop, so skip it. Instead, turn to the vegetarian dishes that pack the menu.',\n",

Three compressed pucks of vegetable matter are aligned on the all-white platter: one pink, one yellow, one as green as a forest in springtime, all scattered with pomegranate seeds and fresh herbs. Green beans, beets, and spinach are the vegetables providing the colors, stuck together with a walnut, garlic, and herb puree. And you won’t find a more delectable vegan dish in Brooklyn.',\n",

But beginning in the early years of this century, tapas bars underwent a spectacular revival, with the newcomers introducing creative dishes at least partly inspired by the new Spanish cooking of Ferran Adria and his disciples, like Boqueria and Tertulia. Now a new place has opened up that proves tapas fever hasn’t abated yet.',\n",

The front half of the restaurant is a wood-accented barroom, with big doors that open onto the street, and a long bar with a fresh seafood case at one end. From that case fly langostinos a la plancha ($17), three jumbo prawns cooked on a griddle — head, antennae, beady eyes, and all. Crunch at their buttery perfection.',\n",

Overhead a printed curtain ripples, upon which a mural of gleaners wading into the surf to pull percebes (gooseneck barnacles) from the rocks is depicted, though unfortunately, the restaurant hasn’t offered them. Up a few steps, the rear dining room is more prosaic, with functional furniture, Spanish pottery in niches, and an open kitchen at the end. Both rooms feel very European.',\n",
       "  'It is in that back room that you should chow down on any of the more substantial meals known as Platos Principales. Bacalao con coliflor ($28) is the most interesting, a sizzling plate of fresh cod with potatoes and cauliflower swamped with béchamel, like a white wave breaking over rocks. Also good is macarron de la abuela, a grandmotherly dish of penne, chicken, and forest mushrooms that one-ups chicken cacciatore. Skip the risotto-like arroz caldosto ($48, for two), which is altogether too salty, sloppy, and soupy to merit the exemplary seafood washing around therein.',\n",
       "  'But really, this is not a place for a formal sit-down meal, since most of the excitement is in the four other menu sections, which concentrate on small plates, several demonstrating the quirky and unique cuisine of Galicia. Check out the tortilla de Betanzos ($10), named after a small town that was known as Carunium in Roman times. It looks like a round bouncy cushion upon which a jewel might be displayed, but when cut open, a liquid center of potatoes and egg yolk spills out. No more dry tortilla.',\n",

Foremost of all dishes that are more rare in New York is Tomiño’s take on the empanada. The restaurant offers the version most New Yorkers are familiar with, a folded and crimped pocket pie carried by Spanish mariners all over the world. But the original empanada was more of a communal pastry, a giant pie cut into pieces. Tomiño stuffs this giant pie with salt cod or chorizo and chicken, and serves it in four small rectangular pieces per order ($12).',\n",

The dish in question is frico, traditionally a humble Friulian snack of fried cheese crisps. But here, in a hip corner of Manhattan, it takes the form of a large disc of cheddar. It magically hovers above the plate, hinting at something more underneath. Is it a few slices of fatty pork jowl? Nope. The surprise is a handful of stale popcorn.

Then again, Public is a questionable name for Ian Schrager’s parent hotel; weekend rates generally start at $400 after taxes.

Prospective guests walk past a spacious yard, which is a nice place to relax under a real tree with fake leaves, past a series of Tron-themed escalators, past a gift shop hawking $600 sunglasses, and past a pastry counter that sells excellent (if slightly stale) strawberry eclairs. Those who continue to walk back will encounter the restaurant, guarded by a host who, on at least one occasion, knows to reflexively look down at his little host computer (not up to make eye contact) when a patron approaches.',\n",

Brown wood beams crisscrossed the ceiling, a handsome juxtaposition to the (plastic) ivy that hangs in the rear garden. I admired this elegant ballet before sitting down and realizing my right hand was gently sticking to the bottom of my chair, my fingers apparently coated in a veneer of someone else’s soy-ginger sauce.

',\n",
       "  'In 2017, Vongerichten is a slightly more complicated internationalist, presiding over an empire of nearly 40 establishments and concepts across the world.

Even Manhattan clam chowder, the accompaniment to grilled salmon (ordered medium rare, delivered medium well), turns out not to be actual soup, but a thin, saccharine, barely spoonable sauce of tomato and chile oil; it’s precisely the type of liquid one might expect to find scrapped off the side of a hot steel buffet.',\n",

But as restaurants around town struggle with labor costs and skyrocketing rents, the abject awfulness of Public serves as a cynical lesson for chefs who are transitioning from being brash, we-might-fail-any-day envelope-pushers to conservative middle agers.

       "  'The sandwich inspired an amusing game of critical one-upmanship. When Peter Meehan of the New York Times reviewed the Chelsea spot, he declared the oceanic panino the “sandwich of the year.” A few months later, blogger Andrea Strong wrote that the “unini,” as she called it, had taken on “legendary, if not mythical status.” Serious Eats then upgraded panino to “sandwich of the decade” in 2009, the same year the Frank Bruni cast a broader net, calling it an “era-defining treat.” ',\n",
       "  'They’re all impressive accolades for something that looked like an underbaked grilled cheese sandwich. The dish hailed from an era when restaurants didn’t calibrate visuals for social media; Instagram was still three years away and the iPhone had just debuted. ',\n",

The sweet taste of uni fills your mouth — until mustard oil kicks in and stings the sinuses; that condiment doesn’t so much cleanse the palate as provide it a momentary reprieve from the funk of the sea. And while bigger restaurants — Toro and The Pool — would go on to serve uni sandwiches on toast with mustard, none have the approachable, iconic calling-card status that Raij’s does. ',\n",
       "  'The serving vessel was, and still is, wax paper. This is not uni as a luxury item, which it often is. This is uni as a sandwich, meant to be consumed while standing up, on the go. It is one of New York’s great dishes. ',\n",

       "  'El Quinto Pino and sister spot Txikito around the block remain two of the most compelling expressions of Iberian fare in New York. The former has few equals in the sphere of tapas, while the latter might just be the city’s top Basque spot.

Neither El Quinto nor Txikito, by contrast, generate much of a queue for walk-ins. In fact both are so close to each other and the food comes out so expeditiously that one could literally hop between the two.',\n",

The floral heat gently burns, until a mash of sweet peas, sitting below each croquette, cools the palate.

       "  'And while El Quinto Pino is not a Basque restaurant — more about Txikito in a bit — her statement rings true. Or put differently: at El Quinto Pino, Raij and Montero use supporting flavors to deify a lead protein or vegetable. Their cooking evokes a superb three- or four-ingredient cocktail. Waiters don’t spend an hour describing the food upon presentation, because a spice or seasoning listed on the menu is apparent to the diner immediately upon consumption, without explanation or elaboration.

They riff on txangurro, the traditional stuffed crab, by slicking the shellfish with cream cheese, warming it under the broiler, and lighting it ablaze with the very non-Basque sriracha; it packs as much crustacean flavor as a good crabcake yet it costs just $8.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen shreds skate wing with parsley coulis, fried garlic, dill, and cilantro, treating fish as if it is a salad ingredient meant to be tossed in a verdant and fragrant salad of herbs. It’s the type of dish one might expect at the two-Michelin-starred Aska.',\n",

Txikito substitutes brisket and stuffs it into green peppers, balancing the meatiness of the protein against the vegetal tang of the capsicum.

For vegetarians, chilly paneer and chilly mushroom — using a common Indian spelling of “chili” — are good choices. A particularly filling starter is keema naan, a naan stuffed with ground meat that comes with a bucket of mild gravy.',\n",
       "  'But let’s cut to the chase, entrée-wise. One of the best features of the restaurant is the use of cream rather than milk in its recipes. Cream chicken ($8.99) is the menu’s flagship: boneless bird in a buff-colored sauce lacking the expected masalas. It tastes herbal and almost French. One of the herbs is certainly fenugreek, and the recipe, formulated by the chain’s founder, is further enriched with crushed cashews.',\n",
       "  'This dish seems like a challenge to the more commonly seen butter chicken, a Punjabi crowd pleaser featuring poultry pieces in a pink tomato sauce. Some fellow diners and I decided to compare cream chicken to butter chicken one evening, and I was the only one who preferred the cream chicken. “The butter chicken is a little bit sweeter and more richly flavored,” one friend observed. I recommend trying them both side by side, and rendering your own opinion, since they’re two of the most delectable things on the menu.',\n",
       "  'The northern vegetarian Indian standards are all available in above average renditions, including malai kofta (vegetarian “meatballs” in a thick sauce), palak paneer (spinach with fresh cheese cubes), and mushroom tikka.

Jumbled with raw yellow and red bell peppers and purple onions, the dish is an explosion of colors and textures. And for those who detest the usual sliminess of okra — this method of cooking banishes it.',\n",
       "  'In line with the fresh and natural aesthetic of the restaurant, the tandoori chicken is not colored red with artificial dyes. Instead, it is coated with a beige spice paste before roasting in the oven. While wholesome tasting, it doesn’t pack the smoky wham of the usual recipe, so skip it. One dish I found particularly interesting was something I’d never encountered before: rara mutton. Pieces of tender lamb swim in a sauce laced with lots of ground chicken. Ground chicken? Well, for folks who always order the meat lover’s pie in a pizzeria, consider this a great choice.',\n",

The restaurant itself is distinguished by its exposed red brick, ornamental carpets, stunning tiles the color of Uzbekistan’s sky-blue minarets, a mural depicting the historic madrasas of Samarkand, and a bar television that shows the ballgame. The bar is often empty. ',\n",
       "  'The real draw of Nargis, of course, is the breathtaking melting-pot cuisine of Uzbekistan, meaty and muttony traditions that balance Turkic, Asian, Persian, and Slavic influences. Cabbage kimchi — Stalin deported thousands of Koreans to Uzbekistan during the Second World War — sparkles with stinging heat and high-voltage acidity. Lagman, the classic Uighur dish, is everything it should be: a crimson lamb soup laced with mild chiles, green beans, peppers, and toothsome hand-pulled noodles.

Rego Park and Forest Hills in Queens are home to Cheburechnaya and scores of other great kosher Central Asian spots — frequented by the Bukharan Jews who fled as the Soviet Union collapsed. Uzbekistan’s Muslims, by contrast, have largely settled in Sheepshead Bay, Kensington, and elsewhere in Brooklyn, thousands of them having availed themselves of the diversity visa program to flee economic hardship at home. Their presence in King’s County paves the way to success for excellent and occasionally halal spots like Tandir Bakery, Emir Palace, and Cafe Kashkar.',\n",

As the chef himself puts it, “People would say, ‘What the hell is Uzbek food?’” But over the years, that sentiment changed and his clientele diversified. “That gave me the strength to say, ‘Other people besides our own love my food,’ and that’s when I said it’s time to give Park Slope a shot, which I considered the big leagues.”',\n",
       "  'Still, Bangiyev is likely aware that the former Soviet Union’s diverse foodways — or geography — don’t quite carry the same currency among the so-called food elite as regional Mexican or Thai fare.

The heat transforms chicken hearts into springy, snappy saltiness, with little sinew or offally tang.

But what if the best way to mimic the taste of this classic luxury is to do away with death altogether? ',\n",
       "  'During a recent meal at Otway, an envelope pusher of a restaurant in Clinton Hill, a server ferried over a dessert plate of yeast semifreddo, a healthy-sounding combination that recalled bean burgers or kale smoothies.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen makes an ice cream base out of cream and butter, blends in fresh yeast and dark, malty Vegemite, freezes the mixture in a disc-shaped mold, lets it partially thaw during dinner service, and tops it off with huckleberry puree and a rye cookie. The color is tan. The texture is denser than gelato. And the flavor is a dead ringer for foie gras. I asked the waiter whether there’s liver in the dessert. She shook her head. I continued eating, slowly, and then furiously.',\n",
       "  'The duo of yeasts imparts the product with a subtle minerality. And the huckleberry, laced with a whisper of verjus, kicks in the requisite sugars and acidity to keep everything balanced. The recipe is simple, almost mundane, but the alchemy that occurs somewhere in between emulsification and defrosting results in a transformation one might more closely associate with a Hogwarts spell than an act of normal gastronomy.

       "  'The yeast semifreddo, like so much else at Otway, is not the product of a Silicon Valley fake-meat startup. It is not the combined effort of a culinary team with a deep background in avant-garde flavor combinations. The dish is a simple act of experimentation. Claire Welle, who creates the pastries, says she chose yeast as a flavoring agent because she wanted to “explore ingredients used for function and see if they could operate as flavor.”',\n",

They also promote, by virtue of their crowds, the notion that residential areas are teeming with diners who crave culinary creativity.',\n",

It is an improvement on 99 percent of the lobster rolls hawked in this town, and it costs just $13. ',\n",

First, they identify the product as “Joël Robuchon’s” potatoes, in case anyone suspects that the “chef of the century” outsourced the recipe for a mere side dish. Second, they claim that the potatoes themselves are “famous.” This is true. In 1980s Paris, the indulgent spuds helped Robuchon make a name for himself at his now-closed Jamin. The impossible ratio of butter to fingerlings, as well the fact that Robuchon was serving such a humble dish at an ambitious venue, epitomized the chef’s efforts to counter France’s lighter, brighter, yet somewhat affected nouvelle cuisine.

Vigorous whisking imparts the potatoes with the texture of silk, but the dairy fats, which cool quickly, stiffen up to the density of a leaden paste.

More recently, a branch daringly opened on St. Marks in the East Village. It grabbed the second-floor space formerly occupied by Grand Sichuan, itself an early advocate of the Sichuan peppercorns that have become ubiquitous in the neighborhood.',\n",
       "  'A stone-clad koi pond and burbling waterfall confronts you upon entering the space. Enclosed bamboo booths trail off into an interior decorated with pottery and other elements, intended to evoke the eponymous mountain retreat. But far from mounting a menu obsessed with the rural or even the urban food of Sichuan, the bill of fare is an eclectic document. In addition to Sichuan standards and Sichuan-themed inventions, it borrows dishes from other regions, leaping from Hunan to Dongbei to Beijing to Hong Kong.',\n",
       "  'Part of the appeal of both Mountain Houses is dramatic platings. Take the first item on a menu: sliced pork belly with chile garlic sauce ($10.95). Looking like thin slices of pale bacon, poached pork belly hangs over a dowel like laundry on a line, interspersed with slices of shaved cucumber. Underneath, a receptacle of chile oil with a wad of mashed garlic is destined for dipping. The contrast of the raw garlic’s pungency and the pork belly’s blandness proves unforgettable, and there’s no better dish for audience participation in town.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes this awesome creativity runs off the rails, though. Less successful is “grilled beef ribs with steamed bun” ($21.95). In actuality, the ribs should be singular and the bun plural, since the dish consists of a single humongous beef rib, somewhat resembling the sort found at the city’s Texas barbecues. Alongside are the kind of folded, steamed bao you now see in nearly every Asian fast food spot. The meat has been cut from the bone, and it’s tough and gristly from being roasted too fast and too hot, which is why the same rib is cooked “low and slow” in barbecues.',\n",
       "  'Also on the novel side are round shrimp fritters sided with sliced spuds, like pink ping pong balls with paddles; and planks of mung bean starch in chile oil and Sichuan peppercorns that wiggle and wobble in a glistening array. There are Sichuan standards, too, including twice-cooked pork, kung pao shrimp, and a ma po tofu ($10.95) that manages to taste better than any other with its silky tofu, earthy fermented bean paste, and daring oiliness. When it wants to, Mountain Szechuan can serve straight-up Sichuan, and it doesn’t stint on the peppercorns.',\n",
       "  'Some Sichuan dishes are charmingly amplified. Peanuts are introduced to the usual ox tongue and tripe in chile oil, adding crunch to the slipperiness. And the full complement of organs and other varieties meats is in full force. Indeed, Szechuan Mountain House should receive plaudits for offering pig intestines and kidneys, fish maws, curdled blood, and the notably-named “strapping cattle throat” ($10.95) — rubbery white strips of integument that’s popular in Chongqing, a major municipality in southwest China. ',\n",
       "  'Perhaps in adherence to the current proclivity for eating lots of vegetables, Szechuan Mountain House has some of the most interesting vegetarian dishes in the city, scattered throughout the menu and not just in the section called “Vegetable.” A brilliant bowl of yellow corn kernels come individually coated with duck egg yolk, giving them a unique texture and making them taste cornier than buttery theater popcorn. The signature fried rice is ramified with mustard greens, while a dish of fried lotus roots and celery provides a spectacular snap that you can hear as diners around the table attack it, with a subtle flavor that you’ll dream of that evening.',\n",
       "  'But the most exciting aspect of Szechuan Mountain House lies in the fact that the daring menu hasn’t been made blander for a perceived East Village audience, mirroring the sorts of experimentation and quest for novelty seen heretofore mainly in the new Sichuan restaurants in Flushing — and presumably, in China itself.',\n",

       "  'It’s a shame, but not a surprise, that braised onion pasta has never achieved avocado toast-like fame. Slow cooked onions are a study in slouchiness, an ode to the texture of mush. Yes, two of the most prominent and indulgent riffs come from two of the world’s late, great food writers — Marcella Hazan, who recommends cooking the onions in lard, and James Beard, whose butter-laden recipe Food52 considers the “highest form of caramelized onions known to man.” And yet the dish is almost entirely absent New York’s Italian restaurants — almost.',\n",
       "  'I Sodi, a decade-old Tuscan restaurant in the West Village, corrects this allium oversight with a bit of elegant austerity.',\n",
       "  'The kitchen uses just three ingredients: red onions, salt, and a little bit of olive oil, cooking them down and tossing the sauce with house-made tagliatelle and parmesan. Anyone who finds the flavor of slow cooked onions to be a sugar substitute, take note: There is no lusciousness in I Sodi’s version, no taste of fat. Like a dry Amontillado sherry, the caramel color belies a lean, sharp flavor. The little gobs exude an earthiness so profound they recall the meatiness of a vegetarian chili. ',\n",
       "  'Braised onions might not be the central reason this tiny spot commands a two hour wait on Fridays. But their grandeur certainly suggest what chef Rita Sodi can do with very little.',\n",
       "  'Sodi, a fashion industry vet who was raised on a farm north of Florence, opened her namesake restaurant in 2008. She had no formal training as a chef. I thought her best dish, in the earliest days, was the negroni.',\n",
       "  'The venue quickly cultivated a loyal neighborhood following, and I heard the food improved over the years, though Sodi didn’t receive a serious level of critical attention until 2014, when she opened the excellent Via Carota nearby, a larger, more boisterous, pan-regional, Italian spot with chef Jody Williams.',\n",
       "  'The two chefs have morphed into bona fide (but small time) empire builders; they’ll soon open Pisellino, a small cafe that will sell cute little tramezzini. But before the media coverage over that spot starts to build, it’s worth throwing the following into the mix: I Sodi, quieter and more compact than Via Carota, has transformed itself into one of the city’s finest Italian spots, a love letter to Tuscany whose pure product obsessions can make it feel as focused as some of the wildly expensive sushi spots popping up around town. ',\n",
       "  'The room, in January, smells heavily of the black truffles that are native to Sodi’s homeland. She lets them rain over pappardelle for $39 (compared with $65 at Babbo). And she shaves them over grilled sourdough slicked with honey and draped in lard, the sweet fat just warm enough to release the mossy overtones of the fungi. A cynic would dismiss this as found food, as an easily assembled luxury; I’d respectfully counter that Sodi’s brilliance is taking this trinity of powerful Tuscan flavors — charcuterie, bread, and truffles — and forging a precarious balance among them through the primitive power of fire.',\n",
       "  'Sodi, who’s sometimes overly humble about the power of her own cooking, would likely scoff at that description. “It’s just food. It’s just enjoyable food,” she told The New York Times in 2014. “That’s it. You put it on the table, you talk and you eat.” ',\n",
       "  'There is, at first glance, a certain incongruity about the cooking of Tuscany, an expression of bountiful produce and game meats. There’s something paradoxical about how the birthplace of the Italian Renaissance, how the home of poets like Dante and polymaths like Da Vinci, how the land of the breathtakingly complex Brunello di Montalcino, a wine that can age for half a century or more, is also where the cooking somewhat fastidiously leans toward the simple and straightforward. But it doesn’t take long to realize that the cooking is far from simplistic. ',\n",
       "  '“Tuscan food tastes like itself,” writes the famed memoirist Frances Mayes. “Ingredients are left to shine, not combined with a list as long as your arm or tortured into odd combinations.”',\n",
       "  'I mention this because in an era when phrases like “rustic” and “comfort” in New York restaurants can feel like a code for safe and boring, and in an era where Italian fare of any variety can feel more like a “sure thing” business decision than a culinary one, it would be easy to look at I Sodi’s menu and write it off as plain or pandering. Look, another appetizer of grilled vegetables. ',\n",
       "  'Well, try those vegetables, especially if they’re porcinis. Sodi gently burnishes the fungi, leaving the caps soft and squishy, while the stalks remain firmer. Some bites burst with a straightforward nuttiness. Others begin a touch watery, then echo faintly of wood and pine. I thought about these complexities over I Sodi’s giant plate of porcini, for which I paid $23. And then I thought about a one-note version I sampled at a Japanese spot where dinner ran $500 for two. ',\n",
       "  'Sodi fries her artichoke hearts without batter; she serves them with neither aioli for dipping nor lemon for squeezing. A waiter simply places a white bowl of salted hearts on the bartop, and you eat them as if they were unevenly cut potato chips, crispy and copper-colored at the edges, plump and soft near the fatter side.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant’s recipe for steak tartare doesn’t contain cheddar or sunchokes like the more experimental versions at Wildair or Estela. And yet the flavor is as revelatory as any of its modern analogues; the cool meat, hand chopped just larger than risotto grains, shimmers in its dressing of anchovy oil. Raw onions lend a whisper of sweetness at first, and then a delicate irony funk lingers — until a forkful of arugula washes the palate clean. If there’s a better traditional tartare in the city, I don’t know of it.',\n",
       "  'I Sodi is small. It’s a single room of a restaurant, accessible just behind a barn house-style sliding wood door; the only thing that doesn’t feel genuinely Italian is a Dyson space heater in the foyer. There are three tables up front, five along the wall, a sixteen seat marble bar opposite them, and and airplane-style aisle in between; a beverage cart passing through would surely elicit bumps and bruises. And yet somehow the entire space has always felt comfortable. Perhaps it’s the leather-softened bar stools. Perhaps it’s the sound-absorbing tablecloths. Perhaps it’s even that sliding doors, which is so silent that new patrons don’t seem to physically enter as conjure themselves.',\n",
       "  'The closest thing to an art installation is the rack of amari and digestivi that stretches half the length of the bar. You might need one or two during the meal — a shot of rose-scented Montenegro, a dose of rhubarb-laced Sibona — as pastas are portioned like mains while the actual mains can easily feed two. That’s not a bad deal considering that virtually every pasta, save truffles or the lasagna, tops out at $21. ',\n",
       "  'That caramelized onion masterpiece is the right move for a shared mid-course. So is cacio e pepe, a preparation whose ubiquity seems to be approaching hamburger levels in pasta-focused restaurants. I Sodi’s stands out from the crowd by using a snappy dried spaghetti over the softer tonnarelli used elsewhere — and by using a strong dose of pepper, letting the sting of the capscium act as a proper counterweight to the rich pecorino.

A better call is the giant, obscenely juicy cornish hen roast under a brick, or the slowly-braised wagyu brisket, a soft mound of concentrated beefiness over a smear of buckwheat polenta. Sodi cooks the grains in nothing but water — there’s no butter or cream — ensuring that the starch, normally a digestive evening ender, acts a light and nimble foil to the beef.',\n",
       "  'Whatever fat the polenta and caramelized onions lack, the desserts make up for, from the fior di latte gelato drenched in walnut liqueur (a kind of boozy affogato), to the graham cracker-studded chocolate ganache “salami” (imagine a more elegant cookie dough), to the tiramisu so dense with mascarpone it could qualify as a cheese course for two. All the more reason for another shot of Montenegro. Or Ramazzotti. Or Branca Menta.

       "  'Located at the corner of Calyer and Franklin near the East River’s Bushwick Inlet, the immediate neighborhood remains tree-shaded and slow moving. Houses with small gardens in front line the streets in neat rows. Pale flagstones cover the façade, while a sidewalk café with red umbrellas extends along the north side of the building.',\n",
       "  'Inside, the tables are small and matched, wooden and well-spaced. A bar provides padded stools; plain white globes hanging from the ceiling furnish illumination. In all its plainness, is this yet another French-Canadian bistro of the type we saw at M. Wells and Fedora a few years ago? Well, partly, and the first time I sat down in August, when the place was already four months old, flagons of maple syrup lined the kitchen. Indeed, Chez Ma Tante is named after a Montreal french fry and hot dog stand. But in other ways, the restaurant is very much a unique place.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant is the work of two Cafe Altro Paradiso alums, Aidan O’Neal and Jake Leiber, and the menu reflects some of the old Estela zaniness. In its emphasis on organ meat pates and terrines, it’s also reminiscent of Montreal’s Au Pied de Cochon. O’Neal once toiled at M. Wells Dinette in P.S. One, and that experience undoubtedly provided further inspiration. The chicken liver pate ($9) might be at home on any bistro menu in town, artfully smeared across the plate and accompanied by grilled toasts and pickled chiles.',\n",
       "  'Other dishes are on another level, offal-wise, particularly with the pig head terrine. This patchwork comes in helter skelter slices, composed of ragged chunks of sinew, fat, and deeply red swatches of meat. It’s about the richest thing you’ve ever tasted and might remind you of the work of U.K. chef Fergus Henderson. I loved it, even though it came with the same toasts and chiles as the chicken liver pate. (The head cheese is currently off the menu, but the waitress assured me it would return: “The chef just didn’t have access to a pig head this week,” she confided.) ',\n",
       "  'Apps from both the snacks and starters sections of the menu are more prosaic, but each offers its own playful twists on familiar recipes. Bright red with radicchio, Caesar salad ($13) comes in lemon dressing so light that it might have been painted on with a brush. Delicate potato chips surmount steak tartare — useless for scooping, but useful for crunch. But it’s the few drops of fish sauce that make this tartare memorable. ',\n",
       "  'The best appetizer, next to the head cheese, is stracciatella ($15), a molten dairy product in the burrata family that comes sluiced with chile oil, wadded with wilted greens, and further kicked in the pants with anchovies. This spectacular bread dip — intensely creamy and briny — could be your entire meal. While there’s no poutine on the menu, the city’s best steak fries are found here, a sublime shade of sun-kissed brown and served with aioli, very much in the Montreal mode. Less Canadian is an oyster service, each $3 bivalve littered with parsley and accentuated with a splash of sauvignon blanc. Think of it as a small collection of raw-oyster salads.',\n",

In fact, it might be “the most difficult recipe here,” the authors wrote, “because there are so many small choices that make a big impact.”',\n",
       "  'It’s a lesson worth recalling at Reynard in Williamsburg’s Wythe Hotel, in case anyone’s inclined to dismiss the pumpkin puree — humble mashed squash — as yet another plate of marked-up Thanksgiving nostalgia. ',\n",
       "  'Christina Lecki, who joined as head chef this summer after leading April Bloomfield’s Michelin-starred kitchen at The Breslin for years, makes a bevy of infinitely small choices that add up to big flavor. This is true of all her fire-kissed American cuisine, the product of a wood-burning hearth in the kitchen, but it is especially true of her shockingly complex pumpkin.',\n",
       "  'Lecki uses the dying embers at the end of service to slowly roast her pumpkins overnight. The next day, she purees the collapsed gourds; cooks them down with chicken stock and onions; fortifies them with buttermilk; laces them with chile, cinnamon, and nutmeg; passes them through a chinois for silkiness; ladles them into a small brown wooden bowl; and finishes them with a pat of kefir butter.',\n",
       "  'The pumpkin accompanies a half chicken that’s been smoked and roasted, which is great in its own right, but believe me when I say that bird is just a supporting player. The puree takes on the color of rust and sports the texture of ice cream. The flavors range from vegetal to sweet to gently tangy (from the kefir), with lingering notes of Christmas spices. And unlike a fancy French pommes puree, or an overindulgent polenta, the butter here is used with restraint; it never detracts from the essence of the pumpkin. ',\n",
       "  'It is best consumed on a cold day, watching the neon of Wythe Avenue light up the falling snow. Add a touch of the chicken’s vinegar- and offal-laced gravy for extra oomph, and take pleasure in consuming one of New York’s next great dishes. ',\n",
       "  'Since it opened nearly six years ago, Reynard’s identity hasn’t so much centered around the food or the chef as it has around the urban ethos of its operator, Andrew Tarlow. The hospitality guru rose to fame at his restaurants Diner and Marlow & Sons, where menus scrawled on receipt tape, carpentry contracted from local artisans, and meats sourced from local farms helped shape the Kings County restaurant identity and solidify a global image of #Brooklyn as an exportable brand of crafty hipness.

       "  'Reynard is a touch spiffier than Tarlow’s other venues. It felt, in the early days, like a gently commercialized hagiography of Williamsburg’s industrial past, a clean-cut blend of reclaimed wood ceilings, scratched mirrors, patterned tile floors, and distressed brick walls, all in a reasonably priced hotel that boasted killer views of Manhattan. The natural wine list was awesome, the natural light was killer for photo-friendly brunches, and the straightforward American fare was, well, straightforward. But it never wowed.',\n",

Lecki’s all-day American fare makes hearth cooking feel like the primal — yet studied — act of deliciousness it should be, rather than the performative and pedestrian act it’s become in too many restaurants installing Cadillac grills. Her creations, more gutsy than gut-busting, are lighter and brighter than much of what she put out at The Breslin, with no fatty steaks for two, with acid used strategically, and with the flavor of fire feeling more like a subtle background note than an overwhelming act of quasi-barbecue.',\n",
       "  'Consider the pig’s face — a bit of an acquired taste. Lecki makes it user-friendly by heating it up on the griddle, rendering all the gelatinous bits soft, and bringing out the dish’s porcine perfume. She lays a small pile of lettuce on the side for wrapping, along with a little bit of pickled jalapenos to cut through the fats with spice and zing. There’s your Italian-American bo ssam right there.

       "  'Lecki gets more aggressive with the fire in her urchin course. She torches pita over the wood coals, dusts it with a speckle of house-made togarashi, and pairs the piping-hot flatbread with cold Massachusetts uni on the half shell. This bread and butter course — with its palate shocking chaud-froid — brilliantly uses the heat of the chile and the smoke of the grill to tame the squishy funk of the sea.',\n",
       "  'To achieve this level of precision, Lecki had Tarlow and a local steelworker remove the kitchen’s old Argentinian grill, whose raw-wood style of cooking could overpower ingredients with acridity, she tells me. In its place, Tarlow installed a plancha and hanging racks, allowing for more controlled cooking. ',\n",

Consider two dishes: A mash of minted sweet peas arrive on torpedo-shaped masa cakes — making the tlacoyos a stunning visual impersonation of avocado toast — while the actual avocado toast sports such an impossibly polychromatic array of tomatoes you’d swear the kitchen took its inspiration from a bag of Skittles. ',\n",

A gentleman in a gray overcoat with a leather weekend bag zooms northward on a hoverboard. A woman hurries down the sidewalk in an oversized sports jacket, a loosened neck tie, and, wait for it, sweatpants. ',\n",

Atla soaks it overnight, pours it into a shallow brown bowl, then tosses chia with flax seeds, pumpkin seeds, candied ginger, and cashews. Oatmeal, traditionally, is a nourishing, rib-sticking dish.

The raw cubes of beef round out an ode to chile peppers. Chicken caldo, in turn, serves as a delivery mechanism for a salad’s worth of basil, oregano, and cilantro. And the largest quantity of pork on the menu comes in the humble chicharon guisado, soft blankets of pig skin that serves as sponges for the hot crock of salsa verde they’re stewed in, a dish that was maybe a bit too steamy for a recent 90 degree day.',\n",

Soto-Innes turns a thick slice of ciabatta into a veritable vegetarian buffet, smearing it with goat cheese, guacamole, onions, and tomatoes ranging in color from red to green to purple to yellow.

Another thing: The Kaluga caviar lacks the intense richness and lingering finish of superior Osetra, or Baeeri varieties. Now is it still an insanely delicious dish? Of course it is.

We savored pungent pecorino and rustic salami as a first course, just-made pastas lightly sauced as a second, and third courses of meat, fish, or fowl unencumbered by sides or starches. And the cuisine’s emphasis on fresh and locally sourced ingredients was to profoundly influence New York dining in the decades that followed.',\n",

The flesh is as soft as a ripe avocado, but the flavor is closer to key lime pie. The salt turns out to be a tart, citrus-y ice, and beneath it all is a smear of eucalyptus yogurt, a refreshing middle finger to the spa food this all mimics.',\n",

A classic example is WD~50’s old sunny side-up egg, in which the yolk was carrot juice and the white was firmed-up coconut. This whimsical ethos, combined with the chef’s limitless imagination, is part of what makes Empellon feel so vital. Stupak is pursuing a grown-up’s version of that childhood wonderment: He’s making diners experience something new and surprising all over again.',\n",

The ice cream boasts the faintly sour taste of a barely underripe fruit. Your fork then slices into the faux-rock –– really an ash-dusted cajeta —that yields a richer, more complex banana flavor. This is impressive because the sweetened goat's milk, alas, contains no banana: It’s infused with jasmine oil, a volatile perfume that mimics the flavor of the fruit.

       "  'Broadway from 100th to 116th Streets in Upper Manhattan may be poised to become a hotbed of northern Chinese and Korean eats. It started with a series of carts parked by the Columbia University entrance gates, vending spicy noodles, pork-filled dumplings, bao sandwiches, and kimchee-laden stews to students and faculty who demanded modern East Asian fare, but couldn’t find it elsewhere in the area. Gradually, brick-and-mortar establishments have appeared in the blocks south of the campus, in a neighborhood sandwiched between the Upper West Side and Morningside Heights.',\n",
       "  'One example was Lava Kitchen at 101st and Broadway, a brightly lit spot specializing in dumplings, bing, garlicky vegetable appetizers, and noodle bowls with a range of hotness — and, believe me, the hottest was really, really hot. The latest newcomer is 108 Food Dried Hot Pot, a boxy corner storefront at 108th Street that had been an Irish bar. It offers the city’s latest Chinese food fad: the dry hot pot, a craze renowned for its spiciness that began in Beijing and first appeared here in Flushing food courts.',\n",
       "  'Dry hot pot is different than regular hot pot in that a standard hot pot involves cooking at the table by swishing morsels of food in a bubbling broth. Dry hot pot uses many of the same raw materials, but they’re cooked in the kitchen as opposed to at the table. This hot pot is not a soup but a stir-fry and the finished product glistens with oil, not “dry” in the least. The communal enjoyment on the part of the diners and a similar roster of ingredients is what unites the two types of hot pot. ',\n",
       "  'Here’s how it works at 108: You step up to a lavish display of raw ingredients deposited in metal tubs at the rear of the restaurant. An attendant with a sense of humor, her baseball cap turned askew, will assemble the ingredients you point to, putting the meat, poultry, and fish in one metal bowl ($10.99 per pound), and the vegetable matter in another ($9.99 per pound).',\n",
       "  'She brings these to a weigh station by the register and you are then asked to specify a level of hotness: non-spicy, spicy, medium spicy, or very spicy. (The heat comes from a combo of chili oil, dried chiles, and Sichuan peppercorns.) The ingredients are whisked away, stir-fried with scallions and ginger, only to reappear cooked, at which point your number is called, and you pick up the order. Hopefully, you will find a table in the interim if you didn’t snag one already, and your friends will be sitting there, chopsticks at the ready.',\n",
       "  'Picking ingredients from the 48 tubs is somewhat bewildering: Will you try pig ear, fish balls, gluten, seaweed knots, or chicken gizzards? Certainly, napa cabbage, squid, rice cake, bok choy, and shrimp are go-tos for some. I’d avoid the thin-shaved beef, which looks good raw but completely falls apart when cooked. A pink and salty Spam-like ham was a surprise favorite and so were the baby sausages. Fish proves superb and enoki mushrooms get too soggy, while the wadded tofu skin retains its texture. Ultimately, pick what looks good: three or four ingredients for each person sharing the hot pot.',\n",
       "  'One rice bowl is furnished for each diner. If you can keep your hot pot ordering on the meager side, there’s a whole other menu available that’s printed on paper, not posted, and lists mainly Sichuan and Cantonese fare, as if 108 Food were secretly a neighborhood Chinese carryout. If the apps seems more expensive than you might expect, know that the servings are humongous. The northern Chinese standard of cracked cucumbers ($9.95) with garlic sauce is improved with peanuts and cilantro and is like a species of heroin.',\n",
       "  'Ox intestine and sliced beef ($12.95) and spicy beef tendon — the connective tissue in the cow’s ankle — arrive in razor-thin slices for easy mastication and both dishes slide down the throat on a wave of chile oil. There are also plenty of large-format entrées in a Sichuan/Northern Chinese vein. Though hot and spicy shrimp ($18.99) is the most expensive item on the paper menu, it’s well worth the cost. Enjoy old-fashioned Cantonese? Pork and egg chow mein provides a heap of well-slicked, flavorsome noodles with a fried egg on top.',\n",
       "  'In fact, I’d put the food quality at 108 Food up against that of any Chinese restaurant in town at a similar price. And its location is a boon, because not only is it more convenient than Flushing for Columbia students and professors, but for many others as well.',\n",

This is starting to change as more Taiwanese restaurants open in Flushing, Elmhurst and Sunset Park, with dishes that display regional flavors from Shanghai, Sichuan,Guangdong, and Beijing. These influences reflect Taiwan's history, reaching back to the Chinese Revolution — when it was flooded with refugees — and earlier. The island's culinary mix has also included Japanese, European, and American influences: a reminder of its occupation during the last World War and its location as a maritime crossroads. \",\n",
       "  \"Witness Taiwan's mouthwatering menu at Happy Stony Noodle in Elmhurst. The location is a block up Broadway from Taiwan Gourmet, an old-guard place that treats the historic bill of fare more ponderously, tendering whole fish, stir fries, and tempura, a Japanese import. By contrast, Happy Stony is a rollicking and lighthearted noodle shop offering contemporary fare like popcorn chicken and sweet-potato French fries, as well as noodles in soups and stir fries.\",\n",
       "  'Whether the cryptic English name and slack-jawed happy face logo refer to cannabis or not, the Chinese name translates to Happy Beef Noodle, a place that caters to college students eager for a taste of home, extended families, and kids who dash in after school for a quick bite. The room is big and boxy and painted buff, with black-and-white photos of agrarian scenes that might make you think Taiwan is filled with farms, like some oceangoing Iowa.',\n",
       "  'Taiwan has its own dim sum tradition distinct from Cantonese dishes, which includes dishes like the wonderful oyster pancake ($7.95). Inside a flattened egg flapjack flecked with scallions lurk a plethora of freshly shucked oysters. This omelet may have inspired one of the first Chinese-American dishes created during the California Gold Rush and called Hangtown fry. But the contemporary Taiwanese rendition has globs of translucent sweet-potato starch, which play tag with the bivalves, creating a confusion as to what kind of goo you’re eating at the moment.',\n",
       "  \"Among dim sum you'll also find tempura-style chicken cutlets, fluffy buns drizzled with sweetened condensed milk, fried squid balls (which the menu lists as calamari), and, tastiest of all, something called pork roll ($6.95). Tender pieces of pork are cradled inside a tube of fried tofu skin, making a crunchy and mellow snack that can be shared by several diners as an appetizer.\",\n",
       "  \"The central menu panel features full-meal soups, offering a choice of four kinds of noodles: wheat spaghetti, mung-bean vermicelli, and flat or round rice noodles. Of the many bowls I tried, my favorite, number 52, was beef stew and tendon with flat rice noodles ($7.50). In it, magnificent wobbly chunks of tendon vie with richly textured stew beef for the attention of your chopsticks. The broth is red and slightly spicy. Go for the pig feet if you'd like gluier noodles and head for the beef and hot pepper noodles ($8.50) for spicy noodles.\",\n",
       "  'Holy basil makes an appearance in some dishes, such as the national dish of Taiwan, popularly known as \"three cup chicken,\" which the menu lists as chicken with ginger and basil ($11.95), though it includes sesame oil, rice wine, and soy sauce that\\'s cooked down to a sweet, basil-scented sludge here. A vegetarian version using eggplant is also quite agreeable.',\n",
       "  'The menu showcases organ meats like pig bowel, pig’s ears, and pork and beef stomachs, along with other surprising ingredients like pickled mustard greens paired with oblong rice cakes. Many dishes have playful names, often not listed on the English menu. One is fly heads ($11.95), listed in English as as minced pork with black beans. \"Aw shucks,\" you may say, \"no real fly heads?\" Well, no, but the taste of ground pork, fermented black beans, and bales of garlic chives is awfully good, insects or not.',\n",

       "  'I don’t typically say much about a waiter’s introductory menu speech, a tired formality for which there are no James Beard Awards, but in the case of The Pool, which follows The Grill in the reboot of the historic Four Seasons space, the service staff’s preprandial remarks can point to the extent to which you’ll be financially hammered. This is a restaurant, after all, where there’s just one wine list for the table, but where every single diner is presented with a card listing sixty different Chateau D’Yquem selections priced from $90 to $19,000.',\n",
       "  'On one fine evening, a server in a custom Tom Ford suit — inspired by the one Daniel Craig wore as James Bond, an owner tells me — was reciting the specials, including one of king crab dressed in coconut milk, noting that the crustacean is being offered at market price, which is as logical as announcing that the day’s special soup is soup du jour.  ',\n",
       "  'When pressed, the waiter revealed that the single-serving appetizer — four ounces of meat — runs $95, to which I deadpanned, “that sounds reasonable.” ',\n",
       "  'And the waiter walked away.',\n",
       "  '“There has never been a restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan than The Four Seasons,” New York Times critic Craig Claiborne wrote in 1959 —  a line that couldn’t have been more prescient for The Grill in 2017: a raucous four-star chophouse where tuxedoed waiters transport diners back to a mid-century dinner party so wonderfully staged you wonder when the JFK impersonator is going to show up and pose for selfies. ',\n",
       "  'You walk through The Grill to arrive at The Pool: chef Rich Torrisi’s pricier and more sedate maritime spot that occupies the second half of this landmark restaurant complex. It lacks the tongue-in-cheek humor of The Grill. Or the creativity. Or the energy. ',\n",
       "  'The room evokes the sea through a constant sense of motion: the bubbling, marble-clad pool, the slowly spinning Calder mobile that hangs above it, the shimmering curtains. Floating planters accent the walls with notes of green and orange, while cocktails serve as ad hoc decorations, sporting giant slices of watermelon and banana on the rims. Paired with a soundtrack that includes light reggae beats, the ambience evokes a refined Manhattan riff on a nautical dive somewhere in the Caribbean –– though there’s something slightly off about listening to Harry Belafonte croon about Jamaican dock workers while a well-heeled clientele nibbles on Carolina Gold rice for $36. ',\n",
       "  'It’s good rice, infused with the sweetness of Dungeness crab and the heat of jalapeno. But it’s a heck of a price for what’s essentially a side dish. And it’s a heck of a lot better than the $28 venison tartare with oyster sauce, a preparation with a uniform blandness that would make it perfect as a starter in any business-class airline cabin.',\n",
       "  'The Pool’s shortcomings include the food, which is why a more skeptical line from Claiborne’s 1957 review resonates here. The Four Seasons’ approach to American cuisine, he wrote, was “not exquisite, in the sense that la grande cuisine francaise at its superlative best is exquisite.”',\n",
       "  'Perhaps that statement seems silly. Diners don’t visit a Mexican spot and muse upon how it pales in comparison to a thousand dollar French or kaiseki meal. Outstanding New York gastronomy isn’t a comparison of one cuisine over another. It’s a manifestation of great food anywhere anyone can find it.',\n",
       "  'Then you dine at The Pool, with its soft blue carpeting, Zalto wine stems, and polychromatic tomato-strawberry salad, which is gorgeous, but gosh, that salad is like $23 and it doesn’t deliver the same electric perfume as it does at Le Coucou. You sample the striped bass with mole spices, which turns out to be a bland square of fish with zero mole flavor, and you wonder whether you should’ve dined at Le Bernardin.',\n",
       "  'That’s when the Claiborne voice in your head whispers: This isn’t as good as some of the city’s best French or Japanese seafood spots. That voice is right. If the mid-aughts in New York were a watershed moment for luxurious American venues ready to take on the Le’s and La’s of the city, ambitious seafood spots never forged as rabid a following (or as many Michelin stars) as their Continental or Asian-leaning counterparts.',\n",
       "  'The Pool has the star power to change that reality: With its sashimi, carpaccio, harissa, Latin peppers, tropical drinks, lobster, aged steaks, aged duck, underpriced caviar (like a discount on a Hamptons mansion) and overpriced everything else, it comes closer than most in channeling diverse ingredients into an American melting-pot celebration of the world’s oceans. If only Torrisi were doing his best work here.',\n",
       "  'Bread service, uni toast, Alaskan king crab, Dover sole',\n",
       "  'Take toast, a genre Torrisi mastered at ZZ’s Clam Bar in the Village, where he tops pretzel buns with urchin and mustard oil for an haute riff of ballgame fare. He anoints white bread with trout roe and honey, adding a breathtaking sweetness to counter the salty fish eggs.',\n",
       "  'And yet at The Pool his toasts are about what you’d expect at a chic charity benefit. Uni toast is nothing more than a few dollops of good urchin with apple; two tiny slivers for $23. Tuna toast with harissa, which has the potential to balance silky maritime fats against the heat of chile paste, tastes more like a spoonful of fish slicked with good olive oil.',\n",
       "  'In another dish, Torrisi freezes foie gras terrines and shaves them into the shape of  tulips ($32). The petals, served with fragrant slices of dehydrated orange chips, melt on the tongue like cotton candy before yielding to a citrus crunch — a touch of cognitive dissonance for one of the world’s richest foods. We paired it with a $60 sashimi plate of fresh mackerel, two grades of fatty tuna that dissolved like tissue paper, and raw scallop dressed in maitake oil, a sweet, slippery mollusk with the perfume of a Russian forest. That’s four minute’s worth of amuses right there for $92. ',\n",
       "  'Lobster tail ($29), grilled to a silky medium rare and plated in the shape of vertebrae, simultaneously delivers a delicate smokiness from the binchotan charcoal and a restrained pucker of yuzu. Just as compelling is the entree portion, exuding a more concentrated tang of the sea, perfumed with a hint of coconut and orange. It’s hard to think of a more compelling octopus preparation than Torrisi’s, where the pulpo provides char, gelatin, and firmness, while a sauce of aji dulce sparkles with the fruitiness of an habanero –– yet a tenth of the heat, and far more acidic. These are nuanced, precise preparations. ',\n",
       "  'Then a waiter brings over a whole grilled madai snapper ($88). It is neither nuanced nor precise, but rather two fillets on a plate, burnished skin over white flesh, an explosive study in smoke and mildly overcooked fish. Match that with a nutty, heady strip steak that’s better than the same cut at all but a few of the city’s steakhouses, and you have yourself a stellar $140 surf-and-turf. ',\n",
       "  'But still, few of the dishes here excite the way that Torrisi did in the late aughts when he elevated the humble Manhattan chowder to fine-dining status — and charged just $50 for the tasting.  ',\n",
       "  'One of the drawbacks about The Pool not being prix-fixe is that some might miss out on Stephanie Prida’s outstanding desserts: a Manresa alum who provides the only reliably four-star experience.',\n",
       "  'She layers coconut cream with grapefruit mousse into little aromatic bricks. She fills the narrow end of a ceramic bowl with chocolate custard that shows off the cacao’s mind-bending fruitiness. She turns tangy frozen yogurt into visual art, placing the curvilinear quenelles on a pedestal and stacking them vertically as if to mimic the futurism of a Zaha Hadid’s High Line apartment complex.',\n",
       "  'If The Grill gets around the yet-another-chophouse quandary through mining the past for historical food, The Pool needs to perform with greater fish fluency to keep pace with its French and Japanese competition. ',\n",

       "  'Philip Johnson’s bead curtains sparkled in the sunlight. Rudy Giuliani — who had not yet transformed into a spitfire caricature of himself on cable news shows — was quietly holding court just a few tables away. Niccolini noticed that my companion and I were sharing one bowl of asparagus soup. He offered to split it, removed it from our table, then returned in no time with two bowls of asparagus soup. How kind. A few weeks later I looked at my receipt, and saw that I had been charged for three bowls of asparagus soup. ',\n",

       "  '“There has never been a restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan than the Four Seasons,” New York Times critic Craig Claiborne wrote of the newly opened venue in 1959. The Grill Room, together with the adjoining Pool Room, was the crown jewel in the empire of the legendary Joe Baum, a trendsetting restaurateur who, here in the Seagram building, would seek to convince stateside gastronomes that seasonal American cuisine, buffeted by tableside, a la minute preparations, could command as much respect as fancy French fare.  ',\n",
       "  'By the time I made a series of three visits in 2008, Claiborne’s statement only held true in the sense that there were few other establishments better geared toward shaking down diners in a way that evoked the excess of a capitalist system that was on the verge of its biggest crash since the Great Depression. Niccolini and Alex Von Bidder lost their lease in 2016, the same year the former plead guilty to misdemeanor assault stemming from charges of sexual abuse. That July, The Four Seasons took its final bow. ',\n",
       "  'Nearly a year and $30 million worth of renovations later, The Grill Room has transformed into an energetic and exhilarating chophouse, The Grill, while the adjoining Pool Room, a sedate seafood spot that I’ll review this fall, has become The Pool. Fans of aristocratic continuity take solace: You will still spend a ton of money here. But now, you will eat well.',\n",
       "  'The new operators are Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone — two chefs with a reputation for charging a lot in their immersive, theatrical restaurants — and business partner Jeff Zalaznick, scion of a powerful finance family. The late Baum, one of the original gangstas of dinner-as-show, couldn’t have picked a better trio himself. ',\n",
       "  'If the Grill, in 2008, was a lunchroom for the rich, it has become, in 2017, a four-star a la carte throwback. It shows off a style of meaty midcentury indulgences and warm, avuncular, let me-tell-you-another-story-about-JFK hospitality that, given the means, I’d partake of twice a week or more. A theme restaurant for the wealthy, but one that puts everyone under a spell that they belong here, on this stage, where it’s always 1950s Manhattan, rain or shine.',\n",
       "  'Buffet chefs donning ten-gallon toques arrange chilled crawfish platters made with housemade Old Bay — a sweeter, more New Orleans analogue to shrimp cocktail. In a vast kitchen, cooks braise endives with black truffles while in the dining room, waiters in Tom Ford tuxedos use a $10,000 tableside torture device to crush poultry parts into the base of a sauce whose notes of blood, salt, and cherrywood recalls the juices that collect at the bottom of a cutting board after a good night of hunting. This is ladled over a tangle of yellow egg noodles in a gold rimmed bowl. It is pure luxury. ',\n",
       "  \"Despite all the renovations, the space — mahogany panels, curtains that undulate like a perpetual motion machine, and Richard Lippold's bronze rods, hanging above the bar in way that evokes the old Manhattan skyline — looks pretty much the same. It takes cash to stay gorgeous over the decades.\",\n",
       "  'Making food that actually tastes good takes even more cash. Earlier in July I dropped by The Grill and ordered a vichyssoise heavily fortified with caviar ($98) and mock turtle soup forged from tripe and chiles ($19)',\n",
       "  'So nearly ten years after I accidentally spent too much on a single soup at The Grill, I ended up spending about $150 after tax and tip on two bowls of soup.',\n",
       "  'Raise a glass to Claiborne; there’s no restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan right now than The Grill. It is a self-referential institution that is almost too perfect for a city perennially obsessed with itself, and perhaps newly obsessed with the past, a city whose choice of red meat is increasingly prime rib, a city whose gastronomes sometimes prefer a $100 a la carte carte dish to an $100 prix-fixe, a city where plush dining rooms are coming back after a decade of stripped-down gastronomy, a city where the locus of dinner-as-theater is moving away from open kitchens and back to the dining room, where, in the case of The Grill, an open flame nearly singes your eyebrows in a tableside display for cherries flambee.',\n",
       "  'The Grill is gastro escapism in these Trumpian times, a restaurant that whisks you back to when JFK was president, to a time when the United States, not Germany or France, was the leader of the free world, to a time when people didn’t really wonder whether California does the best avo toast. Here, vegetables and grains come with butter, cream, and crab. Asparagus, the so-called king of vegetables, isn’t cold-pressed or served raw, but creamed into a soup and served underneath a pastry dome. This gently bitter, gently sweet indulgence is known as Jack’s pie and is named after a certain U.S. president who might’ve sampled it here during a birthday celebration. ',\n",
       "  'The genius of Carbone and Torrisi is that they’re not elevating or refining the overpriced, underwhelming Four Seasons that members of the Momofuku generation largely ignored. They’re reimagining an era of restaurants that came and went before many of us were born, an era many of us associate with fictional, hard-drinking advertising executives, an era when well-heeled patrons, during the apogee of what Henry Luce deemed The American Century, traveled to The Four Seasons to experience a uniquely stateside style of fine dining, one whose internationalist tendencies were more of a hat tip than a kowtow to European traditions.',\n",
       "  'Those patrons, old menus show, would come to sample black cherry soup, calf brains en brioche, ham mousse stuffed into a whole peach, and perhaps most famously, wild mushrooms, which contemporary waiters, in their obligatory tableside speeches, remind you were not in great supply until the Four Seasons debuted. If that sounds like an overly staged setup for the the mushroom omelet, consider the following: The egg isn’t so much the main event as it is a loose binder for a pack of earthy maitakes, spongy morels, nutty chanterelles, as well as a few slivers of that preserved black truffle. I sampled this dish twice and both times it was like trying wild mushrooms again for the first time. It is spectacular. ',\n",
       "  'Equally spectacular is the caviar vichyssoise. I don’t typically recommend fish roe at restaurants because it’s a pure product play: Chefs open a can of roe and mark it up. At The Grill, a waiter is quick to tell me the Latin name of the roe (baerri). Like any good baerri, it rolls around the palate like a marble until a flick of the tongue crushes it into an intense and lingering maritime oil. It is the flavor of Osetra times ten, until a clean shot of potato and leek soup cleanses the palate for more. ',\n",
       "  'That’s $100 soup I’d splurge for again. ',\n",
       "  'If caviar that costs as much as a one-way Acela ticket still seems a bit too, well, European, I can recommend with no less fervor the Amish hamsteak, a supermarket staple of my youth that generally constituted an iridescent slice of precooked pork slathered in maple syrup. It was awesome. The Grill’s version is more awesome. ',\n",
       "  'The kitchen takes a fat slice of heritage pork, injects it with ham brine, cooks it, smokes it, slathers it in pineapple glaze, caramelizes it in the hearth, and fans out the slices on a gold-rimmed plate with slices of pickled pineapple. At one level, the dish is magical because of its elevation of an old suburban supper. But even if you’ve never tried hamsteak, a dish found on about zero New York restaurant menus, it still works because of the execution; the silky fattiness, gentle smoke, distinct sweetness, and electric acidity simultaneously qualifies it as the city’s best pork chop and a remarkable act of Mid-Atlantic cooking translated into haute barbecue by way of an extraordinarily fancy restaurant in New York. ',\n",
       "  'That hamsteak, as it turns out, is from an old Four Seasons menu, one from 1964 that I came across online. There’s something energizing in knowing that a preparation, or at least a version on it, is what somebody’s wealthy grandparents might’ve sampled, once upon a time.',\n",
       "  'The same perhaps could be said about a few other items from that old menu, available now: Like cherrystones in pepper vinaigrette served as lightly poached littlenecks in housemade tabasco. Or lamb steak in “susu curry,” reborn as three chops doused in a light turmeric-cumin curry and a dense mint jelly.',\n",
       "  'And the “heart of the prime rib,” from those Lyndon Johnson days, is a wet-aged juicy cut, minus the prized deckle. That’s a disappointment at first, until the kitchen brings a deviled bone, a thin layer of soft, intensely beefy flesh rolled in Montreal-style seasoning that you pick up and eat: No more disappointment.',\n",
       "  'It would be easy to dismiss all this as plagiarism of the past, but I like to think of it as akin to the work of Quentin Tarantino, who takes a collective mass of cinematic pulp — from World War II spy flicks to Westerns — lifts the material from its source, and transforms it, sometimes quite minimally, into visual poetry like Inglorious Basterds and Kill Bill II. It is the culinary equivalent of found food, and quite frankly it’s probably twice as delicious if you don’t get bogged down by the references and just eat. ',\n",
       "  'Critics, myself included, almost exclusively award four stars to tasting-menu restaurants for a simple, and quite frankly logical reason: The lack of choice means fewer misses and longer menus allow for the occasional failures inherent in ambitious cooking.

       "  'Brooklyn’s most meteoric restaurant success in the last decade was Roberta’s. Starting out as a modest pizzeria with a wood-burning oven in an obscure corner of Bushwick, it swelled into an empire. Who can fault other rustic Naples-style pizzerias for trying to duplicate that success? Since Roberta’s founding in 2008, copycats have appeared in gentrifying Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods: Saraghina in Bed-Stuy (2009), Barboncino in Crown Heights (2011), Houdini Kitchen Laboratory in Ridgewood (2013), and Union Pizza Works in Bushwick (2014). Now a new one has sprung up, spinning tasty wood-fired pies.',\n",
       "  'Santa Panza materialized at the end of 2016 on a remote stretch of Broadway on the Bushwick/Bed-Stuy border, where subway tracks clatter noisily overhead, blotting out the sky. Not long ago the neighborhood mainly hosted 99 cent stores and second-hand appliance refurbishers, trailing ranges and refrigerators along the sidewalk. Now there’s a new hotel across the street, hipster bars in the immediate vicinity, and a fast-casual café nearby specializing in bao sandwiches. The three owners — Pietro Hebel, Giovanni Gelfini, and Clement Chabernaud — cut their eyeteeth at Saraghina and Union Pizza Works.',\n",
       "  'In fact, the interior of Santa Panza (\"holy belly\") will remind you of Saraghina: A serpentine layout with improvised furniture and whitewashed wall twists and turns through a barroom, open kitchen, blackened oven defended by a wall of huge tomato cans, and back dining room, culminating in a backyard seating area. The rear dining room proves the most comfortable, pin-drop quiet and decorated with topographic maps of obscure places like Port Taranaki, New Zealand. If you are geographically challenged about your exact location in Bushwick, the maps will confuse you further.',\n",
       "  'The core menu is unambitious, suggesting that maybe Santa Panza is happy to be and remain a pizzeria. Eight pies are available in two sizes: six inches ($7 to $9) and 12 inches ($12 to $16). A little quick math will tell you that the smaller pies cost about 18 cents per square inch, with the bigger ones around 9 cents. Yes, the big pies are twice as good a deal. However, the small pies allow you to try more of them. They also provide a larger proportion of the smoky crust that is the real payoff of these pizzas, which provide a meager quantity of toppings. That’s the aesthetic and it certainly improves profitability.',\n",
       "  'Stippled with char, those crusts are superb, with an ethereal lightness and no yeasty aftertaste. The ones I liked best were the Napoli, pungent with Kalamata olives and anchovies, reminding us how Neapolitans love sharp flavors; and the self-named Santa Panza, which features pungent scamorza cheese in addition to the creamy and mellow buffalo mozzarella that stealthily appears on most pies unannounced on the menu.

What cut of the cow does the meat on the pinchos come from? \"It depends,\" says a manager. \"It\\'s mixed.\"',\n",

Pickles cleanse the palate, but then again, so does the mojito.\",\n",

But I can tell you about Juan de la Cruz, a man who\\'s prominently featured on Guantanamera\\'s website, and who\\'s the first person you\\'ll see in the restaurant on a Friday or Saturday. He\\'s not the host. He\\'s not the bartender. He is, by his own description, a \"professional Cuban cigar expert,\" and he sits by the window and uses what he assures his customers is Dominican tobacco to roll what the restaurant describes as \"complimentary baby fat stogies for customers who want to savor a sidewalk smoke reminiscent of the days of the Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta of 1950s Havana.\"',\n",
       "  'De la Cruz, bald and lean, is a man of precision. He wears a crisply laundered button-down and rimmed glasses. His hands move across his workspace without ambivalence; watching him manipulate tobacco is no less mesmerizing than watching a master sushi chef mold nigiri. He eyeballs the binder leaf and shapes it down to size with a circular caveta knife. He adds filler leaves, rolls them up, snips off the wayward end with a table cutter, and places the aromatic cylinders in a wooden press for shaping. The finished products sit by the anteroom window like a pile of aromatically incendiary Lincoln Logs.

Guantanamera is a place to hang out without the constant pressure to order another $15 cocktail, though you'll certainly want to. It is a social club without the membership or the mafia.

It is a frugal dish, often made with potatoes or cold polenta, built for surviving winter in the Alps. In the Detroit region of North America, frico refers to the messy, miraculous effect of putting so much mozzarella on deep dish pizza that it spills over the side of the pie and crisps up on the edge of the pan. It is a technique of excess in the land of plenty. And it's exactly what makes the square pies at Emmy Squared in Williamsburg so gosh darn amazing.Motor City pizza has arrived in New York. This is the monster truck of the ambitious pizza world — a weighty pizza for two. On the surface, the style seems familiar: Sicilian-American focaccia-like crust, cut into squares.

The thick crust is softer at the top, but requires a bit more chew on the pan side thanks to the golden \"underskirt,\" the term that true pizza nerds use for the bottom of the pie. The pie cools further as you bring it home – which you inevitably will because this is the mammoth steak for two of the pizza world. In the box, the oils start to firm up, fully developing a satisfying heft overnight in the refrigerator.

This is Williamsburg, so there’s the requisite raw kale option for those who like salads as chewy as leather.

After the dough rises, he adds the cheese, sauce, and toppings, and bakes the pizza in a gas-fired convection oven (which allows for more stable temperatures than wood) for about 10 minutes. A Neapolitan pie, by contrast, takes about 60 to 90 seconds. While the pizza bakes, all the oil at the bottom of the pan fries the dough – apologies, underskirt – imparting the pie with that golden crust. All this density and crispness is what lets the pie live a second life during takeout and delivery, rather than getting soggy, like a traditional Neapolitan pizza.',\n",

If you’re a ranch person (a Midwestern thing), you’ll order The Emmy, topped with a homemade version of the dressing, vivid with green tarragon. I’m tempted to say don’t be that person, but I’d probably be chased out of town if I did.

More subversive types like Roberta’s forged a more New York-influenced version of the Neapolitan pie, stiffening up the crusts, and throwing on anything and everything, from pastrami to blue cheese to honey to pickle juice. Cracker-like Roman pizzas popped up at Danny Meyer’s Marta, while Sullivan Street Bakery took a different approach to Rome, serving al taglio-style room temperature flatbreads with crimson tomatoes and mandoline-shaved zucchini slices.',\n",

If a classic Neapolitan pie is more like a filet mignon in its chew, Emily’s version is closer to a skirt steak: It tires the jaw just a hint more, but the payoff is more flavor in the crust, with just enough carbonized char to impart roundness and smokiness rather than bitterness.',\n",

Not only does its structure provides a more affordable way for restaurants to test out their ideas than does a brick-and-mortar location, but it also allows open-palated gastronomes to construct an eclectic meal by traversing only the length of a small shopping mall, instead of a large swath of the city, roaming from poke spot to toast joint without fear of death by vehicular traffic.\",\n",

I’ll be disappointed the next time I cut into a humble cabbage leaf and find that it’s not stuffed with jiggly foie gras and heady black truffles, like it is at Augustine.

And yet, I kind of see his point. With all the well dressed people behaving better than they would at Tao, though in a more raucous fashion than they would at Le Bernardin, it’s easy to see how hanging out at Augustine can promote a sense of benign promiscuity among a certain crowd.

Two women try to charm a Parisian bartender by tackling the dizzying linguistic acrobatics involved in ordering a Grey Goose & soda in French.

And this year McNally thought it was a good idea to publish this: \"It’s difficult not to be anything but fully supportive of a system that protects employees from harassment. But, remembering what it was like to be in my 20s, I believe it’s also important not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.\"',\n",

Trying to distinguish among, Pastis (RIP), Balthazar, Cherche, and Augustine is like differentiating the various entrants in the Fast & Furious franchise.

The Stilton-esque odor of the dry-aged beef is clean and clear on the plate, but as you chew, the blue cheese notes form a quieter background note to the pyrotechnic spices, a vibrating bassline for an electric guitar.

I bring this up because during my visits to the rose- and saffron-scented Indian Accent in Midtown, waiters would often regale me with sometimes overly obvious preprandial pedantries before I was allowed to eat. Here’s what I was told: That New Delhi is the capital of India (thank you). That kofta is also known as a meatball (really).

And there’s something particularly pleasant about sitting inside the famed manure shed at Blue Hill at Stone Barns while the wait captain literally points out how the latent heat of compost is sous-viding your next course, because the visual imagery is right there, and because poop usually merits an explanation when it’s involved in a $1,000 meal.',\n",

Almost every steak here is a study in the same degree of blandness. The steaks lack aromas of beefiness as much as they lack stronger overtones of stilton or offal. They are the bovine equivalents of chicken breast. The only noticeable difference between a dry-aged strip and a wet-aged ribeye is the price tag, and that the latter has more moisture. Only the grass-fed filet justifies its $50 price; the meat packs a gentle, natural acidity that tingles like a good Riesling.',\n",

That one exception, incidentally, is a two-ounce steak that comes as part of a $125 tasting of New York sirloin. It was, and I mean this as someone who loves Japanese Wagyu, objectively terrible.

Located at 23 Chatham Square, Szechuan Taste — the name reflected the old-fashioned transliteration of \"Sichuan\"— served a sophisticated take on a cuisine that had recently caused a sensation in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. Clifford mentions that the chef had worked in Taipei for famed landscape painter Chang Ta-chien (who inspired his own Sichuan dish), and the chef’s repertoire in Chinatown included tea-smoked duck flavored with camphor, hot braised live carp, and sliced pork sautéed with fish flavor.',\n",
       "  'During the ensuing decade more Sichuan restaurants popped up in Chinatown, but less predictably, the Upper West Side became a hotbed of the fiery cuisine at places like Szechuan and Szechuan Royal — with the hotness toned down and an emphasis on such tamer recipes as noodles with sesame sauce and baby shrimp, Szechuan-style. It was this blander version of the cuisine, and one lacking Sichuan peppercorns, which were then technically illegal in the US, that eventually worked its way onto the menus of nearly every neighborhood Chinese restaurant in the city.',\n",

Rochesterians will want to investigate this further, but the rest of us can be very content with an order of chicken wings and a chocolate milkshake.',\n",

The type of restaurant called a \"meat and three\" has long been a fixture of small towns from Georgia to Arkansas, a sort of Dixie diner dispensing fried chicken, meatloaf, and sweet-glazed pork ribs at prices everyone could afford. These entirely predictable mains shared the plate with three generous sides, hence the name. The side-dish choices ran to mac & cheese, collard greens, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes swimming in gravy, with a bonus piece of cornbread. I wondered at what wallet-busting prices this institution might be recreated for us Yankee city folks at Harold’s.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant’s namesake is Harold Moore, whose most recent stint at Commerce in the West Village ended not long ago. The chef’s current project is situated in the Arlo Hotel (named after Arlo Guthrie?), just north of Canal Street in a wind-whipped non-neighborhood near the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. The space is luxuriously large, with a main dining room ending in a kitchen where logs flame up merrily in an open hearth. Overhead, industrial fixtures shine down on a floor that might have been designed by M.C. Escher, the tiles matrixed in dizzying fashion.',\n",
       "  'A parallel dining room contains a liquor bar, a salad bar, and picture windows overlooking an outdoor terrace, which will be a fine place to dine in summer — assuming the restaurant survives. I believe it will. The menu offers a series of starters, including deviled eggs topped with bacon, steak tartare, pimento cheese spread, and visits to that salad bar, which, aside from a few luxury items, is nothing special. Anyway, you should skip the appetizers or \"you’ll ruin your dinner,\" as my mother might say. True to the promise of a real meat and three, a main course with three sides at Harold’s is plenty of food. (Especially since a free biscuit often precedes your meal and a tiny soft-serve cone follows it.)',\n",

       "  'Priced from $18 to $42 (the former for a veggie burger, the latter for prime rib), 18 main courses are presented, along with 24 sides. The prime rib is a delight, carved tableside as it oozes juices, and so’s the hanger steak. It comes napped with an agreeable wine sauce, listed on the menu — which is not above spouting French — as \"marchand du vin.\" Other notable choices include roast chicken, beer-can style; a thick pork chop; seared sea scallops; and veal meatballs. In the first weeks those meatballs came in gravy, later in tomato sauce. Indeed, the chef is always diddling with the menu, making every visit an adventure.',\n",
       "  'One day, I arrived to discover the pork chop, once plainly grilled, was now being offered Sichuan-style. It came in an \"au jus\" that was only slightly spicy, while a coating of Sichuan peppercorns on the surface of the meat furnished a substantial tingle. Score one surreal taste sensation for the chef. Less successfully, an entree of tripe bathed in New Mexican green chiles was a failure one evening, with too many white beans and too little offal. But the price was right ($19), and Moore must be praised for trying something new.',\n",

Avocado fixes everything, right? Less appealing sides included a roasted artichoke heart so small it almost disappeared, as well as a broccoli-and-rice casserole that had too little of the treelike veggie in it, with what there was minced overly fine.',\n",
       "  'One of the great things about Harold’s Meat + Three is that it can function as a real meat and three if you choose the right things. Thus, you can get fried chicken ($24) with sides of grits, creamy coleslaw, and mac & cheese, just like you might find in, say, Beaufort, South Carolina, or Fort Deposit, Alabama. The chicken is really a half Cornish game hen, lightly battered and delicately fried, and it comes with a pair of sauces: pepper-dotted gravy and aromatic honey. I advise you to pour the gravy over your grits and enjoy the crusty bird one nibble at a time with no sauce. Skip the honey.',\n",

       "  'Mexican food enthusiasts generally agree that the country’s most exciting eats are found in Oaxaca. In this rugged land of scenic beauty in southernmost Mexico, indigenous Native American tribes like the Zapotecs and Mixtecs still make up a large part of the population. The cooking is exceedingly time-consuming, using ingredients like nuts, herbs, fruits, chocolate, and dried chiles to make complex sauces in earthen hues called moles, which often date to pre-Columbian times. The corn-based antojitos are different, too, including garnachas, tlayudas, tetelas, and tamales that come wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks. One taste of real Oaxacan fare and you’re hooked.',\n",
       "  'Unfortunately, New York City generally ignores the cuisine. While Los Angeles hosts such amazing Oaxacan restaurants as the traditional Guelaguetza, and the more innovative Mole De Los Dioses, plus over a dozen others, we have only La Morada in the Bronx, where the menu merely dabbles in Oaxacan food. Stray dishes are to be found at restaurants like Rosa Mexicano and Hecho en Dumbo, but even the taco chain that calls itself Oaxaca, without a trace of embarrassment, offers little authentic Oaxacan fare. Heck, even New Brunswick, NJ, boasts at least four Oaxacan restaurants.',\n",
       "  'Thus it was exciting to learn that a new Oaxacan spot had opened in January on Church Avenue in Kensington. Once a pizzeria, La Loba Cantina boasts two high-ceilinged rooms outfitted with small pedestal cerveza tables; tiled flooring in random patterns; a shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe; paintings of blushing, bare-shouldered señioritas; a Spanish guitar begging to be strummed; with cacti and other xerophytic foliage in profusion. In short, the place really feels like a dusty cantina in southern Mexico. The bare-bones second room is devoted to an open kitchen, while a rear courtyard catapults you back into the world of Brooklyn tenements.',\n",
       "  'The dining room at La Loba Cantina',\n",
       "  'But one glance at the menu lets you know the place is more about mezcal — a smoky spirit associated with Oaxaca — than about food. This is not necessarily a bad thing. There are 50 varieties available in small and large shots, ranging in price from $6 to $30. Many come in picturesque pours, featuring gourds, crockery, citrus wedges, and spice-dusted wooden platforms. Really, if you escape the cantina without becoming tipsy from a couple of shots, you’re missing the point of La Loba (\"The She-Wolf\"). The drinks list also includes themed cocktails, beers, and a roster of tequilas, but more interesting are several obscure spirits, including herby sotol, fruity raicilla, and bacanora — a liquor smelling like pears that was bootlegged before 1992 legalization, as the menu tells us.',\n",
       "  'Inevitably, this alcoholic onslaught overshadows the food, much of which is nevertheless quite good. Foremost on the evening menu is the tlayuda, often referred to as a Mexican pizza. A large round of hand-patted masa is rubbed with refried black beans, then heaped with spring onions, avocado, cilantro, stringy white cheese, radishes, and tomatoes. The dish is exceedingly pretty, though La Loba’s rendition is too bland and greaseless. By contrast, the tlayudas in Oaxaca often come layered with gobs of raw lard and the funky jerky called tasajo. Of the four variations at La Loba, pick the house-made chorizo ($13), rather than the plain, chicken, or cactus.',\n",
       "  'Faring better are the Oaxacan tetelas (two for $7), folded masa triangles stuffed with beans and cheese, delicious when dipped in the accompanying brick-red salsa. Quesadillas ($9 to $11) are huge flops of folded-over masa dough, rather than the stateside bar snack of parallel flour tortillas glued together with cheese. In this case they’re stuffed with mushrooms, squash, chicken, or just cheese. One thing to skip is the ceviche, which features fish, pineapple, and jicama mounted on two small tostadas. The problem with the restaurant’s version is too little fish. Panuchos, featuring a blue fried-tortilla base, are topped with cochinita pibil, the pork stew that constitutes Yucatan’s gift to world cuisine. Here it lacks the perfume of bitter oranges and mouth-thrashing habanero chiles.',\n",

On it is a green pozole from the state of Guerrero — a wondrous swamp of verdant flavor floating pungent fresh herbs, scimitars of green avocado, and glistening coins of radish. This is the very spirit of southern Mexico expressed in a soup. Almost as good is the luncheon repast of tired tortillas called chilaquiles (which you should ask to be customized with a pair of fried eggs), and memelitas — miniature ridged masa vessels filled with refried beans and cheese. La Loba could become your favorite brunch spot in Kensington.',\n",

Six outdoor benches are arranged in a large U shape around the perimeter, the type of seating plan that tasting menu spots construct around an open kitchen.

Patrons sit on fabric cushions, sipping orange wine and noshing on fried pickled fiddlehead ferns or puffy crawfish chips, watching fireflies glow a bioluminescent yellow. At Olmsted, the garden is theater. The raised beds around the benches are covered with a carpet of greenery so thick and soft it\\'s a wonder folks don\\'t try to slip the staff a $50, take off their shoes, and lie down amid the vegetation, a pastoral analogue to tipsilly wading through pool at The Four Seasons.',\n",

A server ferries over a small ceramic bowl filled with white fluff adorned with flowers. Half of each spoonful is delicate, ethereal, honeyed, aromatized with lavender. This is whipped cream. The other half is cold, dense, and sour. This is frozen yogurt. The dish, as well-balanced as any of the more savory starters, is a monochromatic study in temperature and texture: It's nearly impossible to tell which of the two ingredients you're eating until it's actually in your mouth. It recalls Heston Blumenthal's iconic Hot Tea Cold Tea, a preparation where the two distinct beverage sit in a single glass with no barrier. Rarely in cuisine have cognitive dissonance and color been used in concert to such brilliant effect.\",\n",

And yet at Olmsted, a modest storefront restaurant in Brooklyn's well-heeled Prospect Heights, most dishes are under $20. Credit due to Greg Baxtrom, a chef who's spent time working at venues where $800 meals for two are not uncommon — Stone Barns, Atera, Alinea, Per Se — for giving New York one of its most paradoxically ambitious yet most approachable restaurants. After just three months in business, Olmsted easily joins the ranks of Estela and Wildair as one of the city's best and most creative small-plates places.\",\n",

Baxtrom takes thin slices of Long Island fluke and paper-thin rounds of confit lemon, wraps both around pinky-sized sticks of the crimson melon, and finishes it all with fleur de sel. The sugars from the fruit, when mixed with the tart citrus and the high-end salt, electrify in the mouth; it's like a high end Sour Patch Kid.\",\n",

Ian Rothman, Baxtrom\\'s partner in the 50-seat endeavor, oversees the backyard farm, and if the food here wasn\\'t so good you\\'d roll your eyes at his bio. Rothman was the horticulturist at Atera, where (as Olmsted\\'s website explains), he \"oversaw the restaurant\\'s subterranean garden and living wall.\" All those who reckoned that a more pared-down spot like Olmsted might be deprived of its own living wall (let\\'s stop using that phrase): Fret not. Rothman has constructed a mosaic of green stuff that spans the length of the interior portion of the restaurant.',\n",

Now take a bite: Summer truffles impart a whisper of woodsy funk, the garlic shocks the tongue with bitterness, and the soft, savory custard resets your palate with just a touch of sweetness.

Your typical neighborhood spot doesn\\'t command two hour waits on a Friday. The more accurate way to consider Olmsted might be as a destination local restaurant. It\\'s a venue that fills a need in the immediate community — Prospect Heights has plenty of casual weeknight spots, but no real history of haute cuisine — and yet it also ends up attracting a city-wide crowd — likely to be national, once word gets out.',\n",
       "  'A destination local restaurant presents a dilemma, as adulation and accolades (not to mention suddenly impossible-to-get-tables) tend to change a place. A prime example was the December 2007 issue of Bon Appetit: the powers that were decided to give the cover to the meatball sliders served at the Little Owl, an affordable West Village haunt that was already pretty packed every night. It was a seminal moment for small restaurants, many of whom had been living in the shadow of the Buddakan-style big box behemoths that arose in the late aughts, and a presager of the post-recession return to more intimate dining.',\n",

But not all restaurants weather the attention so unchanged. When another destination neighborhood spot, NoLiTa's walk-in only Torrisi Italian Specialities, started to attract fans thanks to its affordable set menu, it slowly raised its price from $45 to $100, and then beyond. What began as a welcome antidote to fine dining became yet another expensive — albeit excellent — practitioner of the art.\",\n",
       "  \"None of this is to deny a good restaurant the chance to capitalize on its fame and evolve over the course of its lifespan. But in an era with so many operators pushing the tasting menu hard, it's heartwarming to see Olmsted take a more populist approach to ambitious gastronomy (Baxtrom tells me he has no plans to ever go prix-fixe only). It's also exciting to have another outer-borough pole holding up the city's high-end dining scene, which has spent the last decade spreading slowly (arguably too slowly) outward from Manhattan.\",\n",
       "  \"To put Olmsted's prices in perspective: A bottle of well-balanced orange wine runs $30 (a Manhattan venue could easily charge twice that). And the steak entree is $23 — a dollar more than a pizza at Franny's a few blocks away. That steak, by the way, is flawless: It's a grass-fed bavette that's silky as Japanese Wagyu; it delivers not a dry-age funk but an obscene beefiness. Baxtrom changes up the accompaniments depending on the season; when I dined there, he amped up the bovine factor with a tiny squash filled with a ratatouille that was a bit muskier than usual, thanks to a layer of beef short rib.\",\n",
       "  \"Fans of the atavistic appetizer-entree-dessert format might argue that Olmsted's servings are a touch small even by small plate standards. I'll counter that I've never tried anything here that isn't large enough to share. For a proper meal for two, you'll want to order about seven dishes — six shared savory plates, one dessert — plus a bottle of wine.\",\n",

Then you rip through this decorative facade with your fork. Beneath lie soft little neck clams (or sometimes surf clams) and a rich yellow carrot jus infused with the flavor of the sea. Your palate is overwhelmed with butter and brine. Baxtrom has reimagined linguine with clams through the lens of a root vegetable, a French crepe, and the colors of a sunflower. It's stunning.\",\n",
       "  \"But as cutting edge as Olmsted is, it wouldn't be a proper 2016 restaurant if it didn't offer an agrodolce cauliflower, the current reigning version of which is gobi manchurian, a sino-subcontinental snack that involves turning the plant into a vegan riff on General Tso's chicken. Baxtrom goes more refined with an analogue called gobi pakoda; the fried romesco choufleur isn't drenched in neon goo, but rather sits adjacent a curried gastrique that's nearly as dark as a demi-glace. A candy-like sweetness hits you first, then a tamarind tang, then a wallop of heat from jalapeño.\",\n",
       "  'Scallops, the throwaway entree of the past 15 years (\"Maybe we should sear them?\") find a new relevance by being threaded on skewers and grilled over charcoal, with a wicked coating of deeply flavored pasilla chiles. Some of the mollusks are firm and cooked through, others are charred on the outside and enjoyably jiggly within; just when things threaten to get too salty, a mess of creamed corn, cooked in the style of risotto, resets the palate, its sweetness an early foreshadowing of dessert.',\n",
       "  \"Follow those up with the sublime steak or a roulade of guinea hen, at $24 the most expensive large plate, though good enough that I'd happily pay double that. The bird's gamy white meat is rolled around ramp mousse and roasted, sometimes creating the visual effect of a yin and yang when sliced. The sweeter, funkier thigh meat is doused under a swathe of foamy ramp hollandaise; searching for the morsels with a fork evokes a Michelin-starred riff on bobbing for apples. (Baxtrom says all the manipulation allows him to squeak out three instead out two portions out of each hen, helping him keep the price low.) Finish it up, then give up your table (if you like; there's no pressure from the elegant service team) to walk back outside for dessert. The meal ends where it begins, in near perfect bliss.\",\n",

On the other end of the cost spectrum, but also located on Fifth Avenue, Sushi Ginza Onodera opened its doors in May, slinging high-end, omakase-only meals.

Most expensive is an omakase, coming in at $55 for 11 pieces of nigiri sushi and half a maki roll. In one instance that roll featured otoro (fatty tuna, the fanciest type), and the nigiri highlights included a plump scallop lightly seared and surmounted by a face of crunchy lotus root with two preserved-plum eyes; a slice of fatty fluke with a tiny dab of dilled mayo; and a piece of nicely cooked salt water eel.',\n",

Other menu items include tofu made with milk instead of soybean curd, and a broiled tuna collar ($19.99) so massive the restaurant asks it be shared among three or four diners.

When it was his turn to tend the gates one evening, the inebriated prince passed out at low tide leaving them open, and the ocean soon came rushing in, permanently drowning the land.

In another entrée, a cliff of bone-white hake ($18) rises out of a sea of chunky tomato sauce flavored with butter and seaweed, giving the fish more flavor than it rightfully possesses.

       "  \"Quenelles de brochet are not uncommon in Lyon. But in Manhattan they're a dish of longing, of memory. They evoke a pre-tweezer past when Midtown was the hip part of town and adding cream made something fancy instead of fattening. The quenelle de brochet is endangered not because gilded-age institutions spin them out of rare fish but because the dish has slipped into stateside obscurity — along with the chefs who championed them in a pre-social media age.The quenelle is what makes restaurateur Stephen Starr's Le Coucou, in the 11 Howard Hotel in Soho, an unmistakable outlier. It is the rare restaurant less than forty years old to offer this laborious dish.\",\n",
       "  \"The kitchen extricates infinite pin bones from the pike, purees the fish with cream and eggs, forms the mixture into oblong quenelles, simmers them in salt water (where they expand), drenches them in sauce Americaine (essentially lobster bisque), and bronzes them under the broiler. Cooks place a single fist-sized quenelle in a gold-rimmed bowl and ladle it with more of the frothy, concentrated shellfish sauce. The quenelle, at Le Coucou, is a maritime marshmallow in a crustacean latte. It's a throwback dish that's somehow as avant garde as an edible green taffy helium balloon; Le Coucou, after all, has transformed a firm-fleshed fish into an edible cloud, a dish so light it's as if you're eating something that isn't there. You simply look at it, Instagram it, and minutes later, it's just a daydream.\",\n",

       "  \"Le Coucou, set in a room that smells sweet of slow-cooked carrots and heady organ meats, is not Spring, nor is it Rose's more bistro-esque La Bourse et la Vie, also in Paris. It takes a few more cues from a heady continental past than it does from a pared-down stateside present. There is no veal candy, only veal tongue. There are no ultra dry-aged ribeyes, only bone marrow-sauced filet mignon with pommes boulangere.\",\n",

       "  \"One minute Rose goes all 1960s light, bright nouvelle cuisine. He finds two of nature's most fragrant fruits, one sweet (strawberries), one savory (tomatoes) and doubles down on the perfume by matching them with a gazpacho of the same ingredients. The next minute he's all cuisine classique, scooping up sweetbreads the texture of pudding and serving them tableside in such a generous wash of tarragon cream sauce that it would constitute a serving of chowder in lesser restaurants.\",\n",
       "  \"Then comes a hat tip to slightly more recent times. Rose grills lobster tail to the firmness of prime rib, scents the shellfish with its own oil, and matches it with cool Bibb lettuce, basil, candied lemon, and a hot grilled tomato. The presentation is very 1980s steakhouse, stark and with the sauce on the side. And in this case it's a traditional sauce Lauris, a mix of paprika and mayonnaise made famous by the extant Guy Savoy.\",\n",

It's not Señor Frog's, but it's a heck of a lot more transportive than The Industrial Chef's Table Restaurant or The Generic Hotel Restaurant. Ornate chandeliers — 11 of them — plus face-height candles on every table, gold-rimmed martini stems, and sofa banquettes impart the room with a level of opulence that is part Russian oligarch, part Beauty & The Beast.\",\n",
       "  \"Rose built a fully open kitchen, lacking a firm boundary with the dining room; line cooks work behind bespoke Athanor ovens, donning those two foot-high toques they wear in culinary school subway ads. The chef has spoken of making Le Coucou a Lutece of its own era, a callback to Andre Soltner's venue that was equal parts haute cuisine and high society hangout, but Major Food Group's Goodfellas-esque Carbone, a Michelin-starred update to the Italian-American chophouse, really is the better point of reference.

It's not a bad thing in an era where where newer restaurants are feeling increasingly uniform in their offerings.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a bromide to say what's old is new again, so let me put the wonders of Le Coucou in the following empirical context: It really is a commentary on the staid state of cooking in New York that one of the most refreshing piscine preparations I've had in quite some time is Rose's halibut in (the once ubiquitous) beurre blanc, the lean flaky fish elevated to heart-clogging bliss with enough emulsified butter and wine to cover the entire plate. Underneath the filet lies a mound of daikon sauerkraut: a tart, translucent not-quite-kimchi to wink at modernity before a diner drags it through all the fat.\",\n",
       "  'The caviar course is a staple of any grand French restaurant. This indulgence typically involves about 30 grams of fish roe over ice and starts at well over a hundred bucks. At Le Coucou, the barrier to entry is lowered in exchange for a smaller portion. Cost: $38 for a coral-colored pile of golden osetra atop veal tongue. The soft meat gently warms the firm roe, helping release its briny overtones, while the caviar in turn salts the delicately flavored tongue. It evokes an era when caviar was plentiful enough to season a dish, rather than being marketed as the star of a composition.',\n",
       "  \"Le Coucou is obvious in its luxuries: Lobster appears in three appetizers, foie gras in two, Wagyu in one. But their use isn't always obvious. The Wagyu is not steak, but rather tripe; it's been soaked, braised, fried, and laid over a brunoise of pickles and olives. Think of the crispy organ —\\x80\\x94 a style of stomach not uncommon in Lyon — as a fun French analogue to a Japanese pork tonkotsu.\",\n",
       "  'The wanton maxim \"to share,\" commonly deployed by restaurants to justify the $150 chicken, isn\\'t found on the Coucou menu, but perhaps it should be, as all of the fairly-priced mains are arguably portioned for two.

It tastes of concentrated ocean and salt and sun-baked algae. You use a ladle to retrieve more broth from a Mauviel copper pot, which you pour over a delicate slice of black bass. You spoon a swath of aioli into the soup, dampening the littoral funk, but stinging the palate with garlic.',\n",
       "  'No ile flottantes or oeufs à la neige grace the dessert menu, and rightly so, as such ethereal creations would be redundant with the savory quenelles.

It\\'s very tricky to explain why this place is good enough to deserve a review but not quite good enough to get up to the next level.\" The problem, of course, is that a vast number — perhaps a majority — of restaurants deserve one star and even aim at it. They are often enjoyable and budget-friendly, but lacking the desire to dazzle. Here are three restaurants worth reviewing that merit a single star.',\n",

The brief menu specializes in the northern Chinese street crepes called jianbing, which here go by the rather unfortunate name of Beijing burritos ($7).

Nevertheless, a careful choice on your part makes an agreeable snack; the crepe featuring smoked salmon, wasabi, cashew cream, and pumpkin seeds is the best.

Sahib is the sixth in a group of restaurants owned and overseen by chef Hemant Mathur, though it was originated by Bollywood actor-turned-restaurateur Shiva Natarajan, who remains a consultant.

The menu receives its greatest inspiration from that land of mountains and mists.',\n",

Other regional dishes are similarly transformed. In palak paneer, a Punjab staple, a slurry of flavorful spinach is surmounted by browned balls of ricotta, suggesting a nascent Indo-Italian cuisine. Similarly, Banarasi eggplant, from the northeastern Indian city of Varanasi on the Ganges River (famous for its burning ghats), is improved by loading the familiar vegetable curry into a smoked eggplant skin.

Leuca is the first Brooklyn restaurant by Andrew Carmellini, one of Manhattan’s most notable Italian-American chefs. Leuca, located in Brooklyn, arguably this country’s capital of pizza, is the first Andrew Carmellini restaurant to regularly serve pizza. Leuca, a big-deal Manhattan chef’s first restaurant in Brooklyn, a borough known for its restraint and respect for the past, serves its Neapolitan pies at the bottom of a chic new hotel where a two-night weekend stay runs about $800. Takeout is not available, which is just as well, because Leuca does not make terribly good pizza.',\n",

In the years since he’s branched out to launch his own empire. His restaurants (with one exception), aren’t so much groundbreaking as they are reliably delicious, which is no less a virtue: He hawks fare like malty fleur de sel pretzels at Lafayette, saucy \"grandmother’s ravioli\" at Locanda Verde, and a dish of linguine with four cloves of garlic at Bar Primi. He’s done well with reliably delicious.',\n",

This is the festa de maiale, a suckling pig whose skin is aggressively bronzed and whose somewhat unevenly cooked flesh is disappointingly under-salted. A pool of caper honey adds a touch of sweet zing to the musky flesh, but really, for $72 (this is the restaurant’s most expensive dish), you expect more careful cooking and seasoning. Large format dishes like this one make up half of the menu’s six mains; if you’re not dining alone, you can enjoy a $48 chicken for two (remember when chicken used to be a solo item?) and a $68 lamb, and if you’d like to bring the sharing ethos with you into the dessert course, an oversized riff on an affogato called the Sophia Loren.',\n",

That chicken for two, for example, is prepared \"rosalina\" style (this turns out to mean lemon and oregano). Lobster \"in purgatorio\" is a basic chile-and-butter topping for the crustacean; about par with a similar version I had at a restaurant I stumbled across in Washington back in 2002. And steak \"vesuvius\" takes the form of a New York strip topped with a cross between a salsa rosso and a romesco sauce; the garnish is a brilliant balance of heat, acid, and sugar, but the thin, under-charred, one-note beef diverts this interpretation of the Italian-American culinary experience through a detour at Applebee’s.',\n",

He’s served mind-bending riffs on that matchup at his other restaurants, sometimes adding a bit of chorizo or bacon jam for smoky, spicy overtones.

He also gives New Yorkers what might be our thousandth iteration of sea urchin spaghetti over the past twelve months, which would be fine it it were an improvement upon all the rest. Sadly, Lecua’s feels as if it were slicked with Elmer’s glue.',\n",

There, Carmellini’s kitchen espouses a style of multiculturalism — a Latin-inflected take on tripe, Korean-inspired fried rice, matzoh ball soup, lamb neck mole, Caribbean goat pie — that still feels ahead of its time. Looking at the lay of the land in North Williamsburg, whose string of capable restaurants nevertheless feel somewhat monochromatic, and where there’s no shortage of Italian options, it’s hard not to wonder if the Dutch would’ve been a better fit.

The raw tuna with green olives, chile, and crispy farro is serviceable, while the obligatory smoked beets taste like a phoned-in dish that couldn’t quite fit on the menu at Little Park, Carmellini’s lovely, vegetable-heavy hangout in lower Manhattan. The one don’t-miss dish is Leuca’s riff on Caesar salad: a mound of fire-roasted cabbage leaves, charred and then enlivened with lemon, parmesan and anchovy.',\n",

Just the first bite, though — the rest of the dish revealed itself to be strikingly unbalanced. The noodles are malfadini, long ruffled ribbons, cooked to an al dente density that almost feels like udon. The kitchen tosses the strands in a rapini pesto, twirls it all together in a bowl, and garnishes the verdant pasta with viridian sweet-and-sour peppers: all the colors of the Italian flag in a bowl. The first bite is truly stunning, a shock of bitter from the broccoli rabe offset by the sugars and acid of the peppers.',\n",
       "  \"But as you eat more, you’ll realize the sauce is a touch heavy, perhaps because the pasta isn't hot enough. And there aren’t quite enough peppers to include them in every bite, which means that the pesto’s bitterness starts to prevail, and the dish loses its footing. In the end, I found myself dredging the noodles through the remains of my starter of ricotta dip, though not voluntarily: Our server failed to change out the share plates between courses.

But for now, I’d advise patrons to skip Leuca’s generic dessert offerings, from the supermarket-bland chocolate pudding, to the $11 cheesecake that’s leaden as any version sold under glass at a neighborhood diner.

As summer approached, the windows were flung open to the Lower East Side’s warm breezes and Gonzalez started experimenting with salads and savory dishes, eventually adding them to the menu. Soon, the tiny place was mobbed with a crowd that seemed mostly models and food writers. I found myself meeting friends there for lunch upwards of once a week.',\n",

Topped with pink pickled onions, its clash of colors knocked your socks off. An equally surprising salad featured chicharrones de harina (a pig-skin substitute), while a chia-seed pudding glowed red and white with pomegranate and freshly shaved coconut.

Many have had the experience of going to a steakhouse, plunking down $75 or so, and getting more steak than you could ever eat or fully enjoy. For $15, Gonzalez offers an assayable portion of New York strip: 3.5 ounces of dry-aged meat sliced and topped with crunchy and spicy hazelnut oil. Really, even that quantity is enough to share between two people, proving that eating steak is all about concentrated bovine flavor, rather than sheer quantity.',\n",

       "  'One day, to establish a flavor baseline for the city’s hummus, I hopped on my bike and pedaled to several iconic spots. The weather was sweltering, the perfect time to test the creamy chickpea dip redolent of wind-whipped sands and the merciless desert sun. My first stop was Taïm, a small storefront just off Perry Street specializing in flavored falafels run by Israeli chef Einat Admony. Pooled with olive oil and rimmed with sumac, the hummus was liquid and salty and nutlike. It was tendered with a pita brushed with olive oil and za’atar that served as the perfect flavor foil. At historic Mamoun’s on MacDougal Street — where hummus was popularized in the ‘70s, becoming an instant hit with students, vegetarians, and bohos — the product was pastier and more richly flavored, tasting pungently of cumin, lemon, and garlic, though the cardboard pitas were a disappointment.',\n",

Founded a decade ago in the East Village, it was one of the first places in town to suggest that hummus could be the centerpiece of an entire menu — an idea that Dizengoff was later to adopt. At Hummus Place the product flaunted its slippery texture and strong olive oil taste, but offered little else in the way of flavor thrills. Which brings us to the whole point of this round-up. Several times sitting at Dizengoff’s curving red counter I’ve heard customers exclaim, \"This is the best hummus I’ve ever tasted!\" And I wondered, \"Could it really be the best?\"',\n",

New York’s Dizengoff seats around 20 at a counter that undulates alongside a kitchen with a flaming metal oven. Above the counter are ranked cans of Israeli pickles. But the oven is the center of attention, and from it fly thick and lightly charred pitas that vie with the hummus as the most important part of the meal. They arrive steaming, packaged in formfitting paper bags.',\n",

In fact, as you sit mopping it from the inside of your black plastic container with a torn fragment of pita, it threatens to detach itself and ascend to the ceiling. Yes, it’s the best hummus in town. In addition to the flatbread that comes alongside, you also get a chopped Israeli salad, a slender cucumber pickle or two, and some house-pickled onion swatches that, as the counter guy hastened to tell me one afternoon, \"should be used as alternate scoops for the hummus.\"',\n",

This is the responsibility of chef/partner Emily Seaman, who, in the early days of the Chelsea Market Dizengoff, was seen heroically pulling pitas from the oven. (When she’s not making them, they are sometimes not as good.) Five hummus variations priced from $10 to $13 are available, but part of the genius of the place is that the roster is always shifting, making a visit to Dizengoff a culinary adventure. Many, like tahini, fava beans, or a soft-boiled egg (which sometimes comes with potato chips) are entirely predictable.',\n",

If you’ve gotten the idea that Dizengoff is a vegetarian joint with lots of vegan options, you’re right. But additionally offered is one meaty topping per day, at the highest price tier. In the early days it was lamb. Which was also a bit of a disappointment because it was lamb stew rather than a charcoal-grilled kebab, which is the more conventional accompaniment. Currently, the choice is coarsely ground chicken in red oil with Persian spices, which is beyond delicious. In fact, it’s my favorite topping of all those I’ve tried over the last four months.',\n",

There’s also a rotating selection of composed cold dishes, called salatim ($4 each, 3 for $11 with pita). These run from the exciting (matbucha, a braised tomato salad) to the not-so-exciting (stewed cabbage, wherein the vegetable was undercooked, making it a slog to eat).

But Bloomfield taxes the wallet: She sells her namesake burger for $25 — and that's without fries, which at $7 a la carte bring you up to $32. That's as much as you'd pay for Minetta Tavern's dry-aged, butter-drizzled Black Label burger, or two dollars less than the famous foie gras-stuffed sirloin patty at DB Bistro Moderne.

Sure, Minetta and DB Bistro deserve credit for convincing diners to cross that $30 burger rubicon, but those extravagances are one-hit wonders.

And at the Ace Hotel lobby (where I'm a regular), she serves what might be her most underrated dish, a greasy blend of massively flavorful beef topped with intensely salty bacon and cheddar so aged that the taste is almost sour.

To Bloomfield, the burgers are composed entrees. At the Breslin and the Pig, they're among her most accomplished yet most affordable mains — just $25, and that's with fries.

It begins with a tiny danish filled with coffee-spiked cream —\\x80\\x94 alone, this would be a magnificent snack, but High Street's in-house bakers up the ante, garnishing it with country ham that's ruffled like an ornamental porcine flower. And the finish? A dusting of parmesan, like powdered sugar. So there you go, all the components of a proper European breakfast, minus the cigarettes, with a nod to the American south. The resulting combination of textures and sweet-savory flavors — caffeinated cream, musky pork, chewy dough, and MSG-esque fromage — is one of the city's best new pastries.\",\n",

       "  'Kulp took an unconventional approach to opening his New York restaurant. Rather than kicking off with dinner and then waiting for the reviews to pour in, the venue debuted with breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and then added on nighttime hours a month later. High Street, in other words, was almost instantly an all-day brasserie, a risky move for such a young venue.',\n",
       "  \"Of course, staying open throughout the day can help any young restaurant meet its financial obligations more quickly. At least, theoretically. The downside can be enormous: higher labor costs if guests don't show up (there's no captive hotel audience here), greater opportunity for errors amid the increased offerings, and a staff that will almost surely be overworked, no matter how deep the bench of cooks and waiters.\",\n",
       "  \"And yet, High Street pulls off the all-day experience with aplomb. No, the 60-seat spot doesn't quite have the space (or the wifi) to act as a true third space between home and work, the type of venue like Lafayette or the lobby at the Ace where four-tops can drop by for coffee only and end up spending an entire Saturday afternoon typing away on their MacBooks. But you can usually snag a stool behind High Street host stand and spend an hour or two during a slow lunch sipping a cortado and reading the paper. And for those who are skeptical about the usefulness of an institution where the brunch waits can exceed an hour, consider this: a dedicated takeout counter gets patrons in and out in under 10 minutes, even during peak hours. Not even a busy bodega can always accomplish such speed.\",\n",

Another clutch choice is the sliced turkey: The kitchen cooks the fowl so gently and cuts it so thin it practically dissolves in your mouth like pâté.

Such a dedication to the craft of leavening is a true luxury in this era, when so many in-house bakery and pastry programs have been on the chopping block, an easy operation to cut in the face of rising costs.\",\n",

We read reviews for vicarious experience: What is it like to snag a seat at a pizzeria that only doles out tickets via email once a month? We read reviews for context on the larger culinary world: Is fine dining broadening its appeal by taking inspiration from street snacks, or simply putting itself further out of touch by charging top dollar for things that used to be cheap?',\n",

To narrow the list, I look for stories that speak to the state of dining in the city right now. Sometimes those stories are obvious (l'll cover a buzzy new venue like Quality Eats to see if justifies the epic waits for walk-ins) and sometimes these stories are less obvious (I'll reexamine Brooklyn Fare because it's transformed itself from a BYO tasting table into one of the city's priciest experiences).\",\n",

David Chang's restaurants get plenty of attention from the press, and there's a reason for that: the 38-year-old is one of the most influential chefs of his generation. He's responsible for transforming the humble Taiwanese steamed bun into an object of universal hipster desire at Noodle Bar, and he's trying to do the same with the spicy fried chicken sandwich at Fuku. He helped popularize, at Ssam Bar, the now-ubiquitous phenomenon of serving upscale share plates in stripped-down environments for a few dollars less than elsewhere.\",\n",

It's the company's first new, full-service New York restaurant in five years, and it's espousing a style of multi-cultural mashup that's new to the restaurant group. Italian-inspired dishes fortified with Asian ingredients is a model New York has seen before, at venues like All'Onda and Basta Pasta, but Chang is pushing the envelope a bit harder here. His kitchen replaces the anchovy in bagna cauda with fish sauce, for example, and the butter with walnut puree, and the result is pretty rad, the loose, funky crumble of the nuts evoking the coarse texture and umami of parmesan.\",\n",

Like any professional follower of restaurants, I'd seen the slideshows of Nishi's interior — there's a whimsical painting of a woman in a bathing suit riding what appears to be a post-nuclear apocalypse monster bicycle — but still, I was surprised by how spare the room felt in person, boasting none of the modest comforts that Chang has been leaning towards lately, at Ko and elsewhere.\",\n",

But the hozon replaces the gorgeously stinky overtones of pecorino with a marked sweetness, one that the warming pepper more or less manages to keep in check. (A little finishing salt, provided upon request, helps even more). It\\'s a dessert pretending to be a savory pasta, and it\\'s absolutely majestic.',\n",

What makes Nishi so exciting is that Pinsky is forcing New Yorkers to look beyond the framework of regional Roman or Sicilian traditions (or American red sauce affairs), and to meditate upon the fact that Italian food can be just as compelling when it's completely (and sometimes unrecognizably) interpreted through the eyes of another culture or chef. Nishi's food rebels against the shackles of authenticity.\",\n",

Sure, that's perhaps one more cocktail than the average dinner order, and yes, a zero-gratuity check is always going to be higher than one without. But still, instead of seeing the inconveniences and unpleasantness of the dining room reflected in a lower cost on my bill, I was paying close to fine-dining prices for the opportunity to sit on a seriously uncomfortable stool for the time it took to eat three courses and linger over a drink, and stare at a wall.\",\n",

That's why critics visit more than once, and why we usually wait a while for a restaurant to find its groove.

You may have encountered it at an affordable French bistro, but it's almost never spotted in a steakhouse setting. The importance of this can't be understated: Quality Eats is forcing the modern meat eater outside of her high-flying comfort zone, depriving her of New York strips and Tomahawk chops. And it's making that bump back to cattle class more attractive with a discount, the $19 you'd spend on that bavette would, at Minetta Tavern, barely buy you a beet salad.\",\n",

Stillman fils inherited the family propensity for steakhouses, giving the world Quality Italian (a chophouse that reads like a more corporate Carbone) and Quality Meats, the Midtown restaurant that sells 64-ounce cuts and ice cream by the pint, and which loaned its name (while withholding a key consonant — the M is scratched out in the logo, and conspicuously absent above the restaurant's door) to Stillman's latest endeavor.\",\n",

But all costs are rising, and they're rising for everyone —\\x80\\x94 labor, benefits, real estate, ingredients —\\x80\\x94 and the restaurant industry is adapting.

It's surprising that the genre has shown such intransigence in adapting to the financial straits of aspiring gourmands, in giving anything more than a curtsy toward our (nominally) healthier culinary zeitgeist, or in addressing the disparity between waiter pay and cook pay.

Sometimes it really works: Dishes like glutinous rice cakes or octopus huaraches are absolutely brilliant; the former act as a pleasant conduit for a spicy broth, while the latter is all soft cephalopod and pure corn bliss.

Inverse al pastor is the name, making it perhaps the first taco to take its cue from the formal language of logic. \"A basic formula for creativity is to change the proportions,\" says the 35-year-old, who speaks in the tone one might expect from a Yale chemistry professor lecturing to a crowd of three hundred. Stupak, in this case, is speaking to four people.',\n",

And as you eat, you start to come to terms with the following: That the final savory course of an expensive tasting isn't a cumbersome protein meant to be cut with Laguiole knife but rather a fruit taco whose sauces are meant to dribble down your chin. That this Mexican-inspired affair is the only non-Japanese omakase where the primary utensils are your hands. That pineapple with lardo manages to be a more savory expression of what you've always imagined to al pastor to be. And that Stupak, the guy who hawks nachos on St. Marks Place and guac in the West Village, has earned a spot as one of New York's most exciting tasting menu chefs.\",\n",
       "  \"When a high-tech chef rides into town to cook for a night or two – be it Grant Achatz, Jordan Kahn, or Albert Adria – Empellon Cocina is frequently where the action takes place, and with good reason: aside from Stupak, there aren't a whole lot of modernist-trained chefs running their own restaurants in the Big Apple.\",\n",
       "  \"New York is indisputably one of the dining capitals of the world, but it's never really been a global destination for the type of experimental cuisine found in Barcelona (Tickets), Bray (The Fat Duck), or Chicago (Alinea). Our neo-classical city, with teems of bankers itching for protein-heavy client dinners, has a solid track record of sending avant-garde spots to the grave, from Varietal (mushroom desserts), to Corton (sashimi-stuffed cotton candy), to Sam Mason's Tailor (bubble gum cocktails and spherical veal), to WD~50, the Michelin-starred purveyor of pizza pebbles, knotted foie gras, coconut egg whites, and carrot juice yolks that employed Stupak as pastry chef for four years.\",\n",
       "  \"Perhaps the memories of a recession-era battering (along with rising labor costs) have prompted New York restaurateurs to channel more of their creative juices not into their cuisine but rather into their business models, with chefs toying around with no-tipping policies, lightly-staffed fast casual spots, and tiny stalls in epic food halls. Stupak's kitchen counter, accordingly, is not a separate restaurant, but rather four seats in the back of his East Village Cocina. Every spot is paid for in advance via the Tock ticketing system, at $95 for the 6 p.m. seating, and at $165 for the longer 8 p.m. seating. Translation: If no one shows up, the restaurant still makes money, and if no one books, Stupak still has a larger a la carte venue to run.\",\n",

The clean, cold consommé of halibut, lime, tomato, and soy shocks the palate into action. And shortly afterward your tongue is set ablaze by a poblano pepper jelly, a dangerous surprise hiding underneath a tame panna cotta. There's your reimagined, retextured rajas con crema. \",\n",

They\\'re not an uncommon ingredient in New York\\'s Mexican restaurants, but at tasting menu venues, bugs are somewhat of a rarity. Stupak crushes them up with a mortar and pestle. \"They taste more like celery salt this way,\" he says, using the smashed remains to garnish a single bite of fried chicken wing. Delicious. But if you don\\'t dig it, another course is minutes away, perhaps blood sopes anointed by heady boudin noir; both the corn cake and the sausage crumble in the mouth like a musky, offal-y brownie.',\n",

Shorter menus typically breed more conservative preparations – a chef has less room for error because of a higher price per course. Longer menus, by contrast, allow for more risk, as a dish that doesn't work is forgotten nine courses later. Stupak, to his credit, balances this gastronomic philosophy with the more pragmatic reality that people occasionally want more than a single bite of something. So instead of sending out a never-ending supply of wedding buffet-sized hors d'oeuvres, preparations grow and shrink throughout the meal, a little bit of palate teasing here, a hint of hunger sating there. A ten bite plate of celery root sashimi with coconut cream and chile ash mayo – an abstract study in black and white – is followed by a poached oyster topped with nixtamalized popcorn kernels – simple food that just tastes good.\",\n",

Here's what's less familiar: Super Bowl party-worthy masa waffles with chicken liver butter, or a tiny mousse-filled puff whose magnified flavors of dairy and corn feel like a gordita-esque hat tip to golgappe, the yogurt-filled Indian street snack. Then there's the classic Oaxacan black mole, which comes not as a chicken smothering sauce but as a star ingredient in its own right, an inky ice cream whose warming spice contradicts its cool temperature. A plate of prune sorbet with agar agar spiraled chocolate ganache appears soon after – followed by orange sorbet in gossamer gellan gum tuiles (edible cones as thin as Saran Wrap) – and you start to wonder whether you're back at WD~50.

And as New Yorkers increasingly fly to Mexico City to splurge on elegant tasting menus (or spend $125 per person at Cosme in the Flatiron), they\\'ll learn to dispense with the rosy eyed myths of authenticity and let Mexican food continue to do what cuisines hailing from countries with Michelin stars are allowed to do: evolve.

A bevy of neighborhood women — Salvadoran, Dominican, and Mexican — assisted Chavez by cubing the pork, perpetually stirring the pot, and performing such other tasks as hand-forming the picaditas — ridged masa discs tailor-made to hold the soupy carnitas.',\n",

Price rises, certainly, but would she go the route of chef Cosme Aguilar at Long Island City’s Casa Enrique, who created a bistro-ized menu featuring ceviches, composed salads, and showy regional dishes from his home state of Chiapas? Or would she stick with the same bodega menu from small-town Atlixco, in Puebla, that she had mounted in Mott Haven, keeping the full-meal prices in the teens, rather than offering entrees in the mid-20s, as Aguilar did?',\n",

Order an entrée, and you get a fully loaded plate at a bargain price. Many of the main courses are the same as those presented in the Bronx. There are meatballs stuffed with quail eggs, served in a zingy tomato sauce; a mole poblano more nutty than sweet, poured over cheese enchiladas or a quarter chicken; pork ribs and purslane in a green salsa more tart than hot; and — a weekend favorite back home in Puebla — great gobbets of the funky lamb steamed in banana leaves, called barbacoa.

You may scratch your head and wonder why a cafe mimicking the menu of a home kitchen in Puebla would offer such Americanized Mexican food as burritos, but this is part of the democratized feel of the place.

       "  '\\n  Fifteen years ago an LA friend introduced me to the pleasures of scarfing noodles on Hollywood Boulevard. In the area known as Thai Town, the restaurants were quite different from the ones here in NY. Sure, New York has Isan places serving the fiery salads of northeastern Thailand, and khao soi cafes from the Chinese-leaning city of Chiang Mai. We have restaurants slinging the curries and basil stir fries of central Thailand, some focusing on Bangkok. And we have places like Pok Pok and Kiin Thai that take a scholarly pan-regional approach. But those Hollywood stars concentrated almost exclusively on noodle soups. My mind was blown.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'It’s been possible to find a few dishes on most Thai menus in town typical of those served at places like Hollywood’s Sanamluang, but nothing like its collection of 20 or so noodle entrees. Until 2014, that is, when Pye Boat Noodle appeared in Astoria. The lively place is tricked out like a tropical Quonset hut — all waffled metal, louvered typhoon shutters, and worm-eaten wood. The uniformed waiters are sassy, the service fast, and the food inexpensive.',\n",
       "  'Like the heroine of Brian De Palma’s Carrie, you may encounter pig blood. It’s an important component of boat noodles with pork ($9.95), also known as nam tok. The \"boat\" part refers to sampans that ply the waters of Bangkok’s canals, where the dish was invented in 1942. Like floating McDonaldses, they ladle out fast food, in this case rice noodles in a slightly sweet broth darkly flavored with soy sauce and blood, jumbled with sliced pork, pork meatballs, and crunchy pork rind. Blood makes the soup richer. In Bangkok you’d also get some offal, but who’s complaining?',\n",
       "  'Above: Drunken noodles with beef and papaya salad. Below: Boat noodles with pork. [Photos and lede image:\\xa0Tanya Maithai]',\n",
       "  'The menu fills out with other street-style noodles, both brothed and sauced. For lovers of the color pink, there’s yen ta fo noodle ($10.95), seething with shrimp, shrimp balls, fish balls, squid rings, and frilly white fungus in a  too-sweet chicken broth thickened with bean paste — which is where the color comes from. If you prefer dry noodles without soup, then bamee phoo moo dang hang may be your thing. Egg noodles something like curly packaged ramen are tossed with thick slices of pork belly and shreds of crabmeat. Handfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro provide verdency in this dish often peddled in Thailand from carts late at night.',\n",
       "  'A similar noodle joint with the hippie-sounding name of Plant Love House opened on Elmhurst’s Whitney Avenue near the end of 2014. Competing with a half-dozen other Thai cafes in the immediate vicinity with more predictable menus, it never quite developed the following it needed to succeed. So it boldly picked up and moved to Brooklyn, to the Prospect Heights restaurant frontier of Washington Avenue. Cryptically changing its name to Look By Plant Love House, it mounted a similar noodle-focused menu in a deep space with two cramped dining rooms (sit in the front barroom instead), a premises that had failed as several previous establishments, including a clam bar and an Italian restaurant with Israeli flourishes.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, the food now is spectacular, perhaps a notch above Pye Boat’s. Boat noodles (guay taio num tok, $11) remain the flagship, here with more piquancy and with blood that seems better integrated into the broth. (There are no tiny clots around the rim, as at Pye Boat). If you’ve previously experienced tom yum as a small bowl of forgettable soup served as an appetizer, you’ll sit up and take notice of Plant Love’s rendition. In a broth propelled by lime juice and fish sauce swim all sorts of proteinaceous ingredients, plus a bonus fried wonton and lots of crushed peanuts. You won’t know where to start. Ask for it \"Thai spicy\" and it will leave you gasping between spoonfuls.',\n",

One is khao pad tom yum goong ($12), a umami-exploding fried rice cooked with shrimp paste. It comes cheerfully bannered with cucumbers and cilantro.

       "  \"Capital of the landlocked Telangana state, Hyderabad has in recent years transformed itself into South India's Silicon Valley. Perhaps some of that newfound wealth has found its way to Jersey City, because the India Square neighborhood has lately been hopping with restaurants inspired by the techie powerhouse. Over the last few years several newcomers have focused on biryani, including Paradise Biryani Pointe, Biryani Pot, and Bawarchi Biryani Corner. While this decorated rice dish at least partly inspired by Middle Eastern pilaf is common in northern India, it's also the signature of Hyderabad, which has a unique Muslim history.\",\n",

We're not talking dosas and idlis here (though many cafes in Jersey City peddle those), but a whole other catalog of South Indian regional cuisines. One of the restaurants is called Hyderabadi House, with the same owners as Sri Ganesh's Dosa House, just across the street. You might have expected the new joint to also be vegetarian, but far from it. Hyderabadi House serves up excellent goat biryani and goat curries, in addition to kutt mirchi (fiery green chiles fried in a chickpea batter) and eggs put to surprising uses, including an egg masala that immerses the boiled variety in a rich peanut gravy.\",\n",

Golconda means \"shepherd\\'s hill,\" and refers to a citadel on the edge of Hyderabad that was once the seat of a medieval sultanate; now it lies in ruins, all coruscated walls and arched passageways rising in tiers against the cliff, furnishing a spectacular view of the city to the east. Golconda Fort was once the center of India\\'s diamond trade, and the name has come to symbolize vast wealth.',\n",
       "  'The restaurant is handsome and somewhat luxurious, with flagstone wainscoting doubtlessly intended to symbolize the fort. The place seats about 80 in a deep, sparsely decorated room. Golconda Chimney offers a more sophisticated take on the cuisines of Hyderabad and South India than the other restaurants in Jersey City. In fact, it deserves to be counted among places like Indian Accent, Babu Ji, and Tapestry that are lately heralding an Indian dining renaissance in New York City. In contrast to those other places, though, the food tends to be more assertive and more highly spiced, perhaps because most of the patrons are South Asian, while Manhattan restaurants often tone down their spice palettes for a mixed audience.',\n",
       "  \"If you're a goat lover, Golconda Chimney is for you. On its sprawling 18-page menu, 17 selections incorporating the horned and sure-footed beast are listed. There's a goat biryani ($13.99), of course, featuring succulent boneless pieces among the spice-scented grains, with a boiled egg perched like a bulbous white bird on top. It comes sided with thick yogurt raita. Also worth trying is goat sukha, a bony mass in an oily chile bath that makes it seem almost Sichuan. Gnaw away!\",\n",

Native to the city, dum ka murg ($14.99) immerses bone-in chicken morsels in a mellow sauce thickened with cashews and chironji (seeds of the Buchanania lanzan tree, which taste like almonds). Such ingredients, exotic to most New Yorkers, abound at Golconda Chimney, where every meal is an adventure in culinary geography. But one of the best chicken dishes comes from the Indo-Chinese canon: Chicken lollipop ($9.99) features the drumstick with the flesh pushed to the top, tinted bright red and fried, with just a hint of heat — like Buffalo wings with an Indian twist.',\n",

Back then, Batali and Bastianich were the top players in Manhattan’s white-hot Italian renaissance, and their newest establishment, Del Posto, would go on to become one of the city’s most heralded culinary establishments.',\n",

Batali and Bastianich had brought New York into the era of regional Italian fare, but the evolution kept going: from the haute red saucery of Carbone, to the quirky \"Cheesus Christ\" pizzas of Roberta’s, to the wood-fired lamb steaks of Lilia. The landscape has evolved, which makes the question of La Sirena, the latest Batali/Bastianich endeavor, a fascinating one. Can two of the city’s great Italian restaurateurs return to the forefront and wow us with a Tao-sized Italianate hangout, conveniently located directly above the actual Tao?',\n",

In case there’s any doubt about the gravitational forces exerted by Mario Batali, the lower Chelsea/upper Meatpacking neighborhood, or the Maritime Hotel itself, let me clear things up: At any given night at La Sirena, a restaurant spanning the length of a full city block, with 210 indoor seats and a hundred more outdoors, the whole place is packed. Patrons dress as if they’re going clubbing after they finish their sugar-dusted bomboloni (made by former Le Bernardin pastry chef Michael Laiskonis), clad in leather pants, leather jackets, leather dresses with leather epaulettes, and see-through blouses.',\n",

You pick it up with a firm grip, because the entire concoction feels as if it weighs six pounds, and you sip, via a metal straw, a liquid that evokes the sensation of putting your face over an alcohol-filled humidifier. The drink is a triumph for vodka as a neutral spirit, but a failure as a cocktail that will cost more than most late-night cab rides. I sampled it alongside an inconsistently butchered short rib carpaccio that, depending on the bite, exhibited the texture of perfect raw beef or of dry-aged Saran Wrap.',\n",

There’s the creative Batali that we know. The kitchen slathers caserecce pasta (a cousin to fusilli) with a gossamer coating of broccoli rabe pesto, chiles, and sesame, imparting the noodles with an assertively nutty and exhilaratingly bitter finish.

While Shake Shack sells a double patty stack with a gorgeous griddle char for $8.75, La Sirena uses onions, a potato roll, and mozzarella to mask two grey pucks that that have seen less salt than a communion wafer, served with under-crisped fries.

In the timeline of New York restaurants, Babbo is an essential precursor to restaurants like Momofuku and the Spotted Pig, serving up some of the city’s most iconic and creative pastas, at relatively accessible prices, to a soundtrack of Eminem and Led Zeppelin. In his 2004 review of the restaurant, then-New York Times critic Frank Bruni cited Babbo’s choice of music (and the volume at which it was blasted) as a reason for withholding a fourth star from the venue.

I watched a patron carry three cocktails as he walked from the bar to the lounge, a difficult task because most humans only have two hands; he passed by three waiters, none of whom offered any assistance. I almost walked out one night when, after being seated just after 10 p.m., a server didn’t ask what we wanted to order until nearly 10:30 p.m. On a Saturday at brunch time, I watched a waiter squirt green juice into shot glasses from a drippy squeeze bottle and deliver it as an amuse to every table but mine.',\n",

Canora then adds turmeric, black pepper, and marrow, and ladles your serving into a aqua ceramic bowl, which you're instructed to pick up with your hands and drink from directly. The bronze-brown liquid smells of dry-aged beef. The collagen makes your lips stick together. The peppers warm your throat. It doesn't exactly whet the palate; rather, it snaps the senses back into focus after the dulling effect of the short walk in 10-degree windchill that brought you to the restaurant's door. This is, ideally, how you begin every meal at this brick-lined, dimly-lit neighborhood gem. It is transportive.\",\n",

       "  'Hearth opened in 2003 as a partnership between Marco Canora, the opening chef de cuisine at Craft, and Paul Greico, the goateed former wine director of Gramercy Tavern. (Greico left in 2014.) The cuisine was seasonal, Tuscan-inspired American fare, with intricate charcuterie boards, hearty ribollitas, earthy mushrooms, filling bollito mistos, and lush ribeyes for two.',\n",
       "  \"Things were great. Until they weren't. Over the years, Canora saw his rent rise by 65 percent. He was overweight. He was diagnosed with gout. And as guests who've sat at his chef's counter can attest, when things didn't go right in the kitchen, he occasionally did his best impression of Gordon Ramsay, shouting and cursing at underperforming cooks.\",\n",
       "  'But according to Canora (who has recognized me on every single visit I\\'ve made to his restaurant), he managed to turn his health around, curb his temper, and keep his business afloat, thanks to — well, thanks to soup. He started hawking the stuff (he calls it \"brodo,\" a nod to Hearth\\'s Italian influences, though it\\'s more commonly identifiable as bone broth) out of one of the restaurant\\'s window in 2014. The Today Show aired a segment. Epicurious called it the new coffee. The New York Times compared it to the other haute addictions du jour, coconut water and green juice. People came in droves.',\n",
       "  'Then in early 2016, Canora closed Hearth for a week, nixed traditional appetizers and entrees on the menu in favor of au-courant share plates, expanded the offerings to better reflect the healthful, nutrient-dense ethos of his beloved brodo and, in the end, debuted a slightly more comfortable room to match the resulting slightly higher cost of dining.',\n",
       "  'This isn\\'t a \"they replaced Shea Stadium with Citi Field\" renovation. Changes are subtle. Only regular guests of the old Hearth will notice the changes. The bar up front, formerly slate, is now jade marble, and the chef\\'s counter is now butcher\\'s block (I\\'d happily sleep on both). There\\'s a long, soft leather banquette along the north wall, and the old rust-red ceiling is now painted an airy white. The pendant lamps might be new, but the lighting is still gentle enough to flatter your paper-thin radishes served over buttermilk, the gentle fats of the dairy softening the spice of the kaleidoscopic roots.',\n",
       "  'Canora has long championed a narrative of enlightened gastronomy. Bar coasters at the original Hearth were emblazoned with Depression-era government mantras: \"Save what will keep, eat what will spoil.\" At Hearth reborn, Canora doubles down on that ethos. The back of the menu is printed with a 13-section mission statement that touts a ban on \"lions of the sea\" (swordfish, for example, is off the bill of fare); pledges support for the local greenmarket over the allure of \"certified organic\"; champions fresh fats (\"we change our fryer oil every day\"); and encourages everyone to eat offal, by way of a cute little story about a cheetah slaughtering a gazelle for its bloody organs.',\n",
       "  '\"In the simplest terms, we only use meat from happy, healthy animals,\" reads the menu, a statement that would come across as a bromide if not for a more compelling truth that Canora doesn\\'t publicize: The chef doesn\\'t like how many young calves are weaned on powdered milk, and so Hearth has, for the time being, eliminated veal from what might be its most famous dish, the ethereal ricotta meatballs, which are now made with beef.',\n",
       "  'Another rule: \"We mill our own flour and polenta from intact, non-GMO, heirloom varieties.\" Canora, true to form, puts his money where his mouth is. He cracks his own rye berries for for a red-cabbage-topped porridge (he calls it \"risotto\") that boasts the the texture of coarse polenta and that explodes with the flavor of caraway seeds. He grinds whole grain for toothsome homemade rigatoni, dressed with a pork ragu whose deep flavors linger like mole. And he breaks down buckwheat for pizzoccheri - short, earthy tagliatelle that stand up to stinky, stretchy fontina and heady mushrooms better than standard-issue semolina pasta ever could.',\n",
       "  \"Hearth still sells its famous gnocchi, which dissolve in the mouth with all the ease of pommes purée. Just one tweak: Canora switched to a local, small-production outlet for his all-purpose flour. And the butter coating those gnocchi, like all of the restaurant's cooking butter, comes from grass-fed cows, a pricey product that elsewhere might only be reserved for formal bread and butter. These under-the-hood changes contribute to the moral integrity of the revamped restaurant, and they also have a noticeable impact on a salient part of the Hearth experience: dining here now, you'll likely spend more than you would have last year.\",\n",

Small plates add up, and it's likely that a proper dinner for two will exceed $100 per person after tax and tip. But it's worth it; the price is in line with the high quality of the food that Canora and his chef de cuisine, Luigi Petrocelli, are sending out. (The better deal, for those willing to give up a bit of control, is the six-course, $78 tasting, drawn from the a la carte menu.)\",\n",
       "  \"Still, some of Hearth's portions are tiny even by small plates standards. A crispy-skinned cod square served with kale is, improbably, as indulgent as collards with ham hocks, but you're paying $26 for a fillet that's not much bigger than a deck of playing cards. Mackerel, illogically served in a bowl (please don't serve things that need to be cut in bowls), with an almost invisible layer of shellfish cream, delivers about three flawless bites of deliciously oily flesh for $21. Better bang for your small-plate buck comes in the form of pork belly, shaved like carpaccio under a rainforest canopy of fennel. It's a modestly sized plate, and with good reason: too much more of this salty, herbaceous bliss and the palate would go utterly dead.\",\n",

Three large slices of Sullivan Street sourdough arrive with a trio of dips: grassy butter, fruity extra virgin olive oil, and smoky whipped lardo from, to borrow Canora\\'s words, \"good clean pigs.\" A generous portion of carrot and beet tartare never seems to end, perhaps because the bland creation doesn\\'t pack the same complexity as the foie gras or trout roe-laced versions at Little Park or Semilla. Instead, try the tart grilled cauliflower over a mash of smoked, shredded trout, a functional one-plate meal for $16.',\n",
       "  'But the king of Hearth is cow. There are no traditional steaks on the menu, so you get your bovine fix from a few weighty slices of beef neck. The meat is braised, but the cow\\'s grass-feeding (and barley finishing) means the lean cut has a heft that\\'s closer to a firm filet mignon than it is to the short rib of a more conventional corn-fed steer. The flavor is concentrated, and doubly so when you drink the clear \"sauce,\" which isn\\'t a reduced braising liquid but rather — there it is again — Canora\\'s beef brodo.',\n",

The \"Variety Burger\" is a medium-rare patty made from a coarse grind of brisket, chuck, heart, and liver. It\\'s served with sweet potato wedge fries (heresy!) and without a bun (hiss!). The lack of bread means there\\'s nothing but a slice of melted fontina and a heap of caramelized onions to soften the organ meats\\' clean, ferric blow. It is, without a doubt, the biggest risk a New York chef has taken with a hamburger since Daniel Boulud stuffed one with foie gras and truffles over a decade ago, and it\\'s easily one of the standout dishes of the year.',\n",

Still. Canora deserves credit not just for turning his health around, but for keeping a neighborhood mainstay open and relevant in a city that eats up and spits out so many young venues a year in — let alone a dozen.

Uruguayan-born chef Ignacio Mattos —\\x80\\x94 who'd been unceremoniously canned from his previous gig at Isa, one year earlier —\\x80\\x94 was now visible through Estela's kitchen door, enthusiastically making small, quirky dishes so intense one or two were enough. In fact, friends and I developed the habit of sneaking into the place around six in the evening, just before it got slammed. We'd sit at the bar and knock back a glass of wine and a vinegary mussels escabeche on toast, or a bright red beef tartare crunchy with sunchokes.\",\n",
       "  \"So, if you're Mattos and partner Thomas Carter, what do you do for an encore three years down the road? The answer is, you let the pendulum swing in a more conservative direction, highlighting bankable rather than groundbreaking. Hence, Cafe Altro Paradiso, which partly functions as a surprisingly conventional Italian restaurant. Seating around 90, the U-shaped, high-ceilinged room sits behind a sliver of park at Spring and 6th Avenue, a non-neighborhood whose main commercial denizens are an outsize Trump hotel condominium and the modernistic new God's Love We Deliver.\",\n",

The room sports industrial light fixtures overhead that, when you've had a few glasses of wine and your head lolls back, make the place seem like a bus depot. As befits a depot, the noise level is deafening.\",\n",
       "  \"My first meal was not inspiring. A few days after opening, the place was already mobbed, and a companion and I were seated at a bottleneck near the greeter's podium. It was like being in a small boat in rough seas, as we were jostled from every angle. What's more, a pair of short plates proved disappointing, more so since they seemed like Estela rejects: a puny octopus tentacle waving in a stubble of chickpeas and a beef carpaccio laid like a wrinkled hanky across a few slivers of potato chip. Modest in size, both dishes were priced at $18.\",\n",
       "  \"But on subsequent visits, the better selections fell into place like a well-dealt hand of cards. And, with aid from chef de cuisine Aidan O'Neal, Mattos' genius was once again on display. The best starters cover the plate like an abstract canvas. A fluke crudo ($16) intersperses limpid swatches of raw fish and caper berries, irrigated with pungent olive oil; burrata flattened like a schnitzel plays tag with cured lemon rind and market greens; and a simple pork sausage poises like a blimp fallen from the skies next to a hedge of cooked greens.

Nevertheless, the coppa (a neck-meat salumi, $13) is so flavorful and nicely marbled, it shouldn\\'t be missed. \"Is this made in-house?\" I asked the waiter one evening, expecting a \"yes\" as I dabbed the grease from my lips. \"No, it comes from Salumeria Biellese in Chelsea,\" was his forthright reply.',\n",

Four or five in number on a series of menus, the pastas ($19 to $27) are small for the price, making sharing difficult. Simply stuffed with scintillating ricotta, the half-moon ravioli are invariably a good choice. One evening they were sauced with verdant nettles, and on another occasion, stuffed instead with prosciutto, they shone in a broth with fresh favas.

These curvilinear flatbreads made from rice flour and coconut milk are leavened with microorganisms that descend from the air, yeast, or sometimes toddy, a palm-based wine .

The recipe involves lime juice, chiles, ginger, and other flavorings; as with sushi, it originated as a method of fish preservation. Less satisfying in this context is San Rasa\\'s plain chicken curry, which is a little too low on zing to complement the bland hoppers.

But take a high-end stem —\\x80\\x94 a Zalto, for example. At just over half the weight of an iPhone, you barely notice it in your hand. The lip rests against your mouth with all the heaviness of a doily. And the bowl, which looks thinner than gossamer, boasts sufficient magical aromatic properties to make a bottle of Blue Moon drink like one of the world's most fragrant beers. The extravagant cost of each stem (about $60) keeps glasses of this quality confined, for the most part, to the country's priciest establishments. And yet, when you're led to your table at Pasquale Jones, a damn good Neapolitan-style pizzeria in Nolita, there's a Zalto waiting at each place setting.\",\n",

Wisps of broccoli rabe, doing their best impression of seaweed, are strewn about, providing a gently bitter counterpoint to all the salt and fat. You eat this quickly, then reset the palate with a $28 glass of Bereche bubbly that's so tangy and light in your Zalto that it feels as if you're using a pencil sketch of a glass to drink a cumulus cloud.\",\n",

A bespoke floral arrangement flanks the south side of the dining room, and an artful arrangement of rhododendrons liven up a loo that's decked out with Jo Malone candles, Aesop hand soaps, and fruit-flavored Tootsie Rolls.\",\n",

But right now in New York, both pizza and wine have grown up, and at pizzerias like Marta and Roberta's, thin-lipped glassware — not to mention funky biodynamic wines or deep selections of grower Champagne — is more common than not.\",\n",

But here\\'s what\\'s even better: Pasquale doubles down on that emerging great-wine-for-everyone ethos with a plan to lure in both the snobs and the amateurs by serving their pizza-friendly vino in some of the world\\'s best glasses — but also by making it ultra accessible, with any of the non-sparkling \"seasonal\" wines (of which there are 56, none over $75) available by the half-bottle for half the list price. That\\'s a rare and generous policy, one that translates into a path to sampling that Manzoni for as little as $35.',\n",
       "  \"The obvious benefit is to the diner's wallet, but there's something more important going on here: Pasquale is lowering the barrier to entry to trying an off-the-beaten track wine not just from a financial perspective but from a consumptive perspective. Just as a chef has more opportunities to try and fail with experimental dishes over a long tasting menu, rather than having to play it safe over a four-course meal (where, due to the limited scope, each course has to knock it out of the park), an aggressive half bottle program encourages diners to take more risks while drinking.\",\n",

But as much as the sports-jacketed sommeliers at tasting menu venues are changing the way fine-diners drink by expanding wine pairings to include sherries, sakes, beers, cocktails, and mocktails, the waiters in denim shirts at Pasquale are changing the way pizza-eaters drink by using the pies to get us in the door, and exposing us to wines we've never heard of.\",\n",

Those scented candles in the bathroom? They're a reprieve from the woodsmoke gently perfuming the dining room. Hosts check your bags without giving you a ticket; they remember who you are. About a third of the dining room is available for booking via Resy, and if that's how you roll, you'd best log on to the app a good two weeks out, when seats are released. The rest of us will wait about 60-90 minutes as walk-ins.\",\n",

Nearly every version is perfect, from the brilliant clam and amatriciana pizzas to the margherita pie, whose tomatoes exude aromas that veer from sweet and easygoing to vegetal and tangy. The spicy salami pizza is the requisite pepperoni riff, with the clutch inclusion of Calabrian chiles. They look like chopped up cherry bombs and impart the pie with the type of deeply funky flavor one might expect if a farmer were to water his vegetables with lamb broth. Match that with a half bottle of Vignai Da Duline Schioppettino, with its reserved dark fruit notes, and you've got yourself a nice segue to the mammoth pork shank for two, a mound of achingly rich, fall-apart swine.\",\n",
       "  \"The precision of Hardy's non-pizza kitchen doesn't quite approach the wonder of his pizzas, technically or creatively, but the fare is enjoyable enough. The pea salad with ricotta is fresh and bright, steelhead crudo shows off the oils of good trout, a dish of braised leeks with walnuts and parmesan packs about as much flavor as a decent delivery salad. Pastas are distinctly average, from the gritty, overcooked, undersalted Roman gnocchi, to porchetta agnolotti, which takes two powerful flavors — black garlic and braised pork — and somehow makes them almost unnoticeable. Chicken is overcooked, and tilefish is a study in how to drown delicate maritime flesh with too much olive oil. It's as if Hardy's approach to non-pizza cuisine is to create a subdued canvas that won't get in the way of the wine, which universally has far more personality.\",\n",

Perhaps you never went in the first place, because you thought a $1,000 dinner date was elitist and foolish. But many of you indulged. Per Se, after all, wasn't a Lamborghini, an out-of-reach-acquisiton that makes the buyer look like a jerk; Per Se was a night out to see Hamilton: a cultural phenomenon that middle-class food-o-philes saved up for. It was a place to understand old French indulgences (foie gras, truffles) and to seek fluency in new American luxuries (sous-vide short ribs, cryovac melons). Then the prices went up and the food went downhill. The New York Times published a devastating pan, and this critic said the tired cuisine was about what one would expect out of a high-end shopping mall. It all raises the question: Where does one now splurge for a crash course in modern fine dining? Simple: You visit the only major Kings County restaurant with a no-jeans policy.

A layer of trout mousse underneath coats your palate, tempering all the unctuous excess. This is when you realize that chef Cesar Ramirez is subtly telling you that he can do better than Keller.

As rooms shrank, the number of courses seemed to grow, giving risk-taking chefs more room to experiment. This reality, alas, also produced syllable-sized dishes served at such a rapid pace they sometimes felt like real-time slideshows of food, edible press releases designed to be instantly preserved in the electronic amber of Instagram.

Ramirez, late of Bouley, pitched up to thirty courses of French-Japanese fare at a breakneck pace. The tone was dinner-party strict. Ramirez would wait until everyone quieted to announce each course. Guests who were twenty minutes late would find themselves seven courses behind. (I once double fisted a few bites to catch up.) No pictures or note-taking were allowed; when I asked about this a few years back, Ramirez just smiled and quipped, \"I just want everyone to leave their guns at the door.\" The lack of a liquor license meant diners brought their own wines, chilled their own wines (you had to make cute little snow mountains with crushed ice to chill the bottlenecks), and poured their own wines. And this was all okay, because dinner for two wouldn\\'t run more than $500.',\n",

Dinner is now $306 per person, service included, which means a fully-loaded dinner for two, with beverage pairings, can scratch at $1,000. And that's okay, because while Per Se, at $325, has done little to merit its increasingly higher prices over the years, Brooklyn Fare has transformed itself from a lean, underdog chef's counter into one of the city's most comfortable and compelling expressions of haute cuisine.\",\n",

That's hugely important if you believe that Ramirez's cuisine deserves a place in our ongoing culinary conversations, a tough standard to meet for a chef with no cookbook to reinforce our memories of his delicacies, few media appearances to tout his likeness, and a strict photo policy that keep his innovations somewhat under the radar.\",\n",

Fairytale eggplant, roasted to the texture of slow-cooked bananas, derives its sweetness from cashew butter, its verdant bitterness from roasted shishitos. If the chefs put it all on bread, they\\'d have an A-grade PB&J. And then there\\'s compressed watermelon with lardo, roasted okra, pickled okra, and poblano emulsion, a sweet-sour-spicy-fatty affair that\\'s straight up Paul Liebrandt — which is to say an outstanding combination of ingredients that no inside-the-box chef would think to put together.',\n",
       "  \"David Chang, an original gangster in serving high-end (yet affordable) food in cramped, noisy spaces, would be proud of the Bruno boys. Surely no other U.S. restaurant utilizes a more painful counter stool. Designed by Repucci himself, they lack both lumbar and pediatric support. Your feet dangle and knock up against the poorly-spaced bar wall, and I'll bet Air Turkmenistan has more legroom than this. The lighting is cafeteria bright, meaning the environs are more conducive to food photos, less so to first dates, or lingering.\",\n",
       "  'You don\\'t tip at Bruno, where servers are paid an hourly wage. Such policies are increasingly common at tasting menu spots like Atera and Brooklyn Fare, but still rare at the casual, a la carte level. Amanda Cohen\\'s affordable Dirt Candy is an exception in that regard, and Repucci\\'s conversations with Cohen informed his decision to do away with gratuities at Bruno. \"We both agreed that tipping is racist, sexist, etc., and doing away with it seemed the best way to simplify things and potentially pay cooks a little more for all their hard work,\" Repucci says. The fairest way to eliminate tipping is by raising prices, a practice that lets diners know how much they\\'ll spend without having to do any mental math. \"But then our prices would be 20 percent higher than everyone else’s.\" Indeed, a service-included policy would push Bruno\\'s margherita pie from $15 to $18. So instead, the restaurant levies a 20 percent administrative fee, which more or less functions as a mandatory tip. Will Bruno eventually go full-on service-included? \"I think eventually, as more restaurants move to no tipping, the consumer’s pricing perception will change and restaurants will be able to just have higher menu prices,\" Repucci says. Right on.',\n",

Rounds of Caputo Brothers mozzarella sport a welcome, almost toothsome chew. This isn't milky mush; this is cheese, dammit. Then there's the fruit. The chefs use a blend of fermented and canned tomatoes, with the vine itself steeped into the juice, creating a marked pucker and a distinct vegetal perfume that's aggressively headier than standard pies. A whisper of garlic, a hint of dried clay pepper, and a wallop of basil stimulate and sharpen the palate, cleansing it for more pizza eating. This all lies on top of a gently sweet whole wheat crust the thickness of two credit cards, with just a hint of droopiness and – as is increasingly common in New York – no Neapolitan-style soupiness. It's as close to margherita perfection as I've encountered in over a decade.\",\n",

Lamb pie, covered in coppa, is a clean expression of farmland funk. Pepperoni pie, in turn, introduces a wild card into the mix: ranch dressing, a high-end take on the fringe movement that involves Americans dunking their hot pizza in cool, spiced buttermilk. At Bruno, the effort is more subtle: the ranch is an elegant finishing touch, something to gently reduce the tang of the tomato, with a clean dill-infusion playing foil the porky sausage.',\n",

The chef, who prepares my entire meal with no assistance, fans his charcoal behind the counter, wondering if I\\'m going to eat. The setting is the months-old reboot of Tori Shin, a stunner of a skewered meat spot in Midtown West. I can hear the din of the regular dining area, which is packed. But in this more exclusive area, curtained off like a first class airline cabin, I\\'m the sole guest. The bill of fare is a $140 tasting of chicken parts, surely the most expensive poultry omakase in New York, if not North America altogether. Chef Atsushi Kono has already fed me whole hearts from six pound birds, slices of loin as medium-rare as Minetta steak, and something called main artery, which looks like what would happen if Steven Seagal plunged his hands into the neck of a live rooster and ripped out its carotid, just because. All of these preparations are delicious. But now Atsushi has upped the ante. He places a skewer in front of me. \"Knee bone,\" he says. Am I really supposed to eat the bone? He smiles. \"You eat the bone.\"',\n",
       "  \"The skewer contains four ostensibly edible knobs. They have not been braised, liquefied, or pulverized, nor have they been boiled into a clear consommé or a milky tonkotsu.

But it's somewhat unexpected when offered as part of pricier, multi-course meals like this one. Instead of caviar, we're serving kneecap tonight. Despite the city's ongoing craze for paleo broths and crispysardine skeletons, chicken bones haven't really earned a spot on hip Brooklyn menus alongside tripe, feet, and other in vogue off cuts.\",\n",
       "  'I start to gnaw on the ossiferous treat. The bone goes SNAP between my molars, shattering like a under-licked gobstopper. Japanese menus sometimes refer to this delicacy as \"soft\" knee bone, but rest assured, it is not soft. \"We like the crunch,\" the chef tells me. So do I. The bone has no flavor. It is pure texture. It is the adult equivalent of a child eating a plastic Happy Meal toy, minus all the digestive repercussions. It is one of the final frontiers in honoring an animal that unwillingly sacrificed itself for our enjoyment. It is, without question, one of the reasons why Tori Shin remains the city\\'s best and most ambitious yakitori joint.',\n",
       "  \"Remains is the operative word because Tori Shin has been going at it since 2007, when Atsushi (along with owner  Shu Ikeda) set up shop on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It was a small poultry blip in a pre-crash New York overrun by pork belly, steakhouses, and pan-Asian stadium spots. I started visiting in 2012, not too long after Michelin awarded it a coveted star, and found that Tori Shin was unquestionably serving some of the city's finest (and most expensive) chicken tastings. Problem was, the cramped room felt as inviting as a dragon roll sushi shack. So in June, Atsushi relocated to West 53rd, transforming the ground floor of an apartment building into the more sedate fine dining establishment that Tori Shin always deserved to be, and giving this casual stretch of Hell's Kitchen, peppered with Korean and Japanese pubs, the high-end spot it has long needed.\",\n",

A rectangle of a window overlooks a \"zen garden\" out back; consider it a verdant counterpoint to the gloriously greasy chicken, served in hues of brown, khaki, ochre, and tar. One exception to that color scheme, however, is the tenderloin, grilled to such a creamy white it could seek camouflage in clam chowder. Take a bite. The interior is as rare as barely-cooked tuna.

An entry level tasting for two at Tori Shin, after all, will cost less than a large format tomahawk steak at American Cut. That New York can sustain such a restaurant is testament to our increasing tolerance for elevating foods that don\\'t have a deep history of being elevated.

Once inside, find well-spaced tables in a square room with walls painted a garish shade of orange.

A hollowed-out lime peel bobs on the surface, blue flames licking upward. \"What\\'s in the lime peel?\" I asked the waiter. \"Bacardi 151 proof,\" was his reply.

       "  'Following the departure of Jeremiah Tower in 1978, Jonathan Waxman went to work at Alice Waters’ Chez Panisse. It was already America’s most influential restaurant, the one where contemporary ideas about fresh, local, and farm-driven were first hatched. Waxman exited Berkeley and went downstate in 1979 to help found Michael’s in Santa Monica, one of L.A.’s most revered restaurants of the era. If you want to know what those early days were like, read Ruth Reichl’s Comfort Me with Apples, in which Waxman figures prominently. But these were mere prelude to what was to follow — his departure for New York in 1984, taking the seeds of the cuisine he helped create with him, and planting them in the rich soil of the restaurant scene here during one of its most opulent periods.',\n",
       "  'Founded in 1984, Jams was an instant hit, capturing not only the essence of California cuisine, but its insouciance, as well. The centerpiece was a grilled chicken-and-fries entrée that shocked everyone with its price tag of $23, but additionally causing a sensation were red snapper ceviche, crab cakes with corn-and-tomato salsa, and, especially, tiny pancakes served with smoked salmon, crème fraiche, and yellow whitefish caviar. New York had never seen a restaurant quite like Jams, causing Bryan Miller to coo in the Times, \"Of all of the trends that have sprouted in New York City in recent years, however fleeting, one that has thrown strong roots and become part of the landscape is so-called California cuisine.\"',\n",
       "  'On this wave of approbation, Waxman opened two more restaurants in New York and another Jams in London. Then came the stock market crash of 1987, and suddenly high-rollers with expense account money drifted away, and Waxman’s empire was wiped out in the blink of an eye. The peripatetic chef returned to L.A. for a while, then reappeared in New York, where he worked behind the scenes on several restaurants without much visibility. At times he seemed only partly engaged in his restaurant career, staying out of the spotlight for years at a time.',\n",
       "  'Finally, his fans cheering on the sidelines, he dove into the pool again, opening Washington Square Park in 2002 on Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. Of it, Bobby Flay — a Waxman protégé — enthused in a New York Times interview, \"When I walked into the restaurant the other night, it seemed like it was Jams in the year 2002, elegant but casual. He has his open kitchen again. He always had all-star teams working for him, fabulous cooks.\" The next year Waxman opened Barbuto (\"beard\" in Italian) on the ground floor of Industria Superstudio, a complex of photo studios aimed at the fashion industry, on the southern edge of what would become known as MePa.',\n",
       "  'Washington Square Park is now long closed, but Barbuto persists. And just this year Waxman opened a new Jams, just off the lobby of 1 Hotel Central Park. Now, with two restaurants in New York at the same time, it’s beginning to seem like 1984 all over again.

Not only did models mince down the adjacent ramp from the overhead studios, they were seated among us in skimpy dresses, their lips glinting with lip gloss. Nowadays the crowd is older and stodgier, many of them condo dwellers and townhouse owners from the surrounding hood, but the restaurant is still thronged at all hours, and reservations must be made weeks in advance.',\n",

When the place first opened, the bearded and curly headed Waxman was to be seen wrangling poultry. Served with an Italian salsa verde redolent of anchovies and capers, the half chicken is every bit as good as it ever was, perhaps better.

It’s a big bird.',\n",
       "  'My second favorite thing came as a surprise. A kale salad ($12) featured the intransigent leafy vegetable chopped so fine that it slid down the gullet smoothly, its slightly bitter edge concealed by plenty of salty pecorino and saltier anchovies, with a squirt of sweet honey.

Waxman’s bucatini all’ amatriciana ($21) is one of the best versions ever tasted, each perforated strand carefully coated with a bright sauce made with fresh Jersey beefsteak tomatoes, a sprinkle of grated pecorino on top nailing the flavor. This is Italian cooking with a California twist, a cuisine that L.A. chefs like Nancy Silverton, Wolfgang Puck, and Mark Peel (one of Waxman’s associates at Michael’s) have been exploring for decades, and one to which Waxman has added impressive innovations of his own.',\n",
       "  'Yes, over the years Barbuto has only gotten better, with a practiced crew in both the front and back of the house who have learned every trick to what makes a restaurant great. And the recent sale of Industria Studios, leaving the fate of Barbuto up the in air, means making what may be a last visit only more imperative.

Jams is now classified as an amenity, like a lobby with wifi or a spa in the basement. The high-ceilinged room is attractively lined with wood and hung with Edison light bulbs, and the chairs that surround a multiplicity of square tables have a groovy 60s feel to them. Shelves of alcohol bottles are positioned above a long, long bar, solving someone’s storage problem. An open kitchen lurks in the deepest recesses of the restaurant.',\n",

Our tastes have collectively changed since then, principally through the incorporation of culinary principles espoused by Waxman and his California pals 30 years ago, now incorporated into every menu in town and become keystones of the foodie philosophy. Soon after Jams 2.0 opened, I sat there with a bunch of colleagues from Eater (including three critics, who managed to remain anonymous) and pondered this truth, as we ate our way around the menu. We paid special attention to the handful of dishes that had been transferred nearly intact from the original menu at Jams.',\n",

It set us wondering if the smoked salmon used at the original Jams might have been sourced at Russ & Daughters or Barney Greengrass.',\n",

More than once we endured a 30-minute interval with no food brought out at all. The dishes readily divided themselves into good and awful. An ample bacon cheeseburger ($21), named after the restaurant and listed as a bar snack, was fat and juicy and required frequent visits to the cloth napkin, while an oblong pesto-and-goat cheese mini-pizza tasted more Greek than Italian; it was delicious, though, with its smoky crust. Squid ink rigatoni with crabmeat was too al dente, the underdressed noodles black and glistening with not enough crustacean. The worst dish of 11 sampled was a bone-in pork chop cooked like wiener schnitzel, overcooked, really, into an almost-burned toughness.

The tiny pork belly tacos ($19), though, were thoroughly delicious — accompanied by one teacup of smashed avocado and another of pico di gallo made with perfect ripe tomatoes. The biggest disappointment was an entrée called mezze ($23), which connotes a set of Greek or Middle Eastern starters that often include baba ganoush, hummus, and tabbouleh.

So how can such an ideal site be blighted? SenYa lies directly across the avenue from Sushi Dojo, which caused a furor two years ago when it opened, not only due to its piscine innovations and uni obsessions, but also as a result of its chief itamae's ethnicity. Can a Floridian of French-Moroccan descent make great sushi? Decidedly so.\",\n",

It's also generally less expensive (though both offer an omakase of 10 pieces for $45), with a wider variety of options, both at the sushi bar and in the kitchen. Mostly eschewing clams and other shellfish, SenYa's omakase favors fin fish, which are often local and off the beaten path as far as the usual sushi selection goes. Served on two sequential pieces of slate, the sushi comes out pre-seasoned, so that no soy sauce, wasabi, or even ginger are really required. Sometimes the flavoring consists of a little hillock of finely chopped scallions; sometimes a slice of green chile, a drop of ginger-carrot emulsion, or a sliver of black truffle.\",\n",

The lid is put in place and pressure applied. After it achieves firmness, the solid block is removed and cut like a cake into bite-size pieces. This sushi doesn\\'t strive for the lightness of nigiri sushi, but flaunts its rich density. Of the three types offered, best is orange sea trout ($18), with skin that glistens a rainbow of colors.

Located in a wide and deep corner space, it previously housed a liquor store with Plexiglas barriers and a fine selection of half-pint pocket flasks. Now, the front and side walls have been flung open to late-summer breezes, the ceiling paved with nostalgic stamped tin, and a wood-burning beehive oven installed mid-restaurant.

This $16 bowlful of sunshine features perfectly cooked crustaceans heaped on chunky yellow grits, around which a flavorful reddish-brown broth swishes. So far, it’s a pure evocation of a famous Southern dish. But The Heyward embroiders on the regular recipe by substituting chorizo for bacon, then nonchalantly tossing some shishito peppers on top. Though decidedly non-doctrinaire, this version is one of the finest the city has seen since Edna Lewis left. (Shrimp and grits was a cornerstone of her 1976 landmark, The Taste of Country Cooking.)',\n",

The seats are comfortable and adult-sized; some are even padded. \"Is this place aimed at an older crowd?\" A friend inquired as she scanned the laid-back space, where she saw four divided dining zones, one of which provides stools along a semicircular counter looking into a chef’s work area that is more theater than conventional kitchen.

At The Heyward, heirloom field peas and Carolina gold rice from Anson Mills are used, the way Sean Brock does it at his celebrated Charleston restaurants. Additionally, a piece of seared and browned pork belly is laid across the top, in a salute to Brooklyn’s favorite part of the pig. A contrasting dish substituting sunnyside-up eggs for pork belly appears on the brunch menu. Both are worth ordering, with the beans displaying assertive savor.',\n",

Paradoxically, most of the Lowcountry standards are found in the appetizer and side dish sections of the menu. That’s OK, because it’s easy enough to make a meal out of small plates. In addition to the shrimp and grits and hoppin’ John, one might include the sweet-corn-and-pimento succotash (which is not really succotash, because where are the lima beans?), the fried green tomatoes (they recently disappeared from the menu, but will hopefully reappear once summer returns, or the green-tomato truck rolls in from Florida), and the excellent cornbread, which might be mistaken for fine cake.',\n",

The thick pork chop on a gravel of heirloom carrots is tasty enough, but the hanger steak ($27) hides its few sliced pieces in too much salad for the price, and the roasted cod entrée is just plain dull.

Though I don’t usually bother with brunch (broken Hollandaise provokes my gag reflex more certainly than any other substance), I did have a wonderful dish one Sunday morning at The Heyward.

New York’s Bois Verna once boasted bookstores, churches, cafes, and bodegas called petit magasins. One of the only institutions remaining is Le Soleil (\"The Sun\"), a restaurant founded in the early 70s by Rolande Bisserth, cook and owner, on a busy stretch of 10th Avenue just north of 57th, where cabbies and limo drivers often double-parked to hurry in for carry-out.',\n",

The thing takes a lot of tenderizing to be palatable, and Haitian cooks are experts at it. At Le Soleil the shellfish is fricasseed in a vinegary pink solution as beautiful as the shell. It’s probably unlike anything you’ve tasted before and a big raw onion ring rides on top.',\n",

The same very French treatment is afforded goat (cabrit), beef (tasso de boeuf), and turkey (tasso dinde) with similar results. Pork is still the best, with turkey second. Love goat?

The stylized notices, whose mechanical fonts and faded colors evoke a 1976 algebra textbook, contain little more than a date, an illustration (an angry bear, a headband-clad karate dude), and a restaurant name. A jolt of energy courses through your veins when you recognize the visitor; an even bigger one zaps you when you don't: Souvenir, Septime, Catbird Seat, Taco Maria, Maaemo, Bones, Sudestada, Commis, Fish & Game, In De Wulf. Naturally, you email to request a resy and you’re told that a little over a hundred bucks gets you a tasting menu from a chef whose establishment would’ve cost a thousand plus in airfare and hotels. And this is when you start to realize that behind all the chic graphic design lies one of the city’s most vital restaurants.\",\n",

No other New York culinary institution — except maybe Ssäm Bar — so consistently showcases out of town talent at such reasonable prices; Chateaubriand's Inaki Aizpitarte (under whom Stone worked) swung by this month to serve pork rinds showered in ceviche granita and shelling beans doused in elderflower butter — part of a ten-course repast for $120. And for non-guest chef nights, (which, alas, are most nights), the kitchen charges just $67 for an edgy, foamy, seven-course affair, a heck of a deal in a year that’s seen oodles of new venues where dinner for two will easily hit $500.\",\n",

An art student can peruse Picasso’s blue period via Google image search. But a young chef will have a heck of a time enjoying Grant Achatz's modernist cookery without visiting Alinea and plucking down $700 on a dinner date. And while none of this is to discount the importance of empiricism outside of cuisine (better to step inside Philip Johnson's glass house than view it from your buddy’s Facebook feed), with food you actually have to be there. You can’t eat via the Internet. Further limiting is the fact that the gastronomic game is a zero sum; your enjoyment of lemongrass-flavored ants at Noma (where von Hauske worked) will detract from someone else’s because the chefs there can only forage for so many insects, and because the restaurant only has so many seats.\",\n",

It's a spicy tuna roll, the bane of sushi purists, transformed into toast, the oft-mocked lifestyle choice of people who brunch in 2015. If the concept reeks of Dada-esque self-awareness, the execution is pure deliciousness: crystal clear notes of fish oil and spice, begging for a funky glass of sparkling rosé.

Beef tartare matches Estela's in its umami-rich elegance: Piedmontese top round gets amped up by a crack mix of pimenton oil, horseradish, buckwheat groats, and smoked cheddar shaved with as much abandon as white truffles at Per Se.

This dish, however, deposits chicken in a bright tomato sauce tinged yellow with turmeric and flavored with aniseed and curry leaf, among many other spices. The main flavoring, though, which makes you sweat from the heat as you gobble the curry, is cracked black peppercorns. Using peppercorns rather than chiles indicates that this recipe probably originated before the 16th century, when the Portuguese introduced chiles to India.

Smart diners will ask for seats at that counter and avoid the tables. Sushi, after all, is a performance art, and because each morsel is so small and ephemeral, much of the enjoyment comes from the build-up, from watching a chef slice the cool fish, anneal it, in an almost magical slight of hand, to a mound of warm vinegared rice, and place it in front of the guest. Good raw fish joints are compact enough to allow such spectating and interaction, while at larger ones, the chef will often reposition himself in front of the intended recipients.\",\n",

Those sitting at the north side of the counter often won't see anything until a slice of hamachi with banana pepper mousse appears on a plate delivered by the server. It will still be delicious, with the pepper cutting through the fattiness of the rich fish. But it's sushi that's missing half its narrative, an admittedly nitpicky issue that nonetheless feels amplified at these prices.

And while that's less than what you'll spend in Boston, where the longer menu is $285, O Ya is still markedly spendier than in vogue sushi spots like Nakazawa ($150) or Shuko ($135-$175).

Since the early days of Northeast Kingdom, this neighborhood’s been the one to watch in Bushwick. Faro is named using a creative spelling of an heirloom grain that has been re-popularized lately. A cousin of wheat comprising several wild species, farro was prized by the ancient Romans. Faro’s unusual formula emphasizes heirloom grains; a wood-burning oven; seasonal produce, boutique meats, and local seafood cooked in that oven; and a supreme dominance of pastas. Take that, carb haters! A few secondi fill out the menu, making the place seem a little more Italian, though it really isn’t. Let’s call it an Italo-hipster hybrid.',\n",

This former sculpture storage space for MoMa is characterized by high ceilings, lots of tables, and a circumferential banquette. There’s a long bar in front, at which you can eat in an orange glow as the sun sets on the murals, metal recycling depots, artists’ lofts, and small manufacturing facilities in the immediate area.',\n",

As the dish sailed in, the appearance was striking: a mass of white foamy whey seething atop a fine-textured brown gruel, with a ring of glinting olive oil splashed around the edges. Dipping down into the depths one pulled up bright green peas like some unidentified swamp plant. The porridge was mellow, the peas almost unspeakably sweet, and the whole thing mind-bogglingly good.',\n",

Now the peas are sadly gone, to be replaced in the porridge by curls of summer squash and a fried squash blossom, offering one of summer’s best crunches.

The wood-burning oven often sees service where vegetables are concerned. Delicate charred asparagus debuted in late spring well-buttered and tossed with crabmeat; Faro is certainly not a place that fears dairy.',\n",

But it uses no actual squid. The ink makes the pasta richer, an effect that’s goosed up by a sauce of curried coconut milk. We are already in nutsy pasta territory here, but a half lobster tail and claw flopped on top makes the dish even more surreal — it’s a pasta Salvatore Dali might have invented.',\n",

In the early days, Kevin, the chef, sent out maple syrup-spiked pastrami (better than Katz\\'s), grilled cod collar (nicely fatty), and best of all, raw hamachi with trout roe and jalapeno — a dish imbued with so much oil and heat it tasted like what would happen if a Michelin-starred chef took over Guy Fieri’s test kitchen.

The noodles, of course, are thin, almost angel hair-like, to absorb all the succulent juices. And while the Ippudo version sometimes leaves a whisper of sediment on the palate, I didn’t experience any of that at Mu. The finish was soft, vaguely sweet, and lingering.

       " ['Just before the turn of the last century French food in New York had fallen on hard times. Where once great Gallic behemoths like Lutece, Le Cirque, and La Cote Basque dominated the fine-dining landscape, these places were overtaken with a great whoosh by neophyte New Italian and New American establishments. A great Tuscan craze swept the restaurant industry, emphasizing fresh pastas, seafood, and vegetables in simpler, lighter preparations. Heck, these ascendant cuisines were practically sauceless, decreasing cost and prep time for restaurants increasingly plagued by cash-flow problems. But the tide was bound to turn and French food is making a comeback. With a modern twist, upstarts like Cherche Midi, Lafayette, and Dirty French have ushered in a new age of culinary opulence.',\n",
       "  'Mid-priced French bistros are beginning to bounce back, too. While we’ve retained a slender collection of old guard bistros, new ones are materializing, recalibrated to hold their own in today’s small plate and wine bar culture. One such restaurant is Le Baratin (\"The Sweet Talk\"), with a smirking fox logo that seems about to holler, \"This is an ideal place for romantic seduction.\" Le Baratin is located in Greenwich Village, once a hotbed of casual French restaurants. And the place has a pedigree: brothers Michael and Cyril Touchard, two-thirds of the ownership, grew up working with their parents in the Theatre District’s oldest bistro, Tout Va Bien. Like the proprietors of old, they personally tend the bar and patrol the dining room waiting on customers.',\n",
       "  \"The décor might be termed Parisian kitsch: bicycling jerseys descend from the ceiling, dimpled banquettes march along one bare-brick wall, original works of art alternate with colorful advertising posters, and strings of tiny lights twinkle over the bar. The bill of fare incorporates French standards, but also features a sprinkling of Italian dishes such as gnocchi and pizza. Comprising nine sections, the menu juggles all the classic hors d'oeuvres, cheese and cured-meat platters (that’s the wine-bar angle), and steaks and seafood, among such hoary bistro commonplaces as coq au vin and beef bourguignon.\",\n",

       "  'You could do worse than order that old warhorse, steak frites ($32). Instead of slinging a rubbery and inexpensive hanger as bistros traditionally have done, Le Baratin fires up a New York strip, consciously treading on steakhouse turf. Well-marbled and tender, the thing comes smothered in a green peppercorn sauce with a bit of piquancy to it. Welcome back, sauces! The accompanying french fries are superb – scraggly, salty, and slightly greasy. Once the steak has been demolished, there’s nothing better than sopping up the last of your sauce with these unruly fries.',\n",
       "  'Other classics find themselves remade in smaller ways. The salade Lyonnaise ($12) topped with a poached egg comes with way more bacon lardons than is traditional, with the dressing toned down so the vinegar doesn’t burn your lips. Call it a tamed frisee salad. The pate maison arrives in a pair of thick chunky slices, a real rustic version sided generously with toasts and a heap of salad. If this were mainly a wine-drinking evening, this could be your whole dinner. Still hungry? Many of the apps come in two portion sizes, so nibbling an order of six snails, or hogging an order of 12, or sharing it with friends, provides plenty of noshing options.',\n",

Eat it with the country’s famous red rice ($1.99), nutty tasting and here mixed with basmati, or with tingmo ($1.50), a delightful steamed bread tied in a big knot like a weight lifter’s shoulder. Proving ema datsi’s primacy to Bhutanese cuisine, the restaurant offers several variations in which a single ingredient — potatoes, mushrooms, or green beans — has been added to the recipe. I like the one with potatoes, which feels more like a full meal than the others.',\n",

The bird is neither fried nor particularly spicy, but it is tasty and nourishing, consisting of little boneless pieces thinly coated with a sauce of tomatoes and onions. The recipe could be mistaken for Tuscan in the simplicity of its ingredients list. Other similar stews, called curries for lack of a better term, include dried beef and dried pork, which are good choices if you like chewy food.

(Please see the hokey warriors of Ninja and the bacchanalian Buddhas of Tao.) Theme restaurants, typically, are not very good places to eat. And so that brings us to the curious case of Santina in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, a hangout that hawks grilled fish, raw vegetables, one of the world's finest minestrone soups, and a Hollywood studio's worth of set design.

The preparation that fascinated me most of all was a 48-hour brisket; I’d heard Thomas Keller was doing cool things with sous-vide cookery, creating the possibility of magical medium-rare braises, imparting fascinating color and textural contrasts to cuts that should've come out uniformly brown. How did the meat taste? Couldn’t tell you. The $210, service-included price (before supplements), was too high for this young writer. So it wasn't until a few years later that I got my fix, not at Per Se but at David Chang’s $85 Momofuku Ko, where a high-tech water bath treatment left my short ribs gorgeously pink. There were no supplements at Ko. There was also no coddling. The setting was a cramped East Village counter. The first course was a pork rind.

The appetizer portion of the menu also offers a three-cheese fondue, meatballs in tomato sauce, and a daily soup, but go instead for chipirones a la plancha ($12), small squid in a dark and salty braise. Also worthwhile is the split and grilled chorizo, which might remind you of smoked Polish sausage.

The al dente strands are tossed with mushrooms and ham, mellowed by cream, and sharpened with onions, and the pasta manages to seem more South American than Italian.

But Portugal, a country of just 10 million, has seen just a handful of chefs rise to upper echelons of Manhattan dining in the 21st century. George Mendes, without question, is the most accomplished of them. And while his peers have built global empires in the past half-decade, Mendes has run just one restaurant, Aldea, since 2009. Now he finally has his sophomore venue. And it's awesome.\",\n",

If Spain, as a country, is often touted as the future of food, with its foams, spheres, airs, and other modernist techniques, Portugal is perhaps more famous for its creations of yesteryear, like its caldo verde, a collard green soup traditionally served at weddings, or its its bacalhau, a salt cod whose underlying technique allowed explorers to preserve fish caught off the coast of Newfoundland as early as the 15th century. Then there's Mendes, trained by the likes of Spain's Martín Berasategui and, for a two week stint, by Adria & Co. at El Bulli. He defied tradition when he opened Aldea, combining Portuguese sensibilities with his modernist techniques to create sardine napoleons and soups with alginate mushroom spheres.\",\n",

We now have our cheaper, albeit equally ambitious Lupulo.\",\n",

Pair it with a tart apple cider and there’s your $25 meal. Others will double up and order soft shrimp turnovers, essentially a high-end version of Totino's pizza rolls stuffed with creamy shellfish.

Oh, and just down the block is a check-cashing business.

       " [\"For the fine dining naysayers of Manhattan's gilded aughts, the pre-crash years that brought us $1,000 meals at Masa and Per Se, the 2005 debut of Danny Meyer's The Modern represented a welcome counterpoint. Located on the ground floor of MoMA in Midtown, The Modern was where one could enjoy a cocktail or a small plate for less than the twenty bucks it cost to visit the museum. Even if a longer tasting could run hundreds, there was something refreshing about an entry-level culinary experience being more accessible than an entry-level art experience – in the same building, no less. The Modern wasn't a captive audience institution designed to shake down gallery-goers with overpriced panini; it was an independent establishment, with no entry fee, designed to bring in guests who might not have visited a museum in the first place. And now, eleven years later, as the city's gastronomic and artistic centers of gravity have shifted downtown, Meyer has scored with another affordable museum eatery, this one in the Meatpacking District. Welcome to Untitled at the newly-relocated Whitney.\",\n",
       "  \"The folks to thank here are Michael Anthony, who also runs Meyer's Gramercy Tavern, and chef de cuisine Suzanne Cupps. Together, they're serving some of the city's most accomplished vegetable-forward fare at very reasonable prices. A snack for two – a glass of muscadet, a beer, a pickle plate (with stunning curried cauliflower ribs), and a lemony lobster toast – will cost less, after tax, but before tip, than two $22 tickets to the museum. Call it a boon for those who'd rather take in one of the city's newest pieces of celebrity architecture – Renzo Piano is the designer – while sitting down and eating, instead of while schlepping around the exhibits without booze.\",\n",

It's the kind of restaurant whose merits and quirks you'll be pressed to debate with your colleagues – just as you might after seeing Carroll Dunham's NSFW nude on the Whitney's fifth floor. So here are your talking points for Untitled, as well as for Meyer's more casual Studio Cafe on the 8th floor.\",\n",
       "  \"The Modern still ranks No.1 in the looks department; it's where diners relax in Arne Jacobsen chairs (which individually cost more than a MacBook Pro) while overlooking the museum's serene sculpture garden. But the Piano-designed Untitled, with its sloping ceilings and never-ending glass walls, is a close second. Guests sit in plush Eero Saarinen chairs (about $1,500 retail) while overlooking a down-the-block line of people waiting to get into the museum; it's as if Piano is saying that in the Meatpacking District, the well-heeled street denizens are the real sculptures worthy of observation. The room and the vistas, incidentally, are a heck of a lot prettier than the Whitney itself, which looks like a well-polished 1980s Xerox machine.\",\n",

And yet Anthony doesn't serve any of the above, not even at lunch. Instead, he sends out the type of edgy, small-to-mid-sized plates that one might encounter at a boundary-pushing restaurant in Brooklyn or the Lower East Side. He gives us chamomile-infused peas with favas, a whisper of summertime sugar, or matzoh-thin flatbread anointed with bacon and creamed corn, a heavier dose of vegetable-based sweetness. He takes beets with yogurt, a fairly run-of-the-mill pairing, and turns the ingredients into an epic cold borscht of sorts; the addition of pickled cherries, sweet cherries, currants and tarragon evoke a fragrant summer evening in the Russian taiga.\",\n",

Note to other beverage directors around the city: If you want to encourage novice oenophiles to drink more off-the-beaten track wines, this is how to do it. And here it\\'s worth mentioning that while good restaurants rarely sell more than a bottle or two of Champagne at $100 or less, Untitled, taking a cue from sister spot Marta, offers eleven in that range, including a lean, mean, 100 percent pinot meunier (Christophe Mignon) for $69.',\n",

Better are the cubes of swordfish over roasted eggplant; take away the delectably oily flesh and the dish would still boast a breathtaking degree of complexity, with a tomato saffron vinaigrette lending a floral counterpoint to the smoky nightshade. And the chicken – Anthony uses an insanely flavorful Green Circle breed – is the game-changing protein here; the breast is roasted on the rotisserie, imparting the skin with a funky, pliable softness, while the soy-and-garlic marinated thighs are fried, evoking a masterful, Japanese-style karaage.',\n",

The postprandial treats of Miro Uskokovic, unlike the innovative fare of chef Anthony, can feel as generic as a pair of khakis at Georgetown University. Cake, be it the peanut butter blueberry variety or chocolate fudge, wouldn't be out of place at any airport restaurant, anywhere in America. And poundcake with strawberries is no better than the supermarket version you could make at home. Panna cotta, bland and overgelatined, is rescued by a tart berry compote, while a coconut and apricot tart packs such a dense shell it flips on its side when you try to cut it. Even the chocolate chunk cookie, while technically brilliant (and delicious), feels out of place on such an ambitious menu.\",\n",
       "  \"The Studio Cafe, a separate restaurant on the 8th floor, requires a ticket to the Whitney, and therefore qualifies as more of a traditional captive audience venue – an institution that faces little competition because this is inevitably where museum guests will come to refuel without leaving the building. And yet Anthony's mostly-toast menu (cue eye rolling) is as awesome and affordable as anything one might encounter at a cool East Village establishment. Everything's an essay in balance. Cucumbers inject a dose of watery freshness into buttery avocado toast. Green tomato jam imparts acidity to rich cheddar toast. Spicy Thai pickles cut the sweet density of honeyed peanut butter toast. And summery tomatoes, in a more traditional preparation, take the edge off the tartness of goat cheese. They're all $12 each and you enjoy them on the elevated outdoor deck, with its stunning vistas of One World Trade, the Hudson, and The Empire State Building. It's the type of food, and the type of view, that'll alone justify the museum's $85 yearly membership. And it's all enough to make us wonder whether Meyer, the new king of captive audience dining, will find a way to make us want to have dinner at the local DMV or the nearest hospital in the coming years.\",\n",

The bill of fare reads like a Google Trend search of stereotypical New York dining: kale with \"healthy grains\" and bone marrow, wood-fired pizza, vegan ramen, fried chicken (packed with an intense poultry flavor), raw shellfish, large-format steaks, large-format uni (wut?), and tasting menus.

But next time you have $110 to drop on a starter, consider the 50 grams of sturgeon caviar, which is about what 30 grams of comparable roe often costs elsewhere. Or for $5 less than the price of the uni, consider the drunken fish, a silky study in the fragrant bitterness of Sichuan peppercorns without a ton of heat. By all means avoid the $69 and $99 tasting menus, which pummel the diner with 11-13 dishes, many of them served at once.',\n",

Damn, it’s good! Find ho mok among a wealth of other unusual fare at Kiin Thai, a new offshoot of Somtum Der in the midst of the N.Y.U. campus — how’s that for hiding in plain sight?

It creeps across the map to include Central Thai recipes as well as noodles from Chiang Mai, a city on Thailand’s border with Burma. An example of the latter is khao soi ($15), a meal-size soup in a rich yellow broth stippled with red chile oil, which also shows Burmese influences. Soft egg noodles lurk in the depths while crunchy fried noodles float on top — as if the cook couldn’t decide which type to use. Khao soi might just be the Siamese dish of the year, since it’s also showcased at Pok Pok and (unsurprisingly) at Kao Soy, both in Red Hook.',\n",

Grilled summer shrimp ($10) constitutes a cunning variation on Vietnamese summer rolls. Colorfully served in a series of four shot glasses, each roll features pickled carrots, cucumbers, and good-size shrimp tumbled inside an oak-lettuce leaf, which is further wrapped in sticky rice paper. A dose of fermented fish sauce finishes the accompanying tamarind dip, which is so good you’ll grab it back from the busboy as he tries to remove it from the table.',\n",

Thankfully, Kiin is one place you won’t be asked to select a level of hotness — the dishes come just the way they are and you’ll have to deal with it. Other menu oddities include duck in an oily red curry; the obscene-sounding golden bags (vegetables fried in rice paper); and chicken wrapped in pandanus leaves.

My favorite dish on the menu is relished both in Isan and across the muddy Mekong River in Laos.

Whiskey Cola, after all, requires no skill to construct; it tastes no worse when furtively made in a movie theater bathroom stall than when poured at a mahogany counter staffed by bearded men.

Now take a sip. Does the Whiskey Cola taste a bit more complex than usual? That's because Bennett adds a dose of Fernet-Vallet, a Mexican cordial whose medicinal overtones transform the entire concoction into a boozy cardamom-clove-quinine coke.

The venue has also upped its game with a serious, sherry-spiked beverage list and a $65, seven-course tasting, the first serving of which is that epic toon dish.\",\n",

In the 1970s and 1980s, white linen destinations like Shun Lee Palace and Mr. Chow showed that New Yorkers were willing to pay top dollar for fancy Chinese fare long before they were willing to do so for high-end Mexican. Thing is, the second coming of expensive North Asian eating would founder at the turn of the century. Toronto import Shang, which this critic derided for its $16 cole slaw, didn’t last long in the mid-aughts; neither did Wakiya, and Hakkasan, the exorbitant Cantonese behemoth, has few local supporters in the critical community despite its Michelin star.',\n",

       "  '2. The fortified wine selection is strong; it includes two lean Fino sherries (Valdospino and Mons Urium, $8) that pair well with the toon cloud or fried clams. Try the nuttier Amontillado (Lustau, $6) with richer dishes.',\n",
       "  '3. In addition to the $30 wine pairings for the tasting menu, Fung Tu can arrange for half-pours or pairings with the a la carte menu. Discuss your budget with a waiter.',\n",
       "  '4. No Champagnes by the glass (or bottle) on the current list. For something with bubbles, consider the Domaine de la Coche \"Emma,\" a sparkling gamay-grolleau blend from the Loire valley that tastes of strawberries and yogurt; pair it with the excellent raw mackerel.',\n",
       "  \"5. The ideal draft beer is the Reissdorf Kolsch, a light, bright, summery brew that will help quell the heat of Sichuan pork ragu with spaetzle. There's also a Rodenbach Grand Cru sour ale ($10) for those who like something more challenging and complex.\",\n",
       "  \"It wasn’t until last year's relaunch of Danny Bowien’s Mission Chinese Food that expensive Chinese fare started to perk up our ears again, only this time it would be tailored for our haute-casual, walk-ins-only era. Bowien's dressed-down, downtown hangout, tipping its hat more to a casual French brasserie than to a fine dining restaurant, immediately attracted throngs of fans willing to pay $100 for certain She-Ra-sized main courses and $69 - $99 for belly-stuffing tasting menus that emphasize salty, spicy, not-quite-primed-for-Instagram dishes.\",\n",
       "  \"Fung Tu, a reasonably quiet, 55-seat room, is definitely not MCF; the latter can feel like a hustling, bustling, caviar-studded, hip-hop record after party at times. And while Bowien takes a more ambitiously rustic approach to American Express-worthy Chinese-American fare, with dots of refinement here and there, Wu’s path to the gastronomic truth is often more elegant – though he's not afraid to get lowbrow when necessary.\",\n",
       "  \"The fourth course on Fung Tu's tasting menu is a Wrestlemania-esque pile-on of ramps, fiddlehead ferns, black garlic, mushrooms, and nettle puree. Flavors of pine, earth, and awesomeness explode as if they were spiked with MSG.\",\n",
       "  'Such elegance also comes into full force with the a la carte fava bean curd, a dish of such complexity it took Wu 518 words to describe its preparation and significance in an email. Allow me to present the simplified explanation: Wu blends the legume with kuzu starch and the end product tastes like what would happen if hummus were transformed into firm tofu (albeit with greener, more vegetal overtones). He then tops the cool terrine with a dice of bacon (for smoke) a scattering of cilantro (for aroma) and a modicum of chili oil (for restrained heat). Gorgeous.',\n",

       "  'If that \"vegetables-seasoned-with-meat\" dish is Stone Barns-worthy, The Fung Tu Way is also adaptable enough to honor the traditions of cardboard box takeout fare. This is why Wu douses crispy chicken wings in a housemade yellow sauce that evokes the sinus-clearing sting of Chinese mustard packets (the ones that seem to invade everyone\\'s office drawers post-delivery). He stuffs fatty pork belly into an egg roll but keeps the richness in check via something unexpected: the salty bitterness of olives. He takes a fluff-tacular bowl of brisket fried rice and finishes it with pomegranate seeds, adding a juicy, Sephardic counterpoint to the heady meat. And he pays homage to the classic softness of dan dan noodles with a German twist; he douses spaetzle in a bitter and fragrant Sichuan pork sauce. If the texture recalls Chef Boyardee a bit too much, just think of it as a spicy porridge and deal with it.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes, the Chinese associations are more freewheeling. Hence, a Mission Cantina-esque masa scallion pancake with smoked chicken (skip it), a fusion-y, five-spice seasoned Calabrian spreadable sausage (essentially a \"meat dip\" for shrimp chips), or excellent fried clam bellies dusted with tomato powder and black beans. \"I don\\'t cop to many things New England,\" says Wu, who grew up in Hartford, Connecticut. \"I despise the Red Sox and Patriots, but I do fully admit to a love for fried clams.\"',\n",
       "  'And then there are the Mexican-esque \"China-liques,\" wherein yucca chips chips and pork sauce sit atop a delicate egg custard. The preparation is craveworthy in the same way that lots of spicy, fatty dishes are craveworthy after six beers, but a more sober-minded gourmand will find that the ghost pepper used to fuel the ragu is overpowering. Such levels of pain are more appropriate for MCF, not for a venue like Fung Tu trying to do something more refined.',\n",
       "  'Wok-fried rice noodles, which practically scream with notes of toasted buckwheat, cool things down a bit. Wu adds kielbasa for extra oomph, making it all taste like a humble Eastern European take on Chinese fare. Wu justifies the pairing by talking about how Polish-Ukranian sausages are making their way into Northern China, but the better reasoning is that it just tastes good. And that indisputable deliciousness is why Fung Tu is yet another argument for expanding our notion of what Chinese food is and for convincing us to pay maybe just a little bit more for it.',\n",

But is it? Gaston Acurio, Peru's most famous chef, belly flopped here at his high-end La Mar Cebicheria, shutting it down after less than two years. But long before Acurio, New York City possessed a decent collection of small, inexpensive Peruvian cafes aimed at immigrants and rotisserie chicken joints targeting the general population, both mainly found in Queens. Now along comes Jora, a Long Island City gastropub with a concept poised between fancy restaurant and budget café. Is Bourdain right, and can Peruvian cuisine succeed in attracting an enthusiastic citywide clientele?\",\n",
       "  'Named after a strain of Andean corn used to make a fermented beverage called chicha, Jora is located just off Jackson Avenue near the Pulaski Bridge, which funnels traffic from Brooklyn to Queens. Think of the neighborhood as Greenpoint North. A friend and I stumbled on Jora after being told there was a two-hour wait at nearby Mu Ramen. We forged inside to discover a waiting area outfitted with plush couches and a pair of dining rooms sumptuously adorned with gilded Inca motifs. A line of Indian pottery lurked in niches up near the ceiling, making us feel like we were raiding a Pre-Columbian tomb. At the end of the dining rooms we found a rather luxurious bar. When was the last time you perched on a bar stool that had a back, let alone thick padding?',\n",

Fourteen in all, they included many of the things Bourdain had encountered as Peruvian street food. Anticuchos ($9) were a pair of ruby-red veal-heart brochettes — not minuscule morsels, but hefty chunks tender enough to remind you that, like steak, the heart is a muscle. Marinated in chile paste, the symbol of bovine love had a vinegary tang with a touch of cumin and came with enough sides to be mistaken for an entrée. Scattered around the plate were bulbous kernels of hominy, a couple of red spuds, and a heap of pickled purple onions.\",\n",
       "  \"The mixed-seafood ceviche ($15) was good, too: a pile of sea bass, shrimp, mussels, octopus, and squid laced with lime juice and little else. If you want to amplify the full-meal properties of this seafood collection, order jalea instead: the same assortment breaded, fried, and presented with planks of yuca, in what is probably Peru's most popular bar snack. Even before Jora appeared, you could see jalea being munched in taverns up and down Roosevelt Avenue.\",\n",
       "  \"The starter of octopus squirted with a curious lavender sauce, though, was dull enough to make us scream, which once again suggests the main problem of a gastropub like Jora: the owners don't trust the general public to like chili peppers as much as they do. This can be easily remedied with aji panca, a yellowish chile paste that is readily provided if you ask for it. At least one app doesn't need the hot sauce: rocoto relleno ($9), a portly red pepper stuffed with ground beef, raisins, and hardboiled eggs, a real peasant classic you could eat for breakfast every day.\",\n",

Unfortunately, the entrees also tend to be bland. Made with a massive lamb shank, seco de cordero ($19) might be a brown-gravied English casserole, while the national dish of aji de gallina —normally a fiery yellow stew with a thick sauce — is like cheesy library paste. The curry of shrimp and lima beans called chupe de camarones is even worse.

At Gan Eden on 47th Street, the luscious, grease-glistening brochettes were cooked next to an open window over a baking sheet filled with lump charcoal — making patrons fear asphyxiation. They came in droves anyway. Subsequent larger restaurants appeared in Rego Park, Queens, and Borough Park, Brooklyn, offering full menus from the cities of Bukhara, Samarkand, and Tashkent, where Silk Road influences informed a cuisine of noodle-bearing soups, meaty rice pilafs, circular breads indented in the middle, purse-shaped dumplings, and those charcoal-grilled kebabs we first fell in love with.\\n  \",\n",

With an area of nearly 15,000 square miles and population of less than a million, the country is mainly shrub-covered mountains, the largest of which, Gangkhar Puensum, is the highest unclimbed peak in the world. Many Bhutanese are shepherds, and they are represented on the menu by a series of three dishes called aima dhatse ($6), a fascinating stew tinted pink with tomatoes and thickened with white cheese.

Firm Chinese schrenckii caviar acts as a very expensive salt for a mound of toro tartare.

       " ['Last year one of my favorite restaurants was Bhojan, a Curry Hill newcomer that peddled vegetarian Guajarati cuisine from India\\'s wild wild west. It was an outpost of the empire of Indian dining impresario and B-list Bollywood actor Shiva Natarajan, whose other holdings in the city include Chola, Dhaba, Malai Marke, and Chote Nawab — oddly named after a 1961 movie nobody seems to like. But Natarajan has done more to popularize the regional cuisines of his native land than anyone before him, and has also been instrumental in remaking the restaurant scene on lower Lexington Avenue, nicknamed \"Curry Hill\" since the 1980s. The food at his establishments — at slightly elevated prices — is frequently excellent.',\n",
       "  'Which is why I was disappointed when Bhojan shuttered just as it was gaining traction, and Natarajan replaced it with Haldi, specializing in the food of Calcutta and Bengal. Sprinkled throughout the menu are a small collection of Jewish-Indian delicacies, real critic bait. I was there in a flash. The Indian-Jewish stuff proved OK, though lacking in nuance, but when I brought a Bengali friend to sample the food he\\'d grown up with, he wrinkled up his nose and exclaimed, \"The curries are well-prepared and wholesome, but the place has got the spicing scheme all wrong!\" And I had to agree: the food tasted way more Punjabi than Bengali, with a dearth of mustard oil and too many entrees awash in brown gravy.',\n",
       "  \"Accordingly I did what critics must sometimes do and abandoned the project just as I was about to pay my third visit. Instead, I took a chance and dragged myself and my friends to another Natarajan restaurant a few doors down, Kokum. We found an interior decorated with hanging basket lamps and a mural of the high-prowed and brightly painted fishing boats of Kerala, India's southernmost state. The dining room was deep and narrow, with rows of tables along both walls. A bar at the end of the room dispensed beer, wine, and cocktails. Skip the awful cocktails, but do hoist a Kingfisher Beer — Indian suds with a touch of sourness, now being brewed in Saratoga Springs, just north of Albany.\",\n",

Coconut, curry leaves, and black mustard seeds are dominant flavorings, while batters of ground-up rice and lentils are fermented to make pancakes and fritters.',\n",

Another dish featuring the same red fruit is Nadan fish curry ($18), name-checking a 2013 film set in Kerala featuring an old-fashioned dramatic troupe on the skids. You'll need an Indian-film expert to ferret out all the obscure cinematic references on a Shiva Natarajan menu — though this particular dish turns out to be a plainish collection of tilapia chunks in a tart red sauce that is somewhat disappointing.\",\n",

Egg roast ($8.95) is one of the most agreeable apps; boiled specimens halved and heaped with spicy onions, seeming like a worthwhile spin on deviled eggs. Eggs occur in stealthier fashion in egg dosa, a crepe featuring the usual potato filling. But when you cut into it you'll find an egg annealed to the inside of the pancake. In likewise fashion, eggs appear as the star of the show in a biryani; scrambled with tomatoes, chiles, and torn-up flatbread in egg kothu paratha (like some mutant bread pudding); and most spectacularly in egg appam, bowl-shaped breads, each with a runny fried egg at the bottom, sided with a vegetarian or non-vegetarian curry.\",\n",

Pumpkin tossed with blackeyed peas yields erissery ($12.95), which might be the name of a Roman poet. The beans add a smoky flavor to the squash's sweetness, and the dish is utterly delicious. In bisi bela Houliana, a recipe from Bangalore, rice is stewed with all sorts of vegetables, and made tart with tamarind pulp. The dish is usually named bis bela bath — who knows why Natarajan tacked an Irish-sounding name on the end?\",\n",

Finally, there were butter fried eggs coated in breadcrumbs and flanked by spicy stewed chickpeas.

Call it an unusually delicious menage a trois of fat. Such preparations can border on feeling like a Dean & Deluca raid, but it's all so awesome that Hamilton somehow manages to pull them off.

The ceremony was preceded by a brief dialogue on how the flavor of the brew would’ve been different had the Chinese product been harvested at a different altitude, and just in case there was any confusion, the gentleman overseeing the rituals handed me his business card, on which was printed a single, Portlandia-esque title: “Tea Curator.” You’ve got to be kidding me.\\n  ',\n",

No, not all culinary institutions age gracefully; just making it to a decade is a triumph. And so that's why I'm happy to report that 27 years after it opened, Hakan Swahn's Manhattan establishment still kicks ass, with a new chef, Emma Bengtsson, who turns out to be a serious gastronomic force to be reckoned with.

The diver scallop, one-dimensional and cloying elsewhere, exhibits a powerful brininess here, with a hint of sugar from the Maine urchin and a lick of acidity from a pungent vinaigrette.

And while brined cod with fried anchovy is straight up FlavorTown, the 4oz portion, on the same menu as the lamb, is another gut buster. That's up to ten ounces of protein in two consecutive courses. Not cool. But still. There are just enough jolts of culinary lightening in Bengtsson's cooking to warrant the attention of anyone who cares about fine dining in New York. The price is right too, with a five-course menu at $95, and an eight-course tasting at $135. Order the longer menu, as that's the only way to sample the epic sweetbread preparation.

The tart-sweet-crunchy combo is as good as ever, and so is Aquavit.

There, the food can be even spicier than that of Isaan.',\n",

Instead of being mixed with sweet coconut milk, the ground pork (or beef or chicken) is cooked in a curry paste with a small amount of water, along with lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves, until the meat turns damp but not soupy. The accompanying cucumbers and lettuce are used to scoop up bites, serving to partly staunch the burn. Though kua kling outwardly resembles an Isaan larb, the dish is much more variegated in its flavoring.',\n",

Maybe you\\'ll be surprised to hear there\\'s a version of Malaysian roti canai called roti panang nuea ($7) featuring the same flaky pancake.

And thanks to the citrus \"dust,\" it all has a fragrant finish that recalls a gourmet version of the coating on a Haribo Gummi Peach. On the side, there\\'s a bottle Tabasco-spiked honey that starts off spicy and ends with a wave of sugar. It\\'s not just good, it\\'s unmistakably unique.

And the price is right too — $18 for a half-order (feeds two), and $35 for a full one.\",\n",

Root & Bone, like Joaquin Baca's excellent Brooklyn Star, is an essential outlier in this regard, taking a local and seasonal approach to comfort food. And while it's far from perfect — the deviled eggs are as average as anywhere else  — Root and Bone's kick-ass classics give hope that New York can play a legit role in not just honoring the foods of the South but also in moving the culinary conversation forward.\",\n",

       "  'Indeed, there are few other savory chefs who deploy sugar with such aplomb as McInnis and Booth. They tone down the vegetal notes of mashed parsnip with a gentle maple sauce. They take a Kurobuta pork chop and inject a world of flavor into it with a heady peach-bourbon syrup. It almost veers into cloying territory until the sting of chili shocks the palate back into order, and a soft nugget or two of pork belly adds a musky uppercut.',\n",

Even worse are fried chicken and waffle sandwiches, two leaden gut bombs stuffed with overly-fatty thigh meat. And corn on the cob is doused in a one-note cornbread butter and stale popcorn.

The red wine tang and griddle-crisped beefiness result in a product that could easily compete with the (excellent) $42 version at Tom Colicchio's Craft. And as for the shrimp and grits — this is the version to compare all other versions to. The crustaceans pack that gentle maritime tang that let you know they come from good waters; the grits are bursting with robust corn flavor; and the country ham, shellfish jus, and Brooklyn lager sauce combine to produce such a funky, salted, umami-packed punch I was convinced the chefs slipped some fermented XO sauce in there (they did not).

It's one of the few New York hangouts that an out-of-town culinary novices could name with ease, which probably explains why it was once America's highest grossing independent eatery — a title it could very well claim again, as it currently feeds 900-1000 guests on weekdays, and up to 1,700 on weekends.\",\n",

In the late 1930s as the Spanish Civil War wound down, leftist refugees (paradoxically known as \"Republicans\") streamed into Greenwich Village, eager to tell their stories of Fascist persecution. Many started Spanish restaurants there and in surrounding neighborhoods. In addition to formal dining rooms, many of these places — including Rio Mar in MePa and El Quijote in the Chelsea Hotel — boasted dark, red-upholstered barrooms where the odor of garlic wafted through like an ocean breeze. While the dining rooms were busy peddling massive servings of paella to hungry, cash-strapped bohos, the bars served snacks to homesick Spaniards, including grilled sardines, flaming chorizos, and poached octopus washed down with wines, sherries, and sangria.\\n  ',\n",
       "  'Numbering perhaps two dozen, these combo restaurants and tapas bars dominated the city\\'s Iberian food scene for 60 years, until a startling event occurred. A decade ago Mario Batali launched Casa Mono (\"Monkey House\"), a newfangled type of tapas bar with no restaurant attached, serving regional Spanish small plates with Italian twists. The orange-clogged dude also took what had been a placid institution and added a new level of theatricality, allowing you to admire a cook flipping coxcombs on a broad griddle. And Casa Mono elevated the runny poached egg to a pinnacle it would never descend from.',\n",
       "  'Not long after Boqueria debuted, named after a Barcelona market. If Casa Mono was a carefully constructed one-act play, Boqueria was a three-ring circus. The minute you came in the door, there was a gal madly slicing things in the front window, and the entire place — which featured raised tables and felt like an airline departure lounge — was constantly abuzz. But though small plates of charcuterie, bread dips, and pan con tomate attracted the most attention, these places and the imitators that soon followed insisted on backsliding on the promise of a real tapas bar by offering full-blown entrees that competed with the small plates.',\n",
       "  \"These two establishments begat the modern New York tapas bar, where you were invited not only to graze but to sit down and eat a full meal. But with international attention currently swinging from Catalonia's Ferran Adria to the Basque country's Andoni Luis Aduriz, it was inevitable that some new restaurant would want to chuck the sit-down menu and take these institutions back to their roots in the famous pintxo bars of San Sebastian. That place is Donostia.\",\n",
       "  \"Located at the northeast corner of Tompkins Square Park, Donostia is the Basque-language name of the city and tourist mecca of San Sebastian. In case you didn't get the message, an antique map of the Basque territory is repeated three times on the wall. The bar is gray-splotched white marble. The lighting consists of tortured metal globes like an eagle's talon in the deep narrow barroom, and a nifty chandelier made of wine glasses in a semi-private room toward the back. A third room allows tapas eaters to survey the bare-bones food prep area. With the facade flung open in fine weather, the place takes full advantage of the park, and there's nothing quite like sitting at one of the raised tables in front drinking a glass of sweet sherry and nibbling a pintxo or two as the sun sinks behind the Temperance Arch.\",\n",
       "  \"The function of a real tapas bar? It's a place to have a drink or two in the evening and a handful of snacks selected for their sharp flavor and eye-appeal. The food represents a hunger-deterrer, not a meal. The same implied advice pertains to Donostia: Have a drink or two, but don't try to eat dinner, because if you do, you'll be disappointed. But as a place to snack and explore the alcoholic beverages of Spain, Donostia is unparalleled. The food menu sprawls across two folio pages in a whopping 17 categories, but is reducible to a small collection of dried, pickled, and canned ingredients repeated in several small-plate formats. Don't expect any of the current dining tropes of fresh, local, or sustainable to be observed. This contrariness alone makes Donostia worth visiting.\",\n",

These banderillas look like miniature chivalric pennants carried into a battle of flavors. The montaditos are similarly compelling, edible bread-mounted sculptures on which you might find a dab of salt-cod puree, a tentacle of octopus, brine-pickled cherry tomatoes, blue-veined cabrales cheese, a baton of eerily white asparagus, or the best canned sardine you\\'ve ever tasted.',\n",

You also can't go wrong with the charcuterie assortment called plato de carne y queso ($20). A friend who's spent time in San Sebastian noted that the tapas bars there whet your hunger with trays displaying snacks stacked on every available surface. While our own health department prohibits this sort of sumptuous display, the bar at Donostia features several selections on cake-display platters under glass.

Not long after Donostia opened, an olive\\'s throw away on First Avenue a place called Huertas (\"Orchards\") appeared, also claiming to be a Basque tapas bar. The interior makes artful use of dark woods and antique mirrors using bare brick as a backdrop. Huertas attracted lots of attention by its method of addressing the visual display problem by creating something called \"passed tapas,\" whereby pintxos would be placed on trays and carried through the barroom ($2 to $4). These were available in addition to medium-size dishes called raciones, which could be ordered from the kitchen.',\n",

The only dud here was the spongy hake croquette resting in a puddle of indifferent garlic mayo. There tend to be eight passed tapas listed on the chalkboards, and an additional 10 raciones, plus charcuterie and cheese, making the menu in the front room much easier to digest than Donostia's. As an added boon, some of the sea creatures featured are fresh and imported from Spain. Foremost in strangeness are percebes, gooseneck barnacles that look like a baby alien that has just gnawed its way through your stomach. The flesh squeezed from its neck is sweet, but the price of four or five small specimens priced at $13 is too steep. The best dish among the raciones is something called migas, featuring tidbits of duck and croutons tossed in a verdant green sauce, with fresh pea shoots on top.  Brilliant! Fresh is not a dirty word at Huertas, as it is at Donostia.\",\n",

       "  \"The list of Spanish alcohol is much shorter at Huertas; nevertheless, there is good cider, sherry, and vermouth (the latter on tap), and the barman is well versed in the selections available. Then there's the back room, which is reserved for a single prix-fixe meal ($52) in the faddish modern style, which flies in the face of the tapas tradition, though it serves as a reminder you're in the East Village rather than San Sebastian — as if you'd forgotten.\",\n",

The second course is a variation on the duck and pea-shoot migas of the raciones menu. So far, the meal has been a triumph, but it threatens to run off the rails with the third and largest course, which is not quite big enough to qualify as an entrée. This is the first course offering a selection of three, and my dining companion and I enjoyed a sliced duck breast with greens and golden raisins in a broth that threatened to be sweet, but wasn't. Less satisfactory was a grease-sodden vegetarian rice dish featuring pickled mushrooms squiggled with mayo, presented in a miniature paellera, suggesting once again that tapas bars shouldn't meddle in main dishes. The final course was a return to fine form, with three choices, from which we picked a pair of small cakes draped with pickled rhubarb and a cheese plate offering three bang-up selections with membrillo and a dab of honey.\",\n",

The doors unlocked at 5:30 p.m. and shortly after 6 p.m. I was told there would be no more Ivan-brand ramen left because half the city, apparently plagued by a mid-summer flu pandemic, thought it would be smart to order hot soup on a 91 degree day.

Case in point: Orkin lets diners wrap sheets of nori around morsels of slow cooked pork, roasted tomato, and sushi rice. Believe me when I say that if the $450 per person Masa ever wanted to drum up more business it could do so by putting these umami grenades on the menu. They cost $6 for two.\",\n",
       "  'But before we get too involved with all this deliciousness, it\\'s worth dwelling on the awesomely short queue a bit longer because really, waiting two hours for ramen makes about as much sense as booking a spot at your local slice joint a month out. Ramen, however underpriced it might be — a $15 entree whose complex components require a heck of a lot more effort to make than a $59 steak —  is still spur-of-the-moment \"I\\'m hungry\" food. And given the vast quantities of salt and fat you\\'re ingesting, sometimes a three-hour tasting menu\\'s worth of calories in a single bowl, perhaps it\\'s best not to think too much about it at all.',\n",
       "  \"Though it can be hard not to. Take Orkin's outstanding spicy ramen, a mix of dashi, chiles, and chicken broth, all studded with bits of pork and toothsome rye noodles. It sounds simple and the texture is rustic but it has the depth of flavor you'd expect from a fancy French sauce that some guy spent half his life learning to make. And then there's the heat, which lights your GI tract ablaze like a Roman candle going off in both directions. I dare you to eat it on a first date.\",\n",
       "  \"Or consider the triple-garlic mazemen, a style of whole wheat ramen where the ratio of broth-to-noodle is closer to Italian pasta than a can of Campbell's. Orkin roasts and distills his garlic to such a level of sweetness that Mark Ladner could sell this perfectly al dente dish at Del Posto for twice as much and no one would blink an eye. But since the world deems this delicious product to be cheap, Orkin charges just $15.\",\n",
       "  'No, none of this is terribly revolutionary, not here at least. While Orkin rose to fame in Tokyo by breaking the rules, he\\'s now competing in a city that excels in just that, where great traditional noodles co-exist with very good Americanized ramen. There\\'s Dassara in Brooklyn, which spins a gnarly \"deli ramen\" out of what\\'s essentially matzoh ball soup. There\\'s Ippudo in the East Village, which produces a tonkotsu so milky I\\'m certain each bowl results from putting an entire wild boar\\'s worth of fat through a commercial juice press. There\\'s Benkei on Delancey, where the chef won\\'t let you order his fine seafood ramen (or anything else) until well after midnight. And of course there\\'s Momofuku Noodle Bar, where David Chang sells a vegetarian chickpea creation that might just be the single most revolutionary ramen dish in New York right now.',\n",
       "  'So what makes Ivan Ramen vital in this competitive environment for starch and soup? Its ability to bridge the gap between the new and the old and deliver on both sides of that coin with solid service.

There's also an outdoor garden and it can fill up quickly — New Yorkers won't be denied their al fresco eats even if it means sweating into their soup.\",\n",
       "  'The ramen takes time to come out (as it should) so start with something cold and sour. Chinese broccoli with sweet soy pickled garlic will get the job done just fine, as will XO pickled daikon, with spaghetti-like strands of the radish coated in scallop chile oil and bits of dried shrimp. The flavor profile is fresh but it should also be salty and funky, which it is not, and that brings us to one of the quirks of Ivan Ramen: Orkin has an occasional tendency to dial down strong flavors.',\n",
       "  \"Thousand-year-old eggs, a Chinese dish where eggs are preserved in ash and lime for months, are traditionally valued for their pungent, sulphuric aromas. Here at Ivan, the delicacies are deviled and taste as neutral as that suburban American staple. Fried chicken livers and hearts are a fine study in crispy, snappy textures, but the meat is bland; there's no irony punch here. The milder approach works better for scrapple, a Pennsylvania Dutch breakfast meatloaf known for its restrained organ-meat overtones. Orkin nails that flavor profile dead-on, pressing pork shoulder, chicken liver, and buckwheat into a savory, offaly waffle, with bits of apple and maple mayo keep the richness in check.\",\n",
       "  \"Things get more turbo-charged with the ox tongue, whose assertive, rated-R beefiness needs the accompanying hot mustard and soft broth to keep things PG-13. Fried shrimp, often an ode in taste and texture to Amazon.com's packing materials, is 100 percent maritime bliss at Ivan Ramen, with the squirty heads still attached for sucking, and shrimp powder added on for oompf. And kudos to Orkin for amping up the oceanic aromas to 11 with his ankimo dirty rice, a gorgeous platform for the gentle sting of scallion and the high-tide tang of warm monkfish liver. It's a brilliant study in surf and earth.\",\n",
       "  'Now it\\'s time for the noodles. One of my well-fed dining companions, a musician who refers to himself as a \"ramen whore\" perhaps said it best: \"The shio and shoyu are classic and can be taken down in a heartbeat.\" I pass along that comment because you might see certain ramen experts with no concern for their blood pressure slurping down two bowls at once in 10 minutes flat (to enjoy the broth at its hottest and to avoid overcooking the noodles) — I\\'m more of a half-a-bowl in 20 minutes type of guy. If anything, I\\'ll argue the shio tastes better when cooler, as it allows the bonito it\\'s made with to shine through more clearly.',\n",
       "  \"Shoyu, in the earlier days, had the color of molasses and all the daydream-inducing complexity of the soy sauce it was made with. But Orkin now uses a lighter product with a shallower flavor. It's not bad, just not as good. Triple garlic, shio, and spicy chile ramen are the smartest moves here, while the four cheese mazemen is a fine Japanese carbonara of sorts, with nutty asiago and rich pork.\",\n",

There\\'s no dessert here — Orkin says he\\'s still \"tossing around\" that idea — and the lack of sweets of course helps him turn over tables more quickly. In the meantime, a friendly waiter recommends you saunter over to il Laboratorio del Gelato, where the wait, incidentally, might be longer than at Ivan Ramen; I suppose that makes a certain amount of sense in June to normal people, if not to food people.',\n",

And that brings us to the case of Nakazawa, an excellent sushi spot that might have fallen on the wrong side of that equation, at least on a recent visit when I was running behind. \",\n",
       "  \"Custom dictates that guests arrive at any given restaurant within 15 minutes of a reservation; yet within those first 15 minutes, Nakazawa staffers (and the chef) asked my dining companion about my whereabouts three times. Only after a second location-based query was she offered what most level-headed waiters offer guests when they arrive: a beverage that isn't water. I apologize for my tardiness — due to a duo of broken Citi Bike docks — but really, a restaurant's job is to make a guest feel comfortable — never the opposite.\",\n",
       "  \"Some might say I'm nitpicking. I'll counter that when you're spending $500 for two and vying for a reservation a month in advance, you want to feel coddled, not stigmatized, and the more you spend, the more such flaws are magnified. And for what it's worth, I arrived at Nakazawa 16 minutes past the reservation time. Yes, these ignominies were forgotten after we reckoned with raw scallops, as sweet and ethereal as French Îles flottantes. The mollusks were spiked with an aromatic yuzu-chili paste and served over a mound of rice so light it seemed not to exist. Perfect. \",\n",
       "  \"Then we experienced sake service that ranged from excellent to craptacular. So that's the bad news: Hospitality problems can persist throughout a meal at Nakazawa. The good news is there are few flaws in the fish. Nakazawa is already one of New York's better and more fairly priced sushi spots — no small achievement for a venue that's less than a year old. \",\n",
       "  'You probably know the story. Alessandro Borgognone, the co-owner, is a 33-year-old Staten Islander who used to cook at Patricia\\'s, his family\\'s restaurant in the Bronx. He discovered the 36 year-old Daisuke Nakazawa while watching him in \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi,\" a documentary detailing the painstaking work that goes on behind the scenes at three Michelin-starred Sukiyabashi Jiro in Tokyo. Borgognone lured the chef from a posting in Seattle and in August the duo opened Nakazawa in Manhattan\\'s West Village. ',\n",
       "  \"It instantly became one of New York's most difficult reservations. \",\n",
       "  \"Like at Jiro, Nakazawa serves a single product: Sushi. But unlike Jiro, where dinner is ¥30,000 (~$293 USD), things are a heck of a lot cheaper in New York. The price is $120 if you're dining  at one of Nakazawa's 25 dining room seats, with 21 pieces of nigiri served in flights. Those who sit at the gorgeous marble bar will pay $150 for the same meal, with most of the nigiri served one at a time. \",\n",
       "  'What accounts for the $30 price difference? \"We\\'re definitely pricing on demand,\" Borgognone tells me. He correctly asserts that guests (myself included) are willing to pay a premium for the theater of watching Daisuke rip the head off a live spot prawn. \"Sayonara time,\" the chef quips, before personally serving you the glistening crustacean. You pick up it with your hands and eat it; be sure to savor the jelly-like texture as it slide down your throat; this is a maritime gummy worm. Lovely. ',\n",
       "  'Then a waiter tries to pour tap into your sparkling water. Not so lovely. ',\n",
       "  \"Of course, sitting at the bar is more than just theater. Sushi is best consumed seconds after it's prepared, with the barely cool (or room temperature) fish being gently heated by the warm, vinegared rice. Borgognone rightly (and politely) admonishes diners who snap iPhone pics of the prepared sushi; there's no photography ban here, he just wants you enjoy the golden eye snapper right after it's blowtorched, with the fishy oils still oozing out like a pat of melting butter on toast. \",\n",
       "  \"Timing is all the more important with Daisuke's toro hand rolls; eat them instantly and the nori collapses with less resistance than a good soufflé. And while the nori wrapped around sea urchin wasn't as crisp as it should have been, you don't mind the oversight much because the Santa Barbara uni had such a crystal clear musk of the sea I'm halfway convinced Daisuke has figured out how to dry-age the orange roe like steaks. \",\n",
       "  \"What makes Nakazawa a satisfyingly uniform experience is that the head chef personally serves everyone at the bar — a pleasure that's less common at, say, Ushiwakamaru, where a ninth string sushi chef making spider rolls for the dining room was charged with preparing my $150 omakase a few years back. And at a recent meal at Tanoshi, which didn't cost too much less than Nakazawa, the backup chef started serving me mid-meal using a separate, somewhat mushier stash of rice. That won't happen here. \",\n",
       "  \"There are also no choices at Nakazawa, and that's something to keep in mind. One of the great things about Manhattan's best sushi restaurants is that dinner is often a dialogue, an interaction between the chef, who asks for preferences, and the guest, who lets the kitchen do most of the driving while putting in a few humble requests. At Nakazawa, the meal is monologue. You sit down and the food starts coming, perhaps a slice of banded grouper or sea bream with kumquat zest.\",\n",
       "  \"This isn't necessarily a bad thing; I've long been a proponent of no-choice menus at Alinea or Atelier Crenn. The question you have to ask yourself, however, is whether you view Daisuke's take on sushi, which emphasizes the more neutral and subtle flavors of the sea, to be a compelling enough narrative to warrant such restrictions. I'd argue it's more exciting to develop a relationship with a good chef like Masato Shimizu of the Michelin-starred 15 East, who can push you outside of your comfort zone while indulging your preference for say, oily and more strongly-flavored silver fish. In other words, Nakazawa isn't necessarily a great choice for regulars looking for a more bespoke experience.\",\n",
       "  \"What also isn't great: When you pick up your first piece of sushi (cherry salmon, served too cold), you discover there's no finger cloth to wipe the remaining rice off your hands — a waiter corrects the oversight a minute or so later after you look around in confusion.\",\n",
       "  \"Sake sommeliers sometimes do their jobs; they explain that you're drinking a Junmai Kimoto with nice acid; it matches well with richer fish like the clean horse mackerel or the umami-rich saba. Sometimes the sommeliers don't do their jobs; they pour your pairing, utter an unfamiliar name and and walk away before you can even make eye contact or discuss whether it's to your liking. And for those who'd like to peruse the wine or sake offerings in advance, sorry, there's also no online list. \",\n",
       "  \"Borgognone mentioned during a phone interview that diners are free to order more food after the end of the set menu; that courtesy, common at other omakase sushi spots, was never extended to me during my visits at Nakazawa — perhaps it's incumbent upon the diners to ask for a second round, which can be a tough proposition when all of a sudden Daisuke drops your dessert sushi and takes a bow. \",\n",
       "  \"It's not what you'd expect from a four-star restaurant, which Nakazawa most definitely is not. Everyone is pleasant enough and and the food is great, but just as punctuality is slightly more complicated than showing up on time, hospitality is more than being nice. It's about the steps of service and getting them right. It's a skill. And here, that skill needs honing.\",\n",

The restaurant, named after the Ivory Coast\\'s largest city, glows late into the evening, a welcoming presence on a darkened block near the Kosciusko Street station. A grid in the window displays the entire menu in 22 color photos, including several stews (called \"sauces\") paired with polished rice, boiled yams, or foutou; a pair of whole-fish platters; plus fried and jerked chicken, which are intended mainly as a come-on to non-West-African patrons.\\n  ',\n",

A large TV at the front of the house alternates mournful international news with Ivory Coast hip-hoppers wearing animal-print dashikis, backed up by gangs of undulant female dancers not quite in step. The proprietor will come around the counter to greet you, brandishing menus like the one in the window, only smaller and protected by plastic.',\n",
       "  \"Fully enjoying the city's West African eateries takes some practice. You must throw away many of the assumptions you usually bring to a restaurant meal. At Abidjan, after examining the menu, one must begin by asking the jolly, gray-haired proprietor what dishes are actually available that day. Chances are it will be only four or five. In many West African restaurants, the menu is considered a speculative document, generally listing every dish the cook can think of, even ones she has no intention of making. At least the menu gives you a good idea of what constitutes everyday fare for the average Ivory Coast citizen. Without as much meat, of course.\",\n",
       "  \"Your implied social contract with this type of restaurant guarantees you'll be fed a delicious, abundant, inexpensive, and perfectly prepared meal — not that you'll be able to fully exercise your dietary preferences. In this regard, Restaurant Abidjan resembles the earliest European restaurants, medieval lodgings where the innkeeper felt obliged to feed weary travelers, but only offered a single meal assembled at his whim. Yes, Abidjan will feed you well, but you can never be sure what.\",\n",

There no sides or apps, either, though a plate of sweet fried plantains ($6), enough for three to share, can function in a pinch as a starter, side dish, or even dessert. Also don't expect much in the way of beverages, though a pint of ginger or sorrel punch ($3.50) made with pineapple juice is often available. Leaving a burning sensation on the lips, the ginger is especially recommended. But the restaurant devotes so little attention to stocking beverages, your best bet is Mexican or Japanese beer from the Palestinian bodega a block east. Hooray for BYOB!\",\n",
       "  \"So what should you expect to eat at Restaurant Abidjan? If you're lucky, the peanut sauce ($7) will be available. It's like a liquid peanut butter sandwich, though one that has meat bobbing in it – either lamb, oxtail, or chicken, depending on the mood of the cook. Order foutou to go with it. This is a mash made of plantain flour, notable for its bouncy texture and plainish flavor. Nip off a piece with your thumb and forefinger and dip it deeply in the sauce, then close your eyes and chew. There are other mashes, too, including placali, an oblong wad of fermented yuca with a sour taste, said to satisfy hunger longer than milder mashes. Other alternatives include a plain plate of polished white rice, and something called tomato rice ($5), which is a moist morass of grain soaked in red sauce with some mixed vegetables thrown in, tasting like something you might find in a Spanish or Mexican restaurant.\",\n",
       "  \"Sporadically available are okra, palm-oil, eggplant, and chicken sauces ($7 each). The okra provides a lesson in mucoidal viscosity, and every friend I've taken to taste it has fallen immediately in love. If nothing else, the sauce demonstrates a familial connection between Louisiana Creole and West African cuisines. The palm oil sauce is reminiscent of the kind of canned meat gravy you might ladle over your instant mashed potatoes in Mid-America.\",\n",
       "  'The dish presentation is refreshingly rudimentary. Grilled lamb ($7) is three good-size chops accompanied by nothing but a pool of the same tomato relish we\\'ve seen before. Paleo dieters take note. Something you shouldn\\'t miss once you\\'ve tried the peanut and okra sauces is the national dish: a fried whole snapper, head on, accompanied by attieke (pronounced \"ah-check-ay\"), a tart stodge of fermented manioc meal that looks like white couscous. As with the sauces and mashes, you must buy the components of the meal separately ($12 and $3, respectively). To fully enjoy the attieke — which can be a bit dry on its own — mix the tomato relish and chopped French salad that comes with the fish into the starch before consuming it.',\n",

We learned, for example, that Gujaratis relish cornbread, yams, black-eyed peas, and greens just like American Southerners; but they also consume more exotic vegetables such as tindora – a pinky size cucumber – and ridged gourds called tori. Like many of the new Gujarati immigrants, the restaurant Chowpatty was vegetarian, and it catered to a religious group known as the Jains, whose concern for living things was so complete, they eschewed garlic and onions so as not to harm the insects that infested the underground bulbs of those plants.\",\n",

This South American republic is one of three places said to have invented ceviche (the other two are Mexico and Peru), and in its highlands, coastal lowlands, and interior jungles, ceviches appear as giant collections of seafood swimming in vast pools of citrus. Ecuadorian menus in New York often translate the term as \"cold soups.\"\\n  ',\n",

       "  'Of six varieties offered, most luxurious is ceviche mixto con concha negra (mixed ceviche with black clam, $18). The principal components are perfectly cleaned and deveined shrimp, chunks of corvina (a white-fleshed fish wildly popular in South America), octopus tenderized to within an inch of its young life, and concha negra, or black clam. Known to marine biologists by the alarming name of Anadara tuberculosa, this shellfish is traditionally found among the mangrove swamps around coastal Guayaquil, and reputed to be a powerful aphrodisiac.

As if that quantity of food were not enough, ceviches come with a side of polished white rice or crunchy corn nuts, which may be dumped into the soup to vary the aquatic terrain. Who could go back to tiny swatches of seafood napped in a teaspoonful of fruit juice after tasting this?\",\n",

A dozen chandelier fans spin madly at all times, and a few Christmas ornaments calculated to put you in a party mood hang from the ceiling on long strings. The front room flaunts an actual lunch counter which functions as a juice bar, and a red neon lobster burns in the front window – even though there's no lobster anywhere on the menu. Other than neglecting the roast guinea pig known as cuy, every other classic Ecuadorian dish is found on the bill of fare.\",\n",

Accompaniments include slices of ripe avocado; the fried, smashed, and fried-again woody plantains sometimes called tostones; and an undressed green salad that unfortunately contains discouraging quantities of fusilli. Still, the platter is a rollicking good deal, enough for two to share.\",\n",

King of the big feeds is the bandeja paisa ($13), which translates to something like \"national tray.\" It features a large chorizo split longitudinally and grilled, and a mass of top-round steak, sliced wafer-thin. This multiplies the caramelized surface area of the well-done meat. In a country where the cattle are muscular from climbing up and down the mountains and expensive, too, the thin-slicing is economical and makes for a tenderer chew.',\n",

On the weekends, an expanded roster of soups include the frankly weird caldo de bola – a vegetable soup sporting a brown globe in the middle. Inside the dumpling is a combo of ground meat and boiled egg, which spills out into the soup the minute you cut into it.

His blue cheese-topped strip steak, boasting gorgeous char on four sides, is slathered in a honey-spiked red wine sauce that would be better suited for pancakes.

From a raised platform a manager surveys the room, monitoring the comings and goings of employees dashing around the room like cowpokes, setting up and breaking down barbecues, distributing bottles of beer and platters of raw meat, busing tables, and forestalling groups of diners waiting hungrily in a knot just inside the door.\",\n",

Two reasons: the place cooks its meat over lump charcoal, imbuing it with smoky savor. And rather than serving flesh in small, unsatisfying portions, as they do it in Manhattan, Mapo delivers saddlebag-size hanks deeply veined with fat, which renders and sizzles as it hits the grill. Here's how a meal goes down.\",\n",
       "  \"Though Mapo is a full service restaurant, there's no doubt barbecue is its raison d'être. Unlike the 32nd Street barbecues, which offer perhaps a score of grillable choices, Mapo provides only four, and selecting which to get is the most important decision. Top of the line is marinated kalbi, which is fatty beef rib stripped from the bone and soaked in a solution of soy and Asian pear, tenderizing the beef and imparting a slightly sweet and salty taste. For Texans and other barbecue purists, there's an unmarinated version available.\",\n",
       "  \"Pork belly is a compulsory offering for any Korean barbecue joint, thick slices of unsmoked bacon that's mainly fat. Tragically, this cut cannot be cooked directly over the charcoal because it would burst into flame like an improvised explosive device and send diners scurrying from the restaurant. Accordingly, the belly is seared on a domed contraption placed over the grill that prevents it from absorbing much smoke. It's great anyway. The fourth and last choice is also piggy: fat-rimmed ribs that look like boneless pork chops, which cook up nice and smoky directly over the flame.\",\n",
       "  'Portions of kalbi are priced at $34.95, with the pork belly and pork ribs a few dollars less. The tables are set up for four or more diners (never go alone to a place like this), and one can easily order one less portion than the number of diners. It still sounds expensive, right? Wrong! With every allotment of barbecue comes a panoply of accompanying dishes, plus unlimited rice.',\n",
       "  'Banchan, kimchi',\n",
       "  \"First to hit the table like a flock of birds settling on a field of grain are the banchan – small dishes served in bowls and on saucers. Those accustomed to eating in Korean restaurants offering four or five of these in a predictable vein will be astonished by Mapo's banchan. On a more recent visit in early spring, three friends and I received 13. Besides the obvious cabbage kimchee, shredded daikon pickle, and cucumber salad, we got sweetened shavings of dried squid, boiled eggs, and chiles in soy sauce, sweet potato noodles with slivers of vegetable, mushroom stems in a tart salty dressing, sweet thick swatches of tofu skin, and ripply cubes of something amusingly called devil's tongue jelly, dressed with scallions and sesame oil.\",\n",
       "  \"Each dish was like a little adventure, though my fellow diners that evening didn't admire the potato puree that constituted a weak stab at American potato salad. These banchan serve a triple function throughout the meal: as appetizers, as side dishes, and as condiments with the grilled meat. By the way, when you run out of any of them – the long-aged cabbage kimchee is invariably gone by the middle of your repast – you should ask the waitress for more, and she readily complies.\",\n",
       "  \"You can almost hear a drum roll as the barbecue accoutrements arrive – a guy dashes up to the table and stops abruptly, holding with tongs a blackened metal vessel glowing with lump charcoal. Everyone pulls back apprehensively as he thrusts the smudge pot into a depression in the middle of the table, shooting up sparks into the overhead hood. Another employee installs a stainless steel grill over the live charcoal. Next the waitress appears with your meat. She ostentatiously displays the well-marbled meat, then shows us the bones it was cut from, picked clean, to demonstrate we weren't being cheated. We hadn't mistrusted her for a moment.\",\n",

Order one and they'll do it for you in the kitchen and deliver it already grilled. This could actually be good in summer if you don't want to sit on top of glowing coals. Even when you barbecue at the table, the waitress does most of the work, flopping the meat, snipping it with scissors into smaller chunks, then mounting the grill on an elevated rack and pushing the meat to the sides when it's perfectly done. At this point you serve yourself from the grill using chopsticks, or push the meat to the center if you want it done further or blackened to crispness. My advice: don't. The meat is tenderest when rare, and further grilling, while adding smokiness, can make the meat tough.\",\n",

Indeed, some kimchee or one of the other banchan can be also included in the lettuce packet. If you get pork belly, you should dip it in a condiment of sesame oil, salt, and pepper that is provided before wrapping it in lettuce.

The key at Cantina is that the burritos come sans rice. That means the interior is more of a soft stew of nourishing deliciousness than a starchy brick. Some bites burst of beans and soft, pulled pork. Other bites pop with cilantro, avocado, onions, and scallions. It is a fine seven-layer dip rolled up into a soft flour tortilla, and after tax and tip it'll cost you over $18. It packs enough food to qualify as a large format dish, so eat half now and save the rest for later if you want to walk away from this one with no serious injuries.\",\n",
       "  'Bowien, who walks and talks with the ease of a West Coast surfer, deserves props for mining the depths of American fast food to inform (some of) his fare. \"I grew up in Oklahoma and ate a lot of Taco Bell growing up,\" Bowien told me during a phone interview, adding that the Tex-Mex chain was his \"first exposure to real Mexican food.\" My response: \"same here.\"',\n",
       "  'In fact I\\'ll go even further. Taco Bell was a vital part my coming of age as a teenager; I once held my own in the drive-through lane on a mountain bike, with a menacing SUV behind me. It was a proud day for me and a quiet victory for cyclists craving FourthMeal. So my heart swelled when I learned Cantina was riffing on Taco Bell\\'s famous double decker — a recent addition. \"I didn\\'t want to come out of the gate with a pseudo-trashy dish,\" Bowien said.',\n",
       "  '',\n",
       "  'Double decker alambres',\n",
       "  \"He covers a soft flour tortilla with a layer of refried beans, tops that with a corn tortilla, throws in some grilled skirt steak, jowl bacon, tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, hot sauce and a crisped layer of cheddar. Sounds good, right? Problem is, it lacks the textural brilliance and structural integrity of the fast food original. If Taco Bell's version is a tender meat and bean mille-feuille, imparting legumes, crunch, and 88 percent ground beef with every bite, Mission Cantina's double decker requires fork and knife action before picking it up. And then you find yourself taking bits of grisly steak out of your mouth and give up. Cost: $8.50.\",\n",
       "  'Chicken wings',\n",
       "  \"Snack on spicy cucumbers instead ($6), drenched in a cooling cashew cream. Follow up with fried chicken wings ($12.50), slathered in a gently fiery mole whose chocolatey, nutty richness goes on and on. Finish off with a $40 fried rabbit that's salty, crispy, chewy and paired with a house-made hot sauce that ranks with Frank's for its addictive, vinegary punch.\",\n",
       "  \"This is strongly flavored fare that calls for the zing of margaritas. Too bad a myopic, Prohibition-era community board rejected Cantina's proposal for a full liquor license, an occurrence that's so common in contemporary New York I often joke that if Jesus Christ himself descended from the heavens and turned water into wine, his Big Apple neighbors would brand him a bootlegger.\",\n",
       "  \"This strongly flavored fare calls for the zing of margaritas. Too bad they're made with sochu.\",\n",
       "  'So for now, there are sochu margaritas, which taste like sweetened water flavored with lime cordial. No thanks. Just as bad is the wine service, with lousy reds served as warm as some of the food, and with most selections poured into clunky tumblers filled to the brim. So forget about swirling your $13 Loire Valley sauvignon blanc.',\n",
       "  \"Sake or beer will get the job done for now — Chili Devil brew comes with a pepper in the bottle and a fun kick of vinegar, while Southern Tier's Live pale ale packs the hops to deal with fattier menu items like the $35 Peking-style pork belly, essentially a giant chicharrón that happens to have some succulent meat attached to it. It's awesome.\",\n",
       "  \"What's not awesome are the menu's regular chicharrónes ($7). In the opening days of Cantina they almost seemed to crackle like Pop Rocks. Now they're painted with leaden pimento cheese, killing the delicate flavor and texture of the rind. Too bad. Also no good: A forgettable octopus tostada, fry bread topped with fresh cheese and vegetables (imagine a pizza minus salt and acid), and masa porridge with collards that taste like they came out of a can.\",\n",
       "  'House-made corn tortillas; lamb tacos; carnitas tacos',\n",
       "  \"And then there are the tacos ($6-$7), two to an order and about three bites each. The tortillas are (partially) made with an expensive brand of hominy called Anson Mills, so when they're good, they're great — vaguely sweet, and somehow light enough to dissolve in the mouth with little more resistance than a modernist foam. Some of the tacos come filled with lard-cooked brisket, sporting an intense umami roundness, or crispy bits of chewy pork, perfumed with cilantro. Others pack catfish so bland it's almost impossible to discern they contain any protein at all. And (overcooked) lamb tacos are so intensely seasoned with cumin and spices it's tough to discern any proper lamb flavor.\",\n",
       "  'The key is to eat them all immediately, as the tortillas grow soggy quickly. Unfortunately the kitchen sends out your (separate) orders of tacos at once, so by the time you pick up the third or fourth specimen, it nearly falls apart. \"Slow it down\" a trio next to us told the waiter, and minutes later, a runner was bringing over more tacos, even though there wasn\\'t an inch of space on their table.',\n",
       "  \"But here's a bigger problem: House-made flour tortillas, soft, sweet and toothsome as part of the burritos, are decidedly awful when grilled; they once arrived so arid I'm surprised they didn't turn into breadcrumbs when folded. They tasted of raw flour and threatened to ruin the lovely Peking pork and uni butter they came with. SELL.\",\n",
       "  'Rotisserie chicken',\n",
       "  \"Cantina offers no coffee or dessert; the goal is to get you in and out, and the result is that you'll rarely wait more than an hour to sit down. Half a rotisserie chicken ($22) is the right way to end your meal here. Wipe off the dense mole that covers the bird and dig into the fall-apart flesh; the meat bursts with a gloriously head-spinning flavor. Gorgeous stuff.\",\n",
       "  'On a final visit, Bowien himself came over to my table, with his newborn son strapped to his chest, and gave me a single tortilla chip. It was spicy, and vaguely cheese-y. \"It\\'s supposed to taste like a Dorito.\" he said. Right on.',\n",
       "  'Maybe I will get that Loco taco one day.'],\n",

       "  'Divided into three seating areas plus a handful of outdoor tables that run along Avenue A then turn the corner onto 12th Street, the décor might best be described as warehouse rustic – with bare brick and wood-paneled walls, a bar of salvaged timber and marble, plus cobbled-together tables at two heights. The prime decorative motif: wooden shipping flats of the kind favored by the trucking industry, serving as room dividers, wine shelves, and light bulb baffles. It makes the place look a little too much like your first college apartment.',\n",
       "  'Complimentary pita and lebna',\n",
       "  \"The menu is ambitious, encompassing 69 selections in 13 menu categories, with recipes from France, North Africa, and the Middle East sprinkled throughout. The homely little appetizing dishes known as mezze often show particular flair. One of the best arrives unbidden, and free of charge: a wooden tray of pitas dusted with the namesake za'atar, a combo of sesame seeds, crushed red sumac pods, and dried Levantine herbs. How the fragrance rises up when the warm bread hits the table! Alongside comes a saucer of labne, a thickened yogurt flooded with green olive oil. You could happily make a meal of just za'atar bread and labne.\",\n",
       "  'And you\\'ve probably never tasted better babaganoush ($7). Light and fluffy, it flaunts a smoky aftertaste. Lemon has been applied with a light hand. Usually made exclusively with dried favas, the bean stew called foul (pronounced \"fool\") adds chickpeas and navy beans to the usual recipe, which reeks pleasantly of funk. One of the most delicious things on the menu is arnabeet mekle ($7), an oil-moistened heap of fried, copper-colored cauliflower decorated with fronds of flat-leaf parsley, making what might be a dull side vegetable sing. There are some misses among the mezze, too, including little triangular spinach pies hard as rocks, and stuffed grape leaves that unravel like a cheap sweater as they bounce onto the table.',\n",
       "  'Arnabeet mekle; Kibbe naya',\n",
       "  \"Often spoken of as the national dish of Lebanon, kebbe kras is a pair of cracked-wheat shells enfolding a plain ground-beef filling. I might have been satisfied with Au Za'atar's, except I'd recently eaten the ones at Bar Bolonat, which are more delicate and flavorful. The real gem in the meat-bearing mezze department is kibbe naya ($10), a tartare of raw lamb macerated with spices and served with three accompaniments: olive oil, the fiery paste called harissa, and toum – a fluffy white substance doubtlessly inspired by French aioli. But while the toum you get in the city's Lebanese mainstays like Cedars Meat House (Astoria) and Al Salam (Bay Ridge) burns your lips with garlic, Au Za'atar's is sadly bland. When it comes to raw garlic, who wants subtlety? Nevertheless, kibbe naya constitutes one of the East Village's best tartares, and well worth ordering.\",\n",
       "  \"New York has a dearth of good North African restaurants, and couscous is the cuisine's most abused dish, dry as coarse sand blown by desert winds. Surprise! Au Za'atar's couscouses are unfailingly moist, and the one featuring three grilled lamb chops is, at $19, a very good deal. Another pleasant surprise is some of the French food. I was initially put off my feed by the frisee aux lardons ($13), which has few bacon lardons and lots of browned pita bits instead, seeming a little like bait-and-switch. Though quite beautiful with its two runny poached eggs plastered on top – the salad had no mustard vinaigrette to goose it up; in fact, no dressing at all. But the moules frites Dijonnaise ($16) swamped in white wine, mustard, and cream was totally on the money, with nice fries. And those same admirable fries came with steak au poivre ($18), a New York strip in green peppercorn sauce that was another of the menu's high points.\",\n",
       "  'Lamb and couscous; Moules frites Dijonnaise; Steak au poivre',\n",
       "  \"Ultimately, you may look at Au Za'atar's lengthy bill of fare and throw up your hands in indecision. Well, there is one ready escape valve from the pressure cooker of ordering. A set meal served family style is offered, representing a dependable selection of mezze and a heaping platter of fries and grilled meats –including merguez sausages, marinated chicken morsels, and lamb kebabs – plus a cubed vegetable salad, priced at $32 (for two) and $64 (for four).\",\n",
       "  \" That's a bargain compared with the other restaurants in the vicinity, which have been turning this stretch of Avenue A into a thriving restaurant row. (Funny, I remember it as a crack zone not that long ago.) These set meals are also a bargain compared with the rest of Au Za'atar's menu: Order one, share it with friends, and leave well-fed. Yes, most of the adventuresome dishes are lacking, but what do you want, adventure or dependable food?\",\n",
